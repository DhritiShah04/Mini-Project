  "heres another laptop you cant buy this is the Lenovo thinkbook 14 plus you can buy it but you have to import it its not available in Canada or the United States I ordered this from AliExpress off of a reseller brought it in and then fell in love with it and Ive been using it for 2 months basically as a daily driver this is a truly truly outstanding laptop to start the video before I even get into it Lenovo you need to bring this laptop to the West cuz this thing is an absolute killer 14in laptop relatively thin not crazy thin its actually a thick enough that it can actually accommodate quite good Cooling in this here does come with an Intel model this is the AMD model here has a gorgeous screen this is going to be a 3K screen 120 HZ refresh rate 100 dcip And its nice and bright this is a killer screen pretty much as good as you can expect from a nonoled screen all metal chassis gorgeous keyboard great trackpad dual nvme inside lots of RAM on this model here its truly fantastic let me show you why this laptop has been my daily driver for the past 2 months unfortunately you just cant buy it though okay and here is the laptop thinkbook 14 plus lovely laptop Ive been using it as a daily driver for I think about two months now you can see theres like fingerprints on it um yeah so I mean Im going to be very well versed in this product its not like a first look uh some of the footage I filmed was when I first got it uh you know doing comparisons and that but Ive actually legitimately been using this as a Dr driver for two months uh or whatever month and a half its probably been uh ports here are fantastic you get a thats the charging port its also 10 gigabit 10 gigabyte per second so 100000 megabytes second when transfers usba HDMI out thats a USB 4 and its a full function USB 4 you can power screen off of it you can do all that uh 40 GB per second 40 gigabyte per second so youll get transfers on like a nvme en closure of you know 3500 3700 megabytes per second headphone microphone combo Jack right side uh you get a little uh I dont know what you call this thing like a little hidden passageway with a usba in there and you can pop in your uh dongle on there which I do I just took it out for now uh you also get a Micro SD card which Ive used for video editing you get a other usba and an ethernet port and a Kensington lock slot fantastic for a little 14inch nongaming notebook here uh it looks really really nice all metal here well bring it in take a look at the weight I Ill cut to some footage of me comparing to the 16in uh variant of this and uh you know get an idea of that but you can see here its not super super heavy 157 g 1571 g thats about 32 33 lb its not super super super light but this is an allmetal chassis and its very robust its not exactly thick its not the thinnest like you know some impossibly Thin MacBook Air cuz this thing has some serious serious Cooling and uh components inside uh but it is you know its all metal so its going to be a little bit heavier than you might expect from you know a little plastic variant of this you know sometimes these things can be plastic basically but this is a fantastic fantastic itic laptop again Ive been using it as a daily driver I kind of got it to just do a review and then I was pretty much Blown Away by it so thats how these things happen right you start to do a review and then youre like well I guess Im using that for the next month and a half to two months uh m2 slot m2 slot that has a little tiny heat sink on it you see that there spoiler alert theres two m2 slots on this little 14inch laptop 2280 size there 2280 size there 2280 size there but they put in a 2242 its a little like half thing but its got a little adapter you just take it out I had a 2242 in this here I had a 2280 in this before actually I had two I had a 2 terab over here I took this out because it wasnt big enough I put in a 2 terab over there and I had a 4 terab over there uh the fans are pretty clean a little bit of dust in there and Ive done a lot of video editing on this but uh yeah I dont I keep a pretty I keep a pretty clean house around here uh you also get a massive battery 85w hour battery in this laptop isnt that just fantastic uh decent speakers too theyre the kind of higher wattage speakers theyre not the full siiz ones you get in like a yoga 9i which are just like massive Boomers but these sound good youll see when we get to the audio section its pretty good better than you know your generic business laptops by a mile upgradeable WiFi is also nice here too then you get this really robust cooling solution again this is just an 8845 HS right uh reasonably thick heat pipes I dont know if you can see that its hard to come some sometimes see thicker heat pipes than the G14 from Asus this thing runs cooler than an Asus G14 which is like three times the price isnt that funny uh you get dual fans here nice dense fins there and uh theyre run they run theres no annoying sounds and they run relatively quiet even during heavy video editing again Ive done dozen like maybe a dozen or two dozen videos on this laptop uh just an APU there theres no dedicated graphics on this model or anything like that uh but the cooling is very robust for what it is the only negative is the ram is soldered uh but you know 32 GB so whatever um you know taking out the sodum I guess they can get in dual nvme once you get up to 32 GB Im fine right thats going to be good for many years to come to be honest the laptop will probably wear out before that point you know youll be using it for years and years and years and years and years eventually wear out so I mean you get two nvme slots that you get over uh you know having sod in memory but you get 32 GB options so youll be fine right and it doesnt have dedicated graphics its not like youre doing like heavy video game programming where you need you know 96 gbt of RAM on a laptop like this its not really what its for its more for you know daytoday drivers or people like me who are doing video editing okay and heres a look at the inside of the laptop you can see the keyboard here its kind of that Microsoft Surface style where it has like a um little bit of a rubbery texture I guess Id call it uh these this is the thinkbook the yoga the idea pad 5 pros theyre all kind of like the same keyboard but sometimes they come with like a smoother texture like that sometimes they come with a rubber one uh then they have the chassis here really really nice uh all metal chassis here speakers firing you know little speaker vent here whatever uh nice big trackpad too um nice Sleek kind of package inside webcam up here with the slider you know nice clean simple package theyre not supposed to be like you know ridiculous and have all kinds of you know accents on them supposed to be a nice clean professional looking package lets have a quick look at the specs here uh so we get the 8845 HS the best processor thats out right now J uh June I guess its July 1st July 2nd of 2024 uh the new AMD and lenov and uh Intel stuffs going to drop so um you know this in a month or two this might be like the second best chip or the third best chip or whatever but as it stands right now its the best chip on the market fantastic uh then you get here 32 GB of RAM soldered but runs nice and fast 7500 MHz good for the GPU igpu uh weird SSD no idea um whatever it runs fine though real Tech uh WiFi six nice good WiFi whatever and then you get the 78m graphics yes yes I have gamed on this a lot and it games well put it that way um this is a import from China so it doesnt really have too much um you know software that comes with it it has none realistically uh they just clean they just put a fresh Windows install because language and that uh but you do you can get Vantage here and you can do your updates through Vantage I probably dont have any because I use this laptop all the time uh so you come in here and you do your updates it works totally fine right uh so lets have a look at the keyboard here uh I mean spoiler its going to be very similar to some of the other tests its going to be similar to some of the other laptops that Ive used recently with basically the same keyboard and I like them so lets do a quick typing test yeah so I mean its like a 10 out of 10 right so the only keyboard that are really better would be like a legion because theyre slightly higher travel slightly higher larger key caps but this thing has you know reasonably large key caps realistically um you know I dont know if you can see that on the camera uh but theyre relatively large for such a thin laptop and theres tons of travel nice and snappy uh you do get backlighting again its kind of the gray thing its not easy to see thats low right you can see it there right you can see that there its perfect for nighttime right its not going to like not super bright with RGB but its enough to light up the keys track pads fantastic its got this nice little cut metal here to give it a little bit of an accent you can see there if I get some reflectivity off it just its just a simple little thing that makes it look nice and pretty nice click on it just really really nice screen here is really something special and thats one of the reasons I got sucked into this laptop besides you know the build quality the performance massive battery good cooling all that whatever you know its just a killer laptop look at the screen here 1920 but the other way so we get 3000 by 1920 its like just should I have a 32k screen its above an 1800p screen isnt that crazy for a 14inch laptop this thing is very fine resolution interestingly it doesnt really seem to kill the battery this thing has crazy good battery life so you get a very fine resolution uh you also get kill it over here 120 HZ refresh rate so its super fine resolution its 120 HZ refresh rate and its 100 dcip And its bright its a bright screen its 100 dcip this thing is absolutely a killer screen uh but I retired an OLED screen laptop for this a very similar OLED screen laptop for this the shaen the adad 5 Pro which had a fantastic olded screen and it wasnt really much of a compromise because yeah I lost some blacks right uh but I gained not being glossy and its still such a nice screen like you can see here thats 100 dcip red right there you nice Vivid Reds here well go to this little part here killer contrast on the killer colors on that really really really vibrant Reds there just an absolutely gorgeous screen turn off that light there I kill off a little these lights here so its not so much washing it out just an absolutely killer screen and such minimal reflectivity and because its not an OLED you dont have to worry about burn in or anything like that which isnt the biggest issue these days but still you just use the laptop right so there are advantages to IPS everything doesnt have to be an OLED especially when you get such a nice uh IPS screen as this right and well bring that down get the Ive used this at night I cant really show it that well black uniformity is perfect theres no Bloom anywhere I use it at night all the time so for this is this is probably the nicest IPS screen Ive ever used realistically I mean you could make it glossy I guess which would make the colors even more vibrant somehow but I dont think its a good idea on this laptop because this is like something that people would actually probably be using in very bright environments and you get no gloss no glare on this at all like its completely non glare but the colors are so freaking vibrant despite that um so I mean this is the nicest IPS screen Ive ever used certainly its Music loud right around 80 or so 82 um decent decent sound overall yeah so a really good sound like obviously they it doesnt have that really lowend base that you know like a yoga 9i or a g 14 or something would have where its a ton of like really lowend deep base uh but there still is base its just you know not that really really low end and its nice and clear throughout the whole track there its really really theyre just nice speakers overall just okay were going to do some cine bench runs not for scores just for uh just for noise and temperatures but well just get this booted up here Im in performance mode you can see you can do function Q balanced silent high performance and that will change the amount of Watts that go to the CPU basically um so its something you might want to use so this is performance okay so we can see there its dumping a ton of watts into the CPU 65 watts in this thin little chassis looks like we are getting a little bit of heat there is it technically throttling though I dont know I dont think its actually throttling yet yeah its not throttling its just getting really hot uh but the fans are going Max Speed lets check the noise so 50 so like a quiet gaming laptop uh but its not an annoying sound theres no pitchy wine or anything like that so uh you know its not super annoying youll see theyll just take a peek at the scores here like 16000 thats the type of scores youd get on this chip on like a gaming laptop U because it it has a two fan cooling system and it can dump 65 Watts a lot of times these thin notebooks only dump 30 Watts or 35 Peak um its usually when you get into a 16in chassis where you can dump the full wattage little 65 Watts so thats going to give it a lot more performance here than some little thin variant of the same laptop because its able to dump more watts into it but it obviously runs a little bit warmer its really nice when youre doing video editing to just get that overhead you can drop it down to balance mode here well see the core package drop down to 50 or so much quieter temperature is dropping down fan spinning down most of the time you can do work on on this thing and honestly you can do in silent mode but even balance mode and its so much quieter wattage will drop down even more probably around 20 or so sustained yeah you can see that there you can see that uh its not even remotely warm anymore now the 8845 HS does scale like obviously you know 20 watts versus 35 watts versus 60 65 Watts there is a performance difference there but these AMD gpus these G AMD apus do very well on Lower Watts so itll still perform like you can see just a peak here right like this is silent Modes still going to get probably in like youre still going to get in five digits no problem on silent mode um so it really depends what youre trying to do just daytoday stuff honestly just even silent mode okay well just do a quick here we dont need to do a ton here we know what the 8845 HS is capable of and that is a lot uh so were here 60 watts on the system there uh were here in balers gate were at 1200p on medium I just threw on a quality d uh quality FSR you dont even need it in the indoor areas you can see they were at 60 FPS right this these apus are very capable um know this is pulling twice the Watts of what an Rog Al or Legion go can do uh so thats good lets go like this and throw it down to balance thatll give us more uh drop down wats 45 no drop in performance right so you dont need to be in performance mode the scaling on these apus is it kind of does a curve and then it kind of levels off so I usually game on balance because it doesnt make a difference those extra 15 wats dont really do anything uh then you can throw it down a silent here and youll still get relatively good performance well go like that there right 23 Watts were still at 55 right so you can pretty much game in most games with s on silent with the Fans not really going uh you know 30 watts is around where those handhelds run and this has a pretty robust cooling system in comparison so you know the fans barely need to do anything just kind of slightly move some arrow and youre going to be fine if youre playing very demanding 2024 titles you know on higher settings you may need to throw it up into balanced mode for example just to get those extra Watts but you can see here I mean its going to run incredibly well here right like this is an indoor area so its not the most demanding area of the game but this game is super hard to run thats why I do it uh do my tests on these apus in balers gate because it really does slam the CPU and the GPU and uh gives you a good idea of kind of a worst case scenario all right lets just eat her in there bye uh and then if well go to just an outdoor area well just kind of go and get an idea of what it will be like Outdoors well go to the most demanding area in the game I guess um by far and kind of get an idea there okay and heres a look at balers gate itself like the city of balers gate youre going to see its going to drop down a bit here so were going to have to throw up the performance mode probably at least not in silent right and now now youre going to youre going to get those little drop downs there as it loads in but usually it does stabilize this is the most demanding area in the game by far uh just massively more demanding than other areas in the game uh typically in here youre going to want to throw on a little bit more scaling or you can turn it down to low just whatever uh were only on quality right so we can throw it on balanced or probably balanced will be fine to be honest uh just in the city of balers gate its just so hard to run right and now you can see were stable those lows like the average is fine 40 or so and then the lows have come up here so this is the most demanding area in the game so if you can run it here youre going to be singing throughout the vast majority of the game so what do I think of the laptop well lets go over the pros first all day battery life youre going to get 12 to 20 hours on idle youre going to be burning around 4 Watts or so sometimes even 35 Watts on idle which is very good at 100 brightness and youre still going to get around 8 to 12 hours on YouTube at 1080p60 partially due to how efficient the system is partially due to to the fact that it has a gigantic 84w battery youre also going to get incredibly good CPU and GPU performance that 8845 HHS processor is incredibly performant in CPU tasks and the igpu is best in class as of right now youre going to get a killer screen on it 145 in 100 dcip 120 HZ refresh rate absolutely killer screen on this laptop you get ports Galore ports Galore on this laptop no shortage despite the fact that its 14inch its a very robust design and it has a great keyboard and trackpad uh and then if youre talking about what the negatives are well I mean you cant buy it at least not in the west unless youre willing to import it so thats going to be huge negative so my takeaway is Lenovo bring this laptop to the West it will sell its outstanding and we deserve it",

  "You have to be careful when importing nonNorth American laptops Many of those laptops dont come with a TPM chip for BitLocker drive encryption Many foreign countries do not allow drive encryption so the TPM chip is barred by law Since the laptop was imported from China drive encryption is illegal there so that laptop wont have a TPM chip You can get around it with a BitLocker password lock but it requires extra work to configure it and its nowhere nearly as secure as a TPM chip I replaced many Lenovo laptop motherboards professionally in years past On occasion I received a nonTPM chip equipped motherboard that was not meant for NA markets They would have to ship the correct MB and I had to go through replacing the MB for a second time what a pain",

  "16 have 2 slot upgradeable ram",
  "AMZZZMA its soldered",

  "No that doesnt make sense",
  "TechGuyBeau apparently there is black glue between the cpu and the socket",
  "TechGuyBeau the black glue is going to expand because of heat and make cause pseudo soldering issues",
  "Did you ever figure out which seller it is",
  "Thats the risk You basically lose out on OEM warranty But you save a lot of money Luckily you CAN buy replacement parts But most likely the warranty is not usable",
  "TechGuyBeau yeah I thought so Personally I would pull the trigger but if my parents found out I dont think theyd be particularly happy lol Can you tell me from what seller are you getting these laptops from AliExpress if you dont mind",
  "I am also curious to know which seller from Aliexpress you bought it from Also was it hard to wipe everything out and do a fresh install on a laptop that came everything in Chinese How is the layout of the keyboard compared to the US layout Thanks",

  "nomeduele0 I dont understand what THAT means but thanks for replying I went m checked more different brands like Acer and Asus n now planning on getting one of them believe Asus is better so probably that",
  "ThinkPad is I think a much older brand It was started by IBM if Im not wrong Theyre famous for their build quality durability and repairability I think Lenovo made ThinkBook as a marketing maneuver to overcome the poor reputation of Yoga Books Thats why the crossover of the name with ThinkPad You should most probably buy a ThinkPad P series",

review model in one of no novos many weekly offers for 450 or 565 with no operating system bargain when you consider the features it offers good upgrades the SSD WLAN and RAM modules can be all swapped out and upgraded whereare these days and more laptops have solded on memory good inputs the keyboard and touch pad are both comfortable to use for long hours the keys have 15 mm key travel

display panel will be fine but the low brightness level of 300 nits and the poor color space coverage of 45 ntse makes the think book unsuitable for image editing work flimsy ethernet while having an ethernet port is a bonus dont you hate the flap designs that feel clumsy to use plus once you plug in the network cable its a difficult job to pull out again if you were in the market for a budget friendly 14in business laptop what other laptops would you be looking at in no particular order heres some to consider Dell fostro 14 HP Pro book 440 G10 Aus Zenbook 14 MSI Prestige 14 Evo Asus Swift go 14 the Lenovo thinkbook 14 Gen 6 is a reliable and dependable compact laptop the display and performance is good enough for general office or working from home tasks just dont use it for creator to editing jobs or AAA gaming two rare sodm slots to upgrade the memory up to 64 GB ddr5 plus the Dual m2 SSD slots are upgradeable for expandable storage cant complain about the number of ports including a funderbolt 4 USBC port at this wallet friendly price tag a useful SD card reader and RJ45 Port the keyboard and touchpad are a joy to use for long periods battery run time is almost good for a day workload dont forget to upgrade to the 60w battery op the noovo thinkbook 14 Gen 6 sits quietly under the radar from its famous cousin the think pad range theres no wow highlights but it

  "Right off the bat the cheaper less expensive Thinkbook 14 that is marketed as not as premium as the Thinkpad T series line has 2 sodimm slots 2 ssd slots upgradeable wifi card and replaceable battery all in a 14 aluminum chassis which cant be said about the 14 Thinkpad TP series laptops Seems this is a better laptop",
  "Thanks to you i brought this laptop Absolutely love ittt",
  "I just wish makers would give the variants more distinct names so you can refer to them without specifying all the concerned specs",
  "Excellent review ive got the Gen6 16inch i713700h model Great performance for everyday work",
  "Ive been using the same Thinkbook i51335u as reviewed for a year now For gamers out there it runs Minecraft Sodium client with about 20 chunk render distance with no problems obviously the performance drops a little when unolugged It also gets a little warmer on the left side of the keyboard",
  "Excellent review Thanks",
  "Great review Just want to mention this model has a potential design oversight with a description and solution below With this solution the machine is silent for almost all regular tasks whereas before the fans would kick on often when installing software for example Description Lenovo seems to have created an ingenious cooling system which pulls air from the underside of the chassis across the memory and storage The ventilation grid is partially covered in the center forcing air across other components rather than relying on a dual fan system In theory this helps keep all components cooler and is a great way to utilize a single fan However the fresh air enters closer to the processor and ram leaving unnecessarily high ambient temperatures on the storage which is located adjacent to the heat pipe leading to the fan The potential design oversight To be effective at cooling the mechanism relies on the condition that air is being moved which produces noise in the process This got me wondering if the storage was causing unnecessary stress on the cooling system This simple test involved monitoring the temperatures both idle and under load during a speed test PCIE slot 1 idled at 37C to 42C with a max load of 79C on the speed test PCIE slot 2 idled at 26C to 31C with a max load of 89C on the speed test This proved the drive was susceptible to ambient temperatures from the heat pipe while in slot 1 and the cooling system was working on the drive under load as well and producing noise in the process Solution When the primary drive is in PCIE slot 2 the machine runs dramatically quieter but did hit an uncomfortably high max as mentioned above However placing a 3mm heat sink on the drive do not do this the lid doesnt close yielded max temperatures below 80C putting it in line with being actively cooled I have since ordered a 1mm heat sink which is rated around 6C to 9C which should keep the drive within comfortable temperatures under load which does not happen frequently anyway In the meantime I am trading a potentially high max temperature on the drive while under load for a much quieter machine pending the heat sink tldr Try placing your primary drive into PCIE slot 2 with a 1mm heat sink and see if the machine runs cooler and quieter overall",
  "Awesome review great attention to detail Thanks",
  "Great find it really does offer a lot for the very reasonable price tag Especially as one can buy the min RAM SSD via Lenvo and then upgrade DIY yourself for the best value I am looking at buying the Ryzen 7 7730U 8GB DDR4 256GB SSD basic display I connect to monitors 99 of the time for 700 Can upgrade the RAM to 16GBx2 32 and 1TB SSD and thats a pretty awesome package for under 850 in total",
  "Fantastic Review Absolutely complete thanks",
  "As mentioned previously I bought a version that came with the Ryzen 5 7430u Not the 7530u with one 16gb RAM then added a second 16gb stick It also has the 45wh battery with the same 300 nit screen as the one reviewed in this video and the 512gb SSD I paid USD equivalent of 502 plus 32 for the extra 16gb stick of RAM I feel like this is quite a good laptop for the 534 Ive spent It benchmarks well On Time Spy I got almost the same score on 3 tries Total 1371 Graphics 1208 CPU 5911 This is better than average for a 7530u so Im impressed Battery life lasted me a whole day at work and I was using it a lot Still had over 30 at the end of the day",
  "awesome review very detailed",
  "good review very concise yes more laptop reviews like this",
  "I just ordered this with the 7430u not the 7530u and it seems like the battery life will be decent even with the smaller battery Thanks a lot for the review",
  "Thanks for this excellent review in particular the db measurements Im thinking of picking the i713700h version for music production I realise this would probably result in the fans running at higher speeds pretty much constantly Would 43db be the max volume on the i713700h version also",
  "I have bad experience with Thinkbook The old model 13s G2 have motherboard issues Most case is the usb typec fail to charge during restart it stuck at bios even after update firmware Used for 15yrs changed my board x3 times Im still using it though but plan to sell when warranty over Btw another concerning issue it gets very hot easily even when processor usage low You will notice that the fan will be at full speed very loud This indicate that the heat dissipation is very bad on this model Maybe the newer model might improve on it but for one Im not getting another Thinkbook again Sorry lenovo",
  "It arrived yesterday despite having 45 NTSC it handles reflections very well I dont know why but the reflections are more noticeable when I record with my cell phone but live it looks very good and good for office work and watching videos that screen is fine as for sound I recommend installing Fx sound it will increase the volume of the device",
  "Good review Im gonna order this with the ryzen 7 7730u",
  "Excellent review it helped me a lot to pick the same model with similar specs So I went on the official Lenovo site customised a PC and was ready to make the payment BUT THEN I read the message Expected delivery 45 weeks so I immediately cancelled it In the 21st century this is just unacceptable or more like ridiculous I also checked the reviews of the website and its 15 stars out of 5 trusted reviews Italy So practically all your recommendations make only sense if you have more than a month to wait And I dont Its 2024 for goodness sake Weve got oneday delivery",
  "Hence why I bought one myself when I saw the specs and price Use it as a daily driver for IT support tasks ethernet port comes in handy too",
  "I think new thinkpad is nothing special Yoga line up is far better tahn thinkpad The only think thinkpad do better is costumer support and warranty",
  "Dovecomputers Hi Have you tried to run any virtual machines on this laptop",
  "Dovecomputers Have you had a look at this models hinge I couldnt open the laptop with one hand from the middle of the screen edge but prying it open with 2 hands Reading about thinkbook hinge breaks really worries me too",
  "depressioncherry Deployed several hundred of these ThinkBooks and not had an issue with the hinges The review model has been used every day for several months and not had an issue either",
  "The only reason why Im even considering the thinkbook is because the ThinkPad are fingerprint magnets",
  "depressioncherry Whats wrong with opening your laptop with two hands Thats totally normal",
  "Dovecomputers glad to hear as Reddit has lots of hinge reports",
  "Great to hear Still use mine for diagnostics work on a daily basis",
  "What is it like Its probably going to be my next too",
  "What about the rigidity of its body Some reviewers mentioned problems with that",
  "TheSason666 i mean its made of STEEL so its ok that its rigid steel good plastic not good",
  "love this too i just have one question if the screen qualty can be brighter is there a way",
  "TheSason666 its build in metal no worries but i heard the keyboard is a bit swell in some individual product",
  "Is your i713700h model quite noisy in basic tasks And if you use some programs like easy 3D or which ones did you use Does the cooling system cope with the operation of this processor Sorry for the inaccurate translation because I am writing with the help of a translator",
  "These Intel processors are designed to run at a high temperature As a result the fans rarely kick on for regular tasks even on the 13700H variant However this was not always the case in my experience As noted above this model has a possible design oversight which can be easily fixed by moving the primary drive from PCIE Slot 1 to PCIE Slot 2 This is because in Slot 1 the drive shares ambient temperatures with the processor as it is located closely to the processor heat pipes By moving the primary drive into PCIE Slot 2 with a thin heat sink Not sticker type max total height including thermal pads 15mm it outperforms the potential active cooling under load in Slot 1 and reduces idle temperatures and noise by a significant amount The mylar covering above the RAM also spans from the heat pipe on the processor to the IO on the side of the notebook creating an additional miniature heat sink When performing a ram upgrade the mylar should be carefully attached back to the copper pipe above the processor ivanE587",
  "Lintersuh1kk So does it mean that you cant use any m2 drive in slot 1 Thats quite a bummer",
  "Update The heat sink on the NVME reduced temperatures dramatically Although the vendor rated the heat sink for 69C it actually went from 79C on average to about 4751C during the tests 2832C The processor is the 13700H variant and the fans manage to stabilize it around 93C with moderate fan speed which is surprisingly not that loud According to Intel the processors are specifically designed to operate hotter while under load This could explain the 93 mark is maintained without the fans on full The dualchannel RAM 32GB total is reaching 73 and above during tests which does seem on the toasty side But obviously I am trying to nitpick on performance here in a practical way Similar to the SSD I attempted to place a 001mm conductive material which did absolutely nothing to RAM temperatures A larger heat sink 05mm is on order and will update this with results on the memory So far really happy with this machine Even with added upgrades the machine came out reasonably priced Side note Also replaced the thermal paste with PTM7950 and it did not do much on that front Idle temps were reduced by 13C but under load it was not much of a difference Lenovo did a great job applying thermal paste to this machine on the two that were ordered edit Removed the specific cost above because it is not particularly relevant",
  "Final update After much deliberation and experimentation with ram cooling solutions it is not the way to go The mylar which covers the ram has a thin sheet of aluminum which connects to one of the two heat pipes cooling the CPU It then connects to the IO on the left side of the notebook effectively creating another heat sink Additionally mylar is great at protecting from interference which could be important when working near some machines While the ram temperatures do decrease with a heat sink they still maintain within safe operating temperatures without it tldr The mylar covering the memory slots is actually a functional heat sink and should not be removed It also protects the ram from interference and the ram maintains within decent operating temperatures without a heat sink The first solution with a thin 05mm heat sink on the primary storage in NVME slot 2 with default configuration elsewhere is likely the best outcome for this machine",
  "Lintersuh1kk hi have you had a look inside at this models hinge i couldnt open the laptop without prying it open with 2 hands and this seems to be considered too tight reading about common hinge breaks of lenovo thinkbook really worries me",
  "The hinge is attached to the body by about 3 screws on each side On this model G6 the point of failure appears to be the display and frame itself not the hinges or where they are attached The display can open up to 180 degrees and maintain a position Going beyond that would likely cause problems but would take force For whatever reason opening notebooks with one hand has been considered a luxury feature generally at the expense of a display that doesnt maintain its position too well When this notebook is opened at any angle it tends to stay in that position Personally I think opening with two hands is a good tradeoff for hinge stability When opening it would be best not to use too much force concentrated in a small area There is a flat area above the frontfacing webcam so prying with a palm on that spot and avoiding the very edges of the display may help reduce concentrated force depressioncherry",
  "Lintersuh1kk is this all on 14 inch model If yes do you think that 16 inch model has a better thermals due to bigger body Im still skeptical between 14 and 16",
  "xsAMOR A teardown video by LaptopMedia on the 16 version shows near identical internals including the ssd by the heat pipe Any improvement would likely be insignificant There is little wasted space in the 14 version but it appears the 16 has plastic bridging on some components to fit in the larger chassis It really comes down to preference of form and any thermal improvement is likely to be marginal",
  "Lintersuh1kk thanks so much for this in depth info Does this method reduce max fan noise even during the most CPU intensive tasks Also do you have a link to the nvme heatsink you used or what I should search for as have never purchased this type of heatsink before Thanks again",
  "It is a hidden gem of a laptop Managed to pick up this review model for 450570 Crazy for the specs and upgrade options Use it daily for IT support tasks onsite Hence why the rare RJ45 port was attractive to me too",

  "Dovecomputers Thats great What nvme model do you recommend me nowadays I am looking for a balance between reliability and performance Thanks very much for your attention",
  "asg88 Crucial P3 Plus SSD for every day use Performance find online deals on the WD Black ones Mine are WD Blacks on Amazon deals",
  "Dovecomputers thanks for sharing me your setup I wil take it into account",
  "148kg or 327 lbs",
  "owslyst Not much in it but the 1335U has a slight edge over the 7730U Single core the Intel is much faster with multicore the AMD has a small advantage",
  "Yes the AMD Ryzen 7 7730u is much faster and cheaper than the Intel Core i5 1335u but it is also a lastgeneration CPU refresh This means that it does not support Thunderbolt or USB 4 DDR5 or PCIe Gen 4 However it is more efficient with much better battery life The limitations of DDR4 and PCIe Gen 3 are not noticeable in most realworld scenarios but Thunderbolt 4 and speedefficiency are the most important differentiating factors in my view If you want a better battery life with a more powerful CPU go with the Ryzen 7 7730u If you need to transfer large files quickly go with the i5 1335u My bad for any English faux pas not my first language",
  "TheVoodooochile Please advise on which processor is better to choose from these i713700H or Ryzen 7 7730U It is needed for daily use and for working with simple 3D models Will the cooling cope with the i713700H processor and will it not get very hot and make constant noise Sorry for the inaccurate translation because I am writing with the help of a translator",
  "ivanE587 The i713700H is much more powerful than the 7730U there will be a compromise with heat fan noise and battery life as the 7730U is aimed at maximum battery efficiency",
  "TheVoodooochile what if i go with ryzen 5 7530u and it says it has pcie gen 4 and ddr4 sodimm and the new thinkbook 16 has even wuxga display with all this features that too at budget range so what do u think But its 16 And 15 has pcie g3 and ips display Im getting confused where shld i go shld i take bigger screen for all good features or suggest something nice",
  "TheVoodooochile DDR5 opens the possibility of having 2x48GB ram For some people me its important factor",
  "Thanks I would avoid the smaller 45Wh battery and go with the 60Wh in the UK its only 10 more",
  "Thanks The AMD Gen 7 only has the choice of AMD Ryzen 3 7335U AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS and AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS processors The Intel version does have the weaker Core Ultra 7 155U Reviewing the Core Ultra 7 165U in the X1 Carbon the fans spin up constantly if set on best performance mode",
  "Dovecomputers Thanks a lot but I cant understand why Lenovo uses Ryzen xx35HS Zen 3 High Performance instead of xx40U Zen 4 Low Power CPUs for the ThinkBook 14",
  "gunta ThinkBook budget range ThinkPad premium range with nicer specs",
  "True Almost like laptop webcams the manufacturers have neglected these two areas over the years",
  "Youll be surprised how many people have USB TypeA accessories around Plus in my line of work electronic equipment still use typea diagnostic cable connections Hence why this ThinkBook 14 is the Swiss knife of laptops",
  "never seen a mouse with typec",
  "Yes there are two M2 2280 PCIe 30 x4 slots in the ThinkBook 14 Gen 6",
  "The Intel i513500H is a more powerful processor compared to the Useries processors Therefore battery life will be lower with this CPU Select a Useries CPU if you need better battery life",
  "Thank you very much I will consider this purchase carefully",
  "Battery life wont be good due to the i713700H full fat processor Display is average as its a budget business laptop Lenovo save the better ones for their premium ThinkPad lineup",
  "Dovecomputers The processor has 8E cores and 6P cores in a biglittle arrangement It is Intels trick up the sleeve regarding battery and perhaps rather understated Have one with the same configuration and the battery is now 71 with an estimated 65 hours remaining which seems about right",
  "I need lihtweight and small laptop to work from bed I am thinking about buying Acer Swift Go Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5 and this one Acer Swift Go is liftweight and small Ideapad Flex 5 can bend flex for 360 degrees and Lenovo Thinkpad that I plan to buy has stronger CPU i7 13700H in comparison with other two They have i7 1355U What do you reccomend",
  "Between this thinkbook and the HP Probook 440 G10 which would you recommend as a more durable machine",
  "Do you know how it compares to the Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 5 in terms of build quality the keyboard and performance",
  "Finger print scanner available or not",

  "In india both fingerprint sensor with backlit keyboard is available",
  "is there a way or is it possible to upgrade the screen quaity of 14 g6 irl",
  "I cant decide between 14 and 16 inch thinkbook model in both cases I would go with AMD Ryzen 7 7730U and bigger battery Mainly for Office tasks and some browsing maybe 12 timesyear I would take laptop on vacation but not any big tasks are planned I assume battery wouldnt drain faster with Ryzen 7 as with Ryzen 5 or 3 with regular workload because TDPs are the same If someone can recommend something thanks in advance",
  "What about rigidity of its body",
  "Lenovo lineup is very confusing Ideapad and Thinkbook is very similar Then Ideapad Pro is very similar with Yoga series",
  "Is this the touch screen model",
  "This or p14s gen 4 lowest settings amd",
  "I wish it had a bit better screen",
  "Would the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G6 14 WUXGA Laptop i71355U 16GB 512GB W11P be good for doing big data and business ops I regularly handle excel with 50mB sheets with a lot of data",
  "Is this laptop good for Fortnite",
  "No LED for hddwless etc",
  "I am not sure if it is something with my machineits keyboard lighting doesnt light up when I touch the trackpad its keys has to be pressed to wake it up Its a bizarre issue thats bugging me since day 1 of using this",
  "The ThinkBook 14 Gen 6 Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 and Yoga Pro 7 are all very good working from bed I can attest to this",
  "Dovecomputers I bought Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5",
  "E14 chassis slightly better than the ThinkBook Keyboard similar typing experience although the E14 has the trackpoint E14 has slower DDR4 memory compared to DDR5 on the ThinkBook",
  "Did you get your answer I was also planning to buy the same",
  "If you get the Intel i713700H model with 16 or 32GB RAM then yes",
  "if u still need suggestionsconsider gen 7 r7 7735u has better igpu 680m 660m in 7535u literally same as vega 7",
  "rubanlourdu thanks for advice I saw that new series have better igpus first I ordered g6 then ordered g7 returned g6 canceled g7 because 7735hs is also just updated old architecture zen3 and theres already zen 5 but I have doubt that AMD cpus perform over time my Ryzen 5 3400g cant play GTA sam as 3 years ago",
  "I use it every day for work 7 months still looks new Weve deployed hundreds of the 14 and 16 models not had one back yet",

  "Yoga slim pro slim5thinkbook slim3 V15 slim1 slim5 pro lineup has discontinued",
  "Look at the similar IdeaPad Slim 5 with OLED display panel",
  "Dovecomputers Seems like alot of the IdeaPads have touch screen They need some options that are nontouch screen",
  "my country has the upgradable choice of IPS 100RGB",
  "But for business banking accounting SQL databases and so on this type of screen and its resolution are ideal",
  "Yes we have clients who use this with Dynamics spreadsheets and BI",
  "Dovecomputers ok nice would you recommend upgrading to 64GB ram",

  "Im thinking about Minecraft XD",
  "PlatinAviation eh I have this exact laptop as a school laptop and I can play Minecraft all too well on it Im asking if its good for Fortnite to see if its worth going through the pain of bypassing admin lock and formatting the PC",
  "I lot of modern laptops have stopped adding these LED indicator lights",
  "If youre shopping for a 14inch Lenovo laptop consider the ThinkPad L1 14 Gen 5 and the ThinkBook 14 Gen 7 Both are great business machines but theyre built for slightly different users Lets break down the differences so you can figure out which one is right for you First off these are both 14in laptops meaning if youre looking for portability these are great and take up less space than 15 or 16in laptops However even with a 14in screen these laptops dont feel extremely small either due to the 16x10 aspect ratio which allows you to see slightly more and makes it easier to browse the web These arent the lightest laptops Lenovo has to offer but for this price point the ThinkBook 14 and L14 are perfect In terms of cosmetic appearance the main difference will be the color The ThinkBook 14 comes in its signature silver gray finish while the ThinkPad comes in its iconic black finish The ThinkPad L14 is part of Lenovos classic ThinkPad lineup That means a military tested ultra durable chassis businessgrade security features and a slightly more utilitarian design Weight is about 30 to 31 lb depending on configuration The ThinkBook 14 Gen 7 on the other hand is all about modern style Its got an all aluminum build thin profile and still comes in at about 304 lb Its durable but its not quite as rugged as a ThinkPad When it comes to the keyboard this is where the ThinkPad shines The L14 like I mentioned in previous videos has one of my favorite keyboards on a ThinkPad to date Its a perfect balance of smooth but durable It has a medium weight to it with a great texture which helps your fingers to get a good grip on each keystroke The ThinkBook has a great keyboard as well and its as good if not better than most modern ThinkPads in my opinion However if I had to directly compare it to the L14 the L14 wins hands down But take into account like I said the L14s keyboard is just built different You cant go wrong with either at the end of the day In terms of specs the ThinkPad L14 we have in stock comes with the Ryzen 7 Pro 7735U which gives you eight cores and 16 threads That makes it stronger for multitasking heavier workloads and longterm office use We also carry an Intel Ultra 5 version The Thinkbook 14 Gen 7 uses the Ryzen 57535HS a six core 12thread chip Its still fast and the HS chip is tuned for performance but youre getting fewer cores For daytoday productivity both are plenty powerful but if you want more headroom for multitasking or running multiple business apps at once the L14 pulls ahead We do carry an Intel CPU version of the ThinkBook as well Graphics are pretty close Both rely on integrated Radeon graphics You can do light creative work and casual tasks but neither is meant for gaming or heavy design workloads Both have 14in WXGA displays with a 16x10 aspect ratio giving you more vertical workspace than a standard 1080p screen The L14 offers configurations up to 400 nits brightness While the ThinkBooks panel is rated at 300 nits so if you work in brighter environments the L14 might give you a slight advantage Both come with touchscreen options When it comes to port selection both are excellent Each has USBA USBC with power delivery fullsize HDMI and Ethernet ports The ThinkBook has a slight edge as it also comes with a fullsize SD card reader Nevertheless these 14in laptops come with even more ports than most larger laptops When it comes to pricing the ThinkPad starts at 999 while the Thinkbook starts as low as 599 all the way up to 899 depending on configuration So who should buy which The ThinkPad L14 is best for business professionals organizations and power users who value durability security and the extra multitasking performance of the Ryzen 7 Pro chip Its the more serious entrylevel business machine The ThinkBook 14 on the other hand is best for small business owners students or professionals who want a lighter more stylish laptop with more storage flexibility Its modern sleek and still powerful enough for everyday business tasks Now if you asked my personal opinion Id spend the extra on the L14 because of the ThinkPad reliability track record and the fact that I do a lot of light to medium tasks beyond just spreadsheets However I see the Thinkbook being amazing for those who want to save a few dollars and just need an everyday reliable machine Whether it be streaming web browsing or social media I think its a great laptop for students and seniors alike as it doesnt break the bank comes with everything they need but its more durable than most other cheap laptops out there and definitely better than a Chromebook If you have any questions feel free to comment below As always you can find these laptops in stock at our store Whether you need it for yourself or need to buy in bulk for your business contact us today for more info or visit us in person Were also an authorized Lenovo service provider so we can service your machine hasslefree if you ever run into an issue",
