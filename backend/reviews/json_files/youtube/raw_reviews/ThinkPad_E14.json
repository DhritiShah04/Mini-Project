  "Hello everyone Join me at the beach in 4K to discuss the Lenovo ThinkPad E14 to determine if its any good and if you should buy one yourself As Ive said before on this channel the Lenovo ThinkPad is one of my favorite computers possible Why you ask Well because its built well they look cool and theyre very serviceable Theyre fast They are just sort of the Toyota of laptops Theyre reliable They dont have a lot of drama They just they just do Wardrobe change Now the ThinkPad series laptops in the last decade have creeped up in price Basically theyve started kind of hitting anywhere between the000 and 2000 ranges depending on how you want to how you want to deck one out Thing is though is that these E14s can now be found online eBay Amazon the works for as little as 700 sometimes cheaper if youre getting a good sale And that is exceptional value for this machine See the thing is is that it really only has a few Achilles heels Namely the speakers are absolutely horrible Its not the lightest and thinnest thing in the world especially for a 14in computer I mean for example here we have a 15in MacBook Air And the 15inch MacBook Air is not that much wider and deeper I dont know if you can see that on camera Its not that much wider and deeper than than the E14 but it has much much much better battery life It is much much much faster It has a much much much nicer screen with much much much nicer speakers All is to say that the E14 ThinkPad is a little girthy And youd think that that extra weight would translate into more power or battery better battery life but unfortunately it does not The battery life on this computer is a little bit scant getting somewhere between 8 to 10 hours of practical use which you know in todays day and age is like enough to get you by for a full a full workday but ultimately I would have loved to see a little bit something better out of this class of computer But where its poor in battery life and speaker quality it absolutely is rich in IIO Left side of the computer gets two Thunderbolt 4s a USB typeA port a fullsize HDMI and then of course a TRR R S jack And then on the other side youve got Kensington lock because everybody uses Kensington lock Another type A port And then a little talking Ethernet jack What I really like is that Lenovo ditched the whole proprietary connector in favor for a USBC charger because it doesnt run on solar energy But thats really nice because when that battery inevitably dies youll have a wide array of different options at your disposal to charge it with Bottom line is that the computer is a pretty welle equipped little business machine which is exactly what the ThinkPad series was designed for in the first place And I feel like Lenovo is doing a pretty good job keeping with that theme on these particular computers I dont really have a huge wish list of stuff I would like to see improved on it other than maybe the battery life and the speakers but otherwise for 700 bucks you can do a whole lot worse And in fact I would go so far as to say that it might be one of the best 700 computers you can buy So bottom line is do I recommend the Lenovo ThinkPad E14 I do Despite some of its shortcomings it is a pretty nice laptop with a lot of decent features And overall if youre somebody thats looking to do things like productivity work office tasks a lot of Firefox tabs Chrome etc and so forth and you want to do things like podcasting on site because of the Thunderbolt 4 you can plug in switches and microphones and all that good stuff If you want to do even a little bit of of video editing like some compressed 4K light gaming like Minecraft or Roblox then I think that the E14 is one of the best bangs for your buck especially considering the fact that it is very serviceable and they do tend to be made pretty bulletproof So should you buy the Lenovo ThinkPad 14 Yes you should",
  "810 of battery is fine People act like theyre coding in a tent in the woods on a mountain somewhere when in reality theyre either in a classroom office or cafe plugged in all day anyway",
  "Im in love with the way you speak and present Kudos",
  "I just bought one today had Windows preinstalled and switched to Linux Mint It feels good good screen good keyboard good mousepad etc",
  "just got the E14 with Ultra 7 155U and 32GB for about 1300 via their Memorial Day sale was 800 off",
  "i didnt find ryzen version in my country should i go with ultra 5 125u or not good",
  "Its great as a sysadmin laptop where you dont need all the power on the laptop but some is always good to have for whatever With dedicated Ethernet port and WiFi 6e as well Thunderbolthdmi for video output And usbc charging instead of the weird port they had before Its quite nice to bring abound Sure the T14 is nicer than the E14 but for me locally its twice the price well",
  "4th Gen Es have terrible Wifi cards and 8GB of RAM soldered to the board with a SODIMM expansion slot for up to 40GB which is really bizarre IMHO E is the economy model and it shows under the hood I just went through battles to the point of not even being able to boot into BIOS but manage to bring it back around for how long I cant say IMHO spring for the T series",
  "Whats the battery life like general use like browsing and ms office on 5070 brightness",
  "Is this good for intense coding and moderate editing",
  "I just bought a refurbished e14 for 247 Excited to see how well it does with arch linux installed when it arrives",
  "Not just ebay Its available new for 700 and thats enough for me to jump in",
  "E14 G5G6 AMD No Thunderbolt 4xUSB 32 Intel 1xTB 2xUSB 32 G6 3x G5 1xUSB2 Speakers good if Dolby Dynamic used Dual NVMe drive Battery is decent Fun review",
  "Loved the video and the way you talk mate Thank you for this great video",
  "I found one used for like 180 euros Im gonna buy it",
  "Ok but can you still throw these out a window and act like nothing happened afterwards",
  "i saw Audio By Harman Speaker on touchpad left side should have pretty good sound performance",
  "This one vs the dell latitude 7450 Ultra 5 Which one would you buy",
  "well yeah comparing a MacBook to an older generation ThinkPad isnt exactly a fair match yeah its much much much better but its also much much much more expensive",
  "Im looking at gen 6 of the E14 with AMD and it does ot look like it has USB 40 Thunderbolt on them",
  "LOL agreed and lets be honest even mountains have usbc chargers around now",
  "I live in a village in India and its more like a forest So I do care",
  "rubyciide5542 Well ok then lets get you a computer with good battery life",
  "coding in a tent in the woods this is literally one of my use cases for a laptop I do a lot of coding work while camping",
  "I dont know if you have used windows on that machine or not but even if u didnt what is the battery life like on linux Is it more than the 810 hours that this review claimed",
  "lustergo Bro I havent used Windows on it just Linux and I get 56 hours of battery life with Mint",
  "I wish I can learn to use Linux mint well",
  "Id like to buy this same thinkpad and switch to linux Do you know if the preinstalled windows license works on a guest VM in KVM",
  "Ultra 5 125U 16512 how much",
  "any update also what gen it is",
  "Glad you liked it Thanks for watching",
  "ComputerStuff Just placed my order mate Cheers",
  "Were ending on a happy note Thats good",
  "Almost every time a manufacturer advertises something like that the speakers are butt",
  "Hmm good question WHich one is cheaper and by how much",
  "Yeah but what about the macBook of same year release as this E14 hmmm",
  "Thanks for the heads up on that",
  "700 USD i want to have 22k 25k panel maybe next gen will support it",
  "Very wide experienced issue of sleep and wake issue of Moder standing",
  "Left side not TBT4 should be USB4 TBT3 Lenovo not print logo that is mean not did thunderbolt related certification i think",
  "No run down on specs How many jiggabytes of Raaaam",
  "Hello Brother Im in um a bit of difficult spot please help me out idk what to choose between Thinkpad e14 r5 7535HS 16gb 512gb or IdeaPad slim 5 gen 10 R5 7535hs 16gb 1tb storage Or IdeaPad slim 5 gen 10 r7 7735hs 16gb 512gb Thinkpad got 45 nstc while ideapad got 100 sRGB display is the only difference here Also i never had a laptop this one gonna be my first laptop And mostly i will do drafting and web browsing and in meantime im thinking bout learning graphics design The bove mentioned laptops are within my budget I cant extend my budget",
  "Can you play valorant with e14 gen 5 ryzen 5 7350U",
  "much much much much much",
  "What specs Is this the AMD Ryzen 7 7735U Processor",
  "ThinkPad E14 with Intel Core Ultra outperform Apples M3 chip easy",
  "this is much much much too much",

  "Have you updated the BIOS",
  "Good catch on the USB4 and Thunderbolt certification",
  "Probably should have run down on the specs I figured most of these entry to mid machines these days either come with 8 or 16 and benchmarking is becoming a little redundant But if you feel like I should put that back in the reviews Ill do it for you my friend",
  "ComputerStuff Id say do what appeals to the widest audience Most probably have no idea about chipsets bottlenecks benchmarks etc But I do miss the Raaam clip lol",
  "johndoelr9if WERE BRINGING IT BACK",
  "I have a soft spot for ThinkPads so thats what I would get",
  "I would choose the ThinkPad because of the ability to easily upgrade the RAM I have had the IdeaPad Slim for some years now it is almost perfect good screen battery speakers and CPU but for my use case 16 GBs gets eaten fast on Linux Ubuntu",
  "Maybe but not with good performance This laptop really isnt meant for gaming",
  "Yes our review unit was a Ryzen 7 Should have gone over specs in this video we normally do",
  "That is quite a claim",
  "wideasta whats the problem u can easly check it online",
  "Bravox84 the thinkpad E series does not have any high power ultra core Its all U which is power efficient and is weaker than a ryzen 5 5500 Even if they were high power laptop cpus they wouldnt outperform the M4 Max If you take the core 9 ultra 295K then maybe",
  "wideasta from m3 to m4 max Genius",
  "Bravox84 my bad even so the low power core ultra processors and even high power laptop processors arent shit",
  "wideasta Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 6 with Intel Core Ultra 7 155H and 32GB RAM more VRAM ist much more better than Apples M3",
  "Bravox84 M3 has better single core performance and WAY better power efficiency Core 7 has somewhat better multi core slightly better igpu And overall the M3 is better",
  "wideasta weaker then the 5500 Ok buddy sure",
  "I would lean towards the ThinkPad",
  "You forget one very important thing mate Im captain Jack Sparrow",
  "So what now Jack Sparrow Are we to be two immortals locked in an epic battle until Judgment Day and trumpets sound Hmm",
  "And I reeled you right in Thanks",
  "in many of my videos I actually recommend people pick up the AMD models of these ThinkPad laptops typically because they have better CPU offerings theyre just better battery life more power whatever the case is here this year is a little different because AMD is actually a previous generation CPU in this laptop whereas Intel using the current generation CPU in this laptop so I think that the Intel model is actually very compelling this year because youre getting a very very budget friendly ThinkPad here these are meant to be very budget friendly think pads however youre still getting a brand new recent chip in this laptop here youre not getting a previous generation of and thats what the noo does when it comes to you the E Series and L Series to keep the costs down part of it is what they do is they use previous generation CPUs which is fine I mean it keeps the cost down its not like a CPU becomes useless because its a year old however in this specific case they have decided to keep that CPU current generation this laptop so if youre looking for a very budget friendly but still very premium ThinkPad lets have a look at the e14 Intel model for 24 okay lets have a quick look at some of the offerings here well look at the psref document to get an idea so several different CPU options here we do have some high powerered variants H and some low powered variants U typically what youre seeing here is maybe even that the same number of cores or slightly differ in cores however typically youre going to be getting a different configuration for example so 125h you actually get four P cores and eight efficiency cores and two of these LP cores and then on the 125 U you get the same number of efficiency CES but you actually lose two of the performance cores so that potentially could make a big difference for you depending what youre looking for of course the threads are different there too 155h which is a very powerful CPU Im actually using that on the laptop to do the editing of this video and you get up to a 155 U 165 U there are some differences here you can see the U variants come with Intel Graphics the H variants come with Intel arc graphics so if you are going to be using the igpu here you definitely want to go with one of the H ones 125s its decent realistically and the 155h is a very capable Intel art Graphics its again on the laptop Im using right now same thats going to be in an MSI claw for example so this is going to be most capable CPU by far in general just in terms of raw performance six performance cores eight efficiency cores and you get better Intel art Graphics but theyre all going to be very capable overall some different screen options here here in Canada I dont think we have access to this 1400p well have to see but there are two 1200p 45 ntse 45 ntse nothing special realistic Im not a big fan of those screens big jump here 22k up to a little bit more resolution so you get slightly more pixel density that will be pretty nice realistically on a 14in laptop you get better contrast ratio and you also get 100 srgb so pretty big jump up there so depending on the cost added in Id probably recommend going for that 1400p uh 125h we dont even have the 155h here I guess in Canada realistically you can only go up to 155 U its good but the igpu is not going to be that performant uh but if you dont care not going to be a huge difference some different Ram configurations here again its not soldered or anything like that so you can add it yourself 32 GB uh thats pretty expensive so I mean I would recommend 32 on this laptop however you can certainly add it on your own storage 2242 size storage so thats again thats very expensive there realistically uh screen offerings here not a big fan of either of these realistically theyre okay for just like a general typing machine but I would recommend getting the better one if you get access to it realistically that 1400p screen looks pretty nice realistically it should be uh upgrade you would it should be an upgrade you should pursue if you can and then in terms of the CPU its really up to you if youre going to be doing any form of gaming on the laptop uh the 155 VI is is obviously going to be the 155h is obviously going to be a lot more capable okay lets have a look at the laptop here you can see theres some fingerprints on it Ive been using it actually for about an hour getting it set up you can see fingerprints uh but easy to wipe these things down you basically just take I dont know whatever any type of cloth you know give it a wipe down like that right not going to work give it a quick little so I actually know I like black the black of think pads from back in the day uh but nowadays I really wish there was more gray options realistically just specifically for fingerprints right uh its a pretty structurally sound laptop considering its one of the lower options from Lenovo its very sturdy realistically doesnt have any Flex whatsoever right its got a lot of plastic too but despite that this thing is very sturdy right feels good in the hand sharp edges right some think pads have rounded edges some have sharp edges this one is sharp all right very nice lets get the weight not going to be super heavy 1500 gr so so I dont know 32 33 lb somewhere around there not too bad realistically uh yeah intake on the bottom foot to raise it up pretty standard right same as the AMD version uh you can see here on the left side power in Thunderbolt ports you get Thunderbolt four port very nice usba HDMI microphone combo microphone headphone combo Jack speaker out there other side another usba and RJ45 ethernet and CT lot slot so two usba two USBC one of which is Thunderbolt and then you know just typical power out display out in that so thats nice looking pretty good inside as I said Ive turned it on already right typical ThinkPad design here modern style with the kickout for the camera which I prefer some people dont but I do actually prefer function control swapped kind of the traditional style where the function is on the outside you can go into Advantage here uh well disappear but little Advantage there or bios and swap that around no problem looking pretty nice here right fingerprint you get your power on there uh some of these have backl keyboards some do not right all your embedded keys there so lets actually open this up now have a look inside okay getting inside the laptop is usually pretty easy looks like this has washer style screws which I actually do prefer meaning they dont fall out when you take them out just a little bit of torque and you can go like that get that in there give it a Twist see that some to like that then you dont have to pull and you dont overextend it basically always go in the back on these and Ill show you why okay and just going around the front right this one actually doesnt have a hinge style clip so you can go all the way around with a guitar pick some of them have kind of hooks on the bottom so you dont want to you typically want to hinge like that this one doesnt have that so some structure in here for the ram pretty straightforward right metal bottom interestingly it actually is metal I thought it was plastic but it actually is a metal bottom to give it some extra structure so thats nice nice to got a little metal on it and theres a look inside the laptop so for a budget oper ring I mean these look pretty good considering their budget different battery options on this this one here is a one here is a 46 47 wat hour battery probably as big as you could get in this thing physically cuz the motherboard actually is pretty large realistically in this laptop the new upgraded ThinkPad speakers you can see that they are the rectangular Style higher wattage ones which they basically have all the think pads are upgraded this year which I love to see because think pads are premium supposed to be premium even the lowend even the lower cost ones like this here should at least have acceptable sound so I expect this to sound decent not you know be groundbreaking but it should be decent and decent should be a huge upgrade from last year realistically so thats nice there upgrade ability you do have dual nvme really nice 2242 one there 2280 I me fantastic upgradeable WiFi Fant fantastic and upgradeable Ram two kits of uh two sticks of ram there so I mean what more do you want out of a 14in laptop two storage devices two RAM and upgradeable WiFi good speakers as big as batteries you can possibly fit and a huge heat sink right I mean its not a gaming laptop its just got an APU nice thick heat pipe on there there right over the Apu there and one of these larger fans there should not produce too much turbulence or noise so this actually looks really nice inside really stickly okay well do a quick typing test here fire that up there uh function and control as I mentioned are swap there swap it in at Lov Advantage if you dont like that you can get backlit keyboards you can get it without backlit keyboards uh I mean usually like a 10 addon or something like that copilot button unfortunately uh you do get your uh function keys up here and you can also do function swap so that they turn back into you know volume up volume down kind of stuff right really nice uh typical of the modern think pads where its a lower profile key see that there slightly lower profile Keys like the physical keys arent super tall uh but tons of travel just like any ThinkPad right tons of travel lets do a quick typing test Im assuming its going to be very nice Ive reviewed the AMD version of this yeah its really nice very very nice ThinkPad keyboard one of the best keyboards youre going to get to type on I actually prefer kind of now the Lenovo Yoga the highend yogas and the legions but thinkpads are just slightly behind that theyre still fantastic realistically youre gonna its going to be a joy youre going to want to type on this and the nice thing is you can see theyre actually recessed down right so you can see that there theres actually a recess down from the chassis which allows the keys to be slightly higher up so theyre actually raised above slightly meaning more travel very nice trackpad is not big typical ThinkPad trackpad very smooth very precise soft click these are meant for you know business environments typically so not going to have a super sharp click of course you do have your track Point nib here left right scroll so when youre typing you can use this to navigate especially in text right use that and then what happens there is you dont have to remove your hand down here every single time youre typing so really really good for typists overall looking pretty good though okay lets have a look at the screen here so its nothing special on this model here 45 ntsc 60 HZ 120 uh 1 1200p 1200p its nothing special realistically there is actually a much better screen offering on this laptop uh its a 1400p so 22k give you a little bit more resolution which look nice right we can see right off the bat its got a little bit of a pinkish tone to it there um you know little bit orangey pink not a really bold red unfortunately because its only 45 ntsc uh blacks are good though in this room here especially right theres absolutely no bleed or anything like that so the blacks are good its not a bad panel in terms of quality its just that the color space is crushed a bit being a 45 ntsc so you know they do have that Higher One realistically come in here right not really that vibrant in terms of the colors its not bad its not a bad screen not a TN 220 TN or something but its a little muted here realistically uh for daytoday business work youre not going to care realistically its going to be fine even watching shows itll be fine but I would recommend if youre going to be using this for any type of content creation or you know as a really primary device in terms of consuming Med media I would recommend just splurging get that 22k screen uh youre going to get the same brightness but youre going to get 100 srgb and a better contrast ratio slightly better resolution so definitely worth it okay well check the audio here I do expect the audio to be okay it has those upgraded speakers these are typically undertuned you can use FX sound to increase the volume but because these are business laptops Applause Music Music Applause Music yeah its totally fine uh theyre not super loud I think they do that on purpose with these think pads that theyre not super super loud in a business setting easy to tune that download FX sound and youll get more sound but overall the speakers are clear sound good big improvement over last year C scores on performance mode uh were getting 93 71 not staggering by any means but again this is the 155 U not the 155h if you got the same laptop with the H variant you would probably get 13 14 even 15000 so it be much more performant but if you dont need that kind of power I mean 9371 still very good youll be able to even do 4K multiframe video editing no problem on this laptop with that kind of score and then when you throw it in silent mode it does drop down to about half of that 4535 more more than enough for just casual browsing you can see thats around 11th gen i7 so I mean definitely going to be more than enough for daytoday use even some fairly demanding stuff will be totally fine even on silent mode WiFi is okay on it I did this in my office area upstairs where I dont have the best reception so its getting okay reception realistically its pretty standard and then looking at battery life thats going to be one of the more strength of this laptop even with that relatively small battery its not going to have a giant battery like some laptops this lower wattage lower power variant of this Intel Core chip is just going to sip on power so here and were burning around 68 Watts so thats good for probably six or even seven hours of just kind of hanging out again and then did some 108p YouTube at 60fps and not a huge jump few more watts being burned around eight or so so thats still going to be good for about 6 hours so youre looking at about 6 hours of YouTube watching on this laptop and then the Envy me thats it do actually very high very high nvme here uh this is a Samsung I believe its a Samsung 980 Pro OEM variant here they put these in a lot of these laptops so its actually very quick here very good if youre using it for any type of video editing or anything like that as a look at the builtin webcam its nighttime not too much lighting my office but decent enough and its doing an okay job a little bit of a more challenging scene Hing rate is actually really good realistically uh so Id say its a decent webcam especially for such a budget offering its definitely fine depending on which model of CPU you get in this you are going to get different igpus this one here is the 155 U so its not going to have the Intel art Graphics still decently capable youre going to be able to play some different games here some semi demanding games things that arent going to be you know super demanding AAA titles will run just fine anything thats older will run very well this some some sparking zero here if you got the 155h with the Intel cor Graphics though then you get very outstanding performance similar to what you get on something like an MSI claw so I guess the takeaway for this laptop is if youre looking for a very high quality but more budget friendly offering of the ThinkPad lineup this is a really nice laptop I would highly recommend getting the better screen the 22k if you can overall these are pretty nice laptops and theyre definitely a lot more budget friendly I am liking the Intel model this year more than the AMD model just because it does have access to those 155h processor which I would highly recommend if you can but these U variant are still pretty good if you need to focus on battery life in a think pad",
  "Love to see you revisit every lineups in ThinkPad every year to keep us updated Nice review",

  "Would love to see your review of the E14 Gen 7 This time it has more battery capacity and the option for a 120 Hz display",
  "Is it possible to charge it with Power Bank via the USB port This can be useful in long meeting",
  "Amazing review as usual I has the AMD variant with 7735u and maxed up by myself to 16 already included plus 32gb of Ram plus 512 SSD but added additional 2tb in the SSD empty slot and is incredible amazing Installed Linux Mint 22 since day 1 and so far so great Temps are great fan is usually offdeactivated when web browsing and office work and even can do a little bit of Gaming on it For example Spider Man remastered at 1080p with FSR and Frame generation got 60fps constantly running with Steam and Proton in Linux Mint Ubuntu The only real downsize of the laptop is the screen which is OKish if you use mainly this laptop but as soon as you compare with any other laptop like macbook air or yoga 7 or dell xps it feels like Lenovo should had enable the upgrad option to 22k globally",
  "thank you for the video added to cart and now when I noticed the keyboard they shortened the enter or return key length which is quite disturbing I will not be buying it",
  "Can i update the 47Wh variant with a 57wh compatible battery",
  "Does the hinges wear out and snap after a while on these models Ive had my last 2 laptop hinges break on me from regular use after about 2 years",
  "Hello so I am thinking of buying either this one or the thinkbook 16 g7 which one is better",
  "man i love this channel",
  "absolutely its important to look at how these things evolve over time especially when sometimes people might be picking these up a year or two later",
  "These old Thinkpads have the better keyboards but worse displays than modern ones Some have two batteries of which one is swappable",
  "you should see how many times I say um or ahhh i edit them out but i miss them a lot",

  "This is more upgradeable than all their other series for 2024",
  "Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 4 2023",
  "Ah yes my boi beau is back at it love watching your reviews mate",
  "57w upgradeable not 47",
  "155H cpu with ARC gpu is the best option for the price till date in this entry level thinkpad",
  "In Europe the upgrades for memory and storage are much cheaper And you have always the option of another OS besides Windows like Ubuntu or no OS for 60120 less",
  "Is it better than a Thinkpad l14 gen 5",
  "2 questions Can you charge from both USB ports Is it 4g lte",

  "I have some problem I cant manage wifi connections the wifi icon is missing in network and internet in windows 11 There is only bluetooth and airplane mode All Lenovo drivers installed How to enable wifi in the windows settings",
  "The E series is super weird in the context of what T and P series offers within Lenovos 14 models In my opinion they should do the dual SSD thing in both T and P series Up until 2020 theres a functionality in the WWAN slot where you can put BM key SSD into it and install system on it while having 2nd drive for storage This is super useful feature to me and many other people Lenovo should either do 2x2242 slot across all their 14 machines or remove BIOS whitelist for WWAN slot SSD just a little PSA for you here",
  "Thank you so much for adding a buying link for India",
  "Even its a previous generation Id go with AMD for three reasons a lot cheaper better GPUs for the price and they are still capable chips",
  "Shame on them for soldering the wifi card on all their other series",
  "Ye man why the f is the e14 g6 more uprgadable than the 910 ifixit score t14 g5 its a joke lol xd expect the keyboard e14 g6 is just more superior in repairability its a joke Im thinking about getting a e14 g6 becouse without OS and 16gb ram 500 gb ssd its almost as cheap as a used older T model Lenovo the f u doing",
  "Good review There is a 57wh battery option in Asia Ultra 5 125h with Arc graphics would be a good option to get",
  "If Im correct t14 gen 5 has no upgradable wifi but e14 does Why tho O ofc t14 keyboard replacement is easier but still why would they do this Correct me if im wrong please",
  "Ended up going with AMD Ryzen 7 which was on sale for CAD 1290 Love your reviews sir Considering you are a few Canadians out there reviewing this stuff I love it even more",

  "I have in front of me here the brand new ThinkPad e14 this is the AMD model all new for 2023 uh kind of all new for 2023 this one here comes with a 7 000 branded AMD processor its the 7530u which is actually just a rebranding of the 5000 series so in this case its a 55 or 5600u but its labeled for you know the newer labeling scheme that they have but its still a very very capable lineup this model here you can get with the ryzen 3 you can get a ryzen 5 which I have here or the ryzen 7 so the 7730u I actually expect this out from Lenovo for a very good price actually it was about 500 Canadian dollars which is probably around 400 or 380 American so very very cheap but I went with kind of the mixed range so I upped the processor to the ryzen 5 7730u over the ryzen 3 because I think thats a pretty big jump the rise the jump to the ryzen 7 is actually pretty considerable youre looking at about 200 to 300 Canadian dollars I think it was 230 specifically I dont know if thats really worth it because this is a hyper budget laptop despite the fact its very good quality so a lot of the enticing part of this laptop is that its very low cost but its still a ThinkPad and has pretty respectable specs so I deck this out here which is eight gigabytes of RAM which is soldered to the motherboard however it does have a slot I just popped in another eight gigabyte stick and now I have 16 gigabytes of RAM you could put in a 16 gigabyte and get 24 if you need that but its nice that you can upgrade it its not just all soldered its half half so thats a nice little bit Advantage here you can keep your specs low on the Lenovo website save yourself some money go locally or on Amazon or wherever you shop and get yourself some RAM for dirt cheap this one here has the lowest nvme that it also comes with too so it only has 256 gigabytes of nvme storage its a two two four two so its a slightly smaller form factor however it has a second slot it has a 2280 slot inside anyway so why pay Lenovo the extra amount to get that storage when you can do it yourself the screen is nothing crazy on this its a 1200p screen so its 16x10 you get a little bit more height on it which I prefer over a 1080p screen the 1200p is a little bit better nothing its not a bad screen its not a great screen its 300 nits so its bright enough especially for a business machine often if you spec out these Business Machines they have really low brightness on their screens like 220 nits and even that is kind of a stretch sometimes theyre like legitimately dim indoors its got a 45 ntsc screen its okay but again its a business laptop and this is a true ThinkPad so I went with the silver option just to kind of change it up because I always go with the black versions here and I just Ive actually never had a silver ThinkPad so I got that there its all metal chassis you know really really well designed obviously its a think pad theyre basically just no BS the laptops look good they perform well typing experience is superb obviously its a think pad so the typing experience is very very good you get your trackpad which is going to be quite nice and you get the track Point nib you could get out there and get yourself a Chromebook or some low end business machine or something like that with a lot of compromise or you know a school notebook which are typically just garbage I think this is a very compelling buy for a lot of people charger is just one of these tiny little uh 65 watt Lenovo Chargers USBC these are getting smaller and smaller every time normally think pads are black but sometimes they come in silver I guess so theres the laptop there so its your typical ThinkPad metal top there metal bottle bottom you can spec it out with a plastic bottom or ABS or whatever they call it um I dont know why you do that you use a tiny little bit of weight and I think the price difference is there is no price difference so its basically just weight um its weird because it has that black accent there that would be long more on a the black thing Pad but uh so its form factor you know its not the thickest not the thinnest think pads its a traditional ThinkPad same as like you know the T Series um so you can get like the carbon and the X the X1 and the X1 Carbon over there and a little bit thinner this is not as thin but you know you get your USB a on this side a full ethernet port which is kind of neat two USBC on this side and a usba so youre getting two USBC two usba this one doubles as power HDMI HDMI and headphone microphone combo Jack so you actually get a decent Port selection despite the fact that its a pretty thin laptop I mean its 14 inch so but you know its a business style laptop so theyre obviously going to add some ports to it wow that was not easy to get into I had to pull it off camera that was the hardest to get anythingpad ever I was just worried about breaking it anyways so the bottom is metal um get your grill there bent on that side vent cover on there so you dont get dust a little bit of a heat sink thatll sit over top of the ram just a little bit to take the heat off these are just support brackets and then that sits on the nvme so thats pretty standard uh good well built and thats a look at the actual device there pretty good nice big fan there uh youll actually move quite a bit of air but thats a pretty nice size fan there um nice dense blade nice dense blades there dual heat pipes so not single heat pipe also a plus obviously some of these use you know Cheapo single heat pipes monitor connector uh so you get this one shipped with a two two four two nvme Drive which you see there so one storage and an upgradable slot there so you can put in a second nvme drive very easy to upgrades youre typically going to leave that for your operating system theres no point in switching that out and then use this as your second drive you could switch this out but I mean honestly just leave it and then you put your second Drive in there a decent sized battery here so you can spec this out with two different batteries this is the 57 watt hour I chose this as an upgrade the smaller one that comes with it I think is 43 or 42 Watt hours which again will be fine but you might as well get the 52 57 Watt hours this will actually give it good battery life to be honest on these AMD chips specifically um so thats theyre the tiny little speakers there nothing special theyll produce sound basically upgradable WiFi so that is good there and then the ram so lets uh take out power here okay power is disconnected so now Im going to have a look at the ram and there you go so you can see here you get a soldered Ram one two three four so you get two four six eight gigabytes soldered onto the board you can have Lenovo put in a sodium stick for you but why would you do that its so cheap so theyll do it and theyll charge you a fortune but you can do it yourself so I have boatloads of ram over here arent sure what I have but Ill pop one in right now an eight Nate so you could put in um youre like eight because theres eight solder on the board if you pop in an eight gigabyte stick then youre gonna have eight plus eight sixteen so you have 16 in gigabyte youll have 16 gigabytes in dual Channel which is perfect you could put a larger you could put it in a 16 gigabyte stick so youll have 16 plus 8 which will give you 24 gigabytes and then 16 of that and were going to run in a dual Channel and the rest will run in single Channel it wont make a big difference but Im just gonna go with eight so now I have eight gigabytes installed eight total eight gigabits installed 16 total and uh thats upgraded uh no idea just things just show up sometimes I pull them from things here and there okay now have a look at the trackpad and the keyboard here so I mean its your standard ThinkPad layout so if youve used the ThinkPad in the past its the same layout you know physical function keys up there you have also your alternative control so if you hit the function button and hit that now its you know going to be the actual function keys and then if you hit that turn it off then you can use it like the alternative buttons there you know volume volume up brightness that kind of stuff so good uh function and control switch there which can be annoying to some people but thats think pads for you now it is a ThinkPad keyboard however the actual physical keycaps are slightly smaller so if you get like a T14 or you know an older ThinkPad from back in the day lets just say the keycaps are that big on this one the keycaps are that big so the physical keycaps on the actual laptop are low profile you can see there um they still have tons of travel so if we come in here and you know we open up like notepad or something like that um you know theres still tons of travel on the keeps themselves so you get you know you can see there Im getting a lot of travel right so so when youre actually typing its fine like um you can see Im making some errors there because Im not quite used to the low profile youd get used to it you know after a short period of time its still going to be better than I dont know like a magic keyboard from um Apple which are nice keyboards Ill admit they are very nice keyboards these are better but then you have your trackpad the trackpad is hyper accurate because its Lenovo Lenovo makes amazing track pads they always do its nothing new their trackpads are very accurate you feel very confident when you use them the click is satisfying enough thats right lets track that then you get this which is the track point you get the typical nib or track point which is what its actually called and you know you can use this as your mouse if youve used it youve used it uh you know you can move things around so then you know you come in here and if youre wanting to use this so you can use the left click as a left click obviously uh you know thats your left click there you have your right click and then you have your scroll so you can use that to scroll up and down so you dont you know you can use two finger gestures its faster if Im navigating and not typing at all ever I just use the trackpad because its very easy to navigate you know you can left right up down whatever in smooth but if Im typing like lets say you know Im typing a document here document and then I have an issue you know if Im typing it especially for a touch typist um our touch typist then you know if youre using the trackpad you have to remove your hands down to the trackpad navigate to where you went and then reset your typing position if you use the track Point neb you know youre going to be basically set up on like this and youre going to be typing as a track as a touch typist types and then you can just move like that right and you can leave all of your fingers you know on the right spot you just move this finger the index finger to where you want to go Music its actually pretty loud thats only 60 Im going to turn it up you have headphones youre going to turn it down my phone might stabilize it anyways Music its actually kind of hurting my ears Music Im actually kind of impressed uh theres no bass like at all theres like zero bass um which is fine its not for that but for you know watching shows um you know YouTube content and meetings and that kind of stuff um listening to some just you know generic music whatever its gonna be fine its actually it sounds better than I anticipated themselves in because we have reached it the Peace Day resistance the magnum opus concern childrens advertisers ladies and gentlemen I present to you its night time okay so it sounds amazing um for spoken kind of stuff it sounds great so youre watching YouTube videos uh you know conferences it sounds perfect no issues whatsoever with that but you can see there theres no Bloom whatsoever uh thats nice nice even blacks yeah like the colors are bright lots of saturation but theyre not right these arent the right colors um it doesnt have good you know dcip srgb coverage I think its 45 um its just you know not a color or Super Color accurate screen so youre not going to want to use this with professional video editing work or photo editing if colors matter but you know if youre a programmer a business person youre not going to care this is still a nice orange color a little weird on my screen looks a little more orange than it is um but uh the blues are nice like look thats a thats a very good blue nice and accurate the greens look good Ive watched this video so many times on like good screens and bad screens the yellows typically look okay nothing wrong with that its always the Reds the Reds always look like crap they look like orange it looks worse in person so thats the only issue here otherwise its a good screen okay now Im gonna do a cinebench R23 test Ill put the results up on the screen after but what I want to show here is temperatures and specifically noise that have a noise meter so well test my ambient here so about 34 and uh lets get it started yeah so I mean I literally cant hear the fans uh its its in performance yeah so very very quiet I mean were looking at 37 DB thats incredibly quiet um its not a Hot Chip for to start with I mean its the 75 30 U is is not allowed not a hot CPU by any means you can see here like were not thermal throttling at all the cooling solution is more than enough dual heat pipe on the cooling solution with a nice big fan dense fan blades I mean were not throttling were not even getting warnings here s a look at the cinebench R23 scores you can see here that the CPU is getting a score of 8 500 or so on multicore and 1450 on single core so its actually pretty good considering this is a couple Generations old chip so its going to be very capable for productivity coding programming every daytoday task you can pretty much throw at it and you can see here though the temperatures are actually quite good even when running cinebench R23 we didnt have any warnings or thermal throttling whatsoever so its a pretty cool chip overall and the cooling solution with that dual ppipe and pretty good fans is obviously keeping it nice and cool the included nvme is nothing special you can see here you know its not the fastest nvme you can get its just a two two four two uh gen 3 drive basically but again youre probably using this for your operating system and then you can basically throw in whatever drive you want in that 2280 and thats what I did you can see the battery life here is quite excellent so in the first one here were on idle were at 100 brightness I didnt test it at low brightness so just 100 brightness on uh you know better battery mode not battery saver anything like that and were getting 10 hours on idle and you can see here how low these draw is 56 on the Watts on the draw so even at 100 brightness were going to get youre going to get many many hours of battery life here and then I loaded up some 1080p YouTube so 1080p 60 YouTube and you can see here that it did drop down but were still getting about seven hours of YouTube playback and power consumption only jumped up to about uh negative 082 so were actually getting many hours of use here so this is easily going to be an allday laptop okay and heres a look at the builtin webcam thats kind of a ghostly I look like so pale my white balls are basically the same color as me so lacks any saturation but uh it actually seems to be relatively High refresh rate which is weird because the tire refresh rate but it has like no saturation I guess you could tweak that thats a glow light in front of me and its a very yellow color you can see and go cold and warm and even with that like I look like Im Ill or something so it doesnt have any saturation its very very desaturated but its a good webcam nonetheless in terms of looks like it has high refresh rate well see how the mic sounds so whats my Takeaway on this laptop Ive been using it for a couple days now I mean its a ThinkPad so I mean if youve used a ThinkPad youre going to know what youre expecting here theres a reason the think pads are legendary uh theyre good laptops the build quality is very good and typically the range of value on a ThinkPad can range from very good like this or kind of bad depending on what youre expecting it out with and where youre buying it and that there this is a very low cost ThinkPad but a very good ThinkPad despite that you know theres no compromises you know it has the same keyboard as most of the other thing pads youre going to get out there trackpad exactly the same you know track Point all that screen is fine 1200 1200p screen its not going to be a professional photo editing type laptop you know it doesnt have the best colors in the world but the colors are fine overall theres nothing wrong with this laptop it has good keyboard good trackpad very good build quality good screen good enough speakers great battery life I mean overall and super low cost so I mean overall I mean its its kind of a nobrainer when it comes to which ThinkPad youre going to buy this year from what Im seeing I mean theres the X Series which are their own thing then you have the e16 which I reviewed previously and the e14 which I think for most people are actually the way to go because theyre actually very low cost but theyre basically the same as like the TSeries you get dual you get upgradable storage with two slots you get upgradable and you get upgradeable memory as well with an extra slot in there and overall theres nothing wrong with the laptop its totally fine so I mean for 500 Canadian dollars or like around 380 to 400 USD I mean what else youre gonna buy like I cant even think of a single laptop that would give you this type of specifications and really you know theres no compromises at this kind of value",

  "Observation on the Ryzen 7 Model in India Although it has more cores and almost double the gaming FPS performance it is about 28K INR more in price which is 50 jump At that point we reach base level gaming machines or ultraportables and not worth the price Unless you are a ThinkPad fan like me",
  "Thanks for the video I am not able to find any Thinkpad laptop for CAD 500 The very base E series now starts at CAD 800 and by the time that a 16 gb ram 512gb storage added the price passes 1000",
  "The reds look orange because you have to remove some yellow in the calibration app and make a good icc profile",
  "I dont ask for much in a laptop but a numeric keypad is essential so it will have to be the 16 inch for me",
  "Hey mate loved the review Youve earned a sub from me Im on a similar budget and team red all the way would you suggest me to go for a 5800hs laptop or a 7730u laptop without any dgpu My usecase for this is coding in college and some light media consumption Id be having a gaming pc at home The 5800hs laptop in mind is a vivobook 16x Also is there a newer alternative which youd recommend or this is the best in that 500 price range Thanks",
  "I will never buy a laptop with soldered RAM But its great video Thank you for sharing",
  "I bought this laptop with battery upgrade ryzen 7 apu 1tb ssd comes as default with ryzen 7 upgrade aluminium frame fingerprint reader and backlitkeyboard all for 640 euros Worse config is plus 1000 euros in my country if not bought directly from lenovo Only thing im kinda concerned about is that did I get a good deal if they release versions with the new 4nm zen chips",
  "Can you install a Linux distro and do a review",
  "Do you need to hold the keyboard when opening the lid for this model",
  "why does the e14 come with only 1 year warranty and t14 and p14 have 3 years warranty Is e14 built good",
  "Thank you for your review its very useful Im planning to replace my yoga slim 7 4500U8GB with this E14 since it sounds like even though its supposed to be budget model it doesnt lack a lot compared to the T14S i51345u and other more expensive models I was considering initially plus Im not a big fan of intel cpus on laptops either and sadly most models available here are intelbased Unfortunately 6 cores is not enough for my current software development activities so Im wondering if the 7530u is actually an upgrade 12 threads compared to 6 or I should just go with the 7730u Its about 95 CAD more expensive here which I dont mind investing but Im also wondering if the single fan is enough to cool it Should I be worried about any kind of throttling And more importantly does the letter i on the cover still light up",
  "Thanks for your review Just a note perhaps you might not want to show displays showing SAMSUNG on your display multiple times unless its the same people that own the 2 companies Best wishes",
  "Good value laptop but I hate that lip on the bezel with the webcam",
  "Once you go ThinkPad you never go back Then suddenly all the nonLenovo keyboards are the wrong layout",
  "TechGuyBeau Sir can you please make video on Asus vivobook S14 intel evo h series i5 12500H nonoled model and how does it fare against this thinkPad Both available at same price here in India PS if video not possible you can just give me your recommendation",
  "Robin I dont have access to that model however in terms of Ross CPU performance the 12500 H should perform better",
  "Im glad it was useful",
  "I am in the same dilemma I can get the 7530u model offline for 50k But then i can also get the 3050 12450h ideapad gaming 3 for 63k or so Although i have a gaming pc with 5600x and rx 6600 thus i can get away with the e14 But still this one is a pretty expensive one and the price gap isnt too much Also i can buy 3 years extended warranty and 3 years adp for just 3k with ideapad But no such options are there for the thinkpad Cant even extend its warranty What to do in this case",
  "LiegeMaximo I was in the same dilemma as you joined uni recently and was confused between a gaming laptop or normal one and I have a Ryzen 5 PC with 6700xt so I decided to get a normal laptop because its gonna last 68h as opposed to like 23h on gaming laptop and its also gonna be much lighter to carry around campus Although the price gap is not too much youll be spending more money for less practicality Carrying a gaming laptop everyday will be a PAIN",
  "samikadhikari6413 is it a metal build or plastic ABS There are two variants",
  "hyperterminalreborn i actually have owned a pavilion and thus am completely fine with carrying one around heh 23 kgs in my hands in an alright weight Yeah battery life is there but then i will usually work in library and there i have ports at every desk and cabin Should i get the ideapad gaming 3 with 5800h and 3050 It can be available for 55k in sale",
  "hyperterminalreborn btw which laptop did you buy",
  "LiegeMaximo lol the timing wtf gonna go to an offline store in like five minutes to buy Acer Swift 3 better than Vivobook S14 1080p",
  "Hey i had one question Can it run older games like GTA 5 Watch dogs battlefield 1 smoothly I just want to do light gaming this is my only concern otherwise I am in for this laptop",
  "Dont want to do the updates through Lenovo itself Because they often charge a lot for them Only do it if its cheaper than doing it herself As for the laptop they go on sale quite a bit so you need to just keep checking",
  "Half soldered half sodimm fyi",
  "In my country it is one of the few good laptops that allow 1 RAM slot 1 SSD slot to be upgradeable",
  "samikadhikari6413 nice Hopefully the price is good there The laptop is good overall for the price I paid",
  "TechGuyBeau yes about 58k INR or 700 USD launch price latest gen processor This is amazing considering the govt recently increased taxes on laptops and prices for even basic laptops have been on the higher since 2021 even after discounts Older gens of E14 are actually more expensive here",
  "With that confiq I must pay 1023 lenovo Where did you get it from",
  "The cooling on the laptop will be adequate for both the ryzen 5 and 7 The 7 is a performance uplift for your workflow so it might be worth the investment The 7730u will outperform a 1345u in real world tasks",
  "TechGuyBeau 1102 1152 you were speaking about colours and playing a Samsung demo I just thought that it didnt look great esp since you may get sponsored by companies you speak about forgive me if Im wrong Best wishes",
  "usergg3qh4di9s oh Im not sponsored by anyone let alone Samsung but the demo is very useful and Ive been using it for so long I know exactly how to interpret it Once you find a tool that works it is quite useful when comparing one screen to another Or one speaker to another Etc",
  "TechGuyBeau No prob",
  "Great video Would you recommend this laptop for someone who needs to work with large datasets in excel",
  "Is this still a good buy Found one at a decent price",
  "looks more like a thinkbook than a thinkpad",
  "TechGuyBeau you mentioned it was hard to get into base cover Any tips for first timers",
  "I am trying to buy this but it is significantly more expensive now 700USD",
  "Which one you prefer E14 or e16",
  "Was this on sale Went to Lenovo Canada and the starting price for E14 AMD is 1080 canadian",
  "there is now 2240x1400 ips screen option for 80 euros would you recommend buying it",
  "can you give some update about the battery life typically how long it will last for daily use coding browsing etc",
  "Is this the graphite grey colour version",
  "Hi Im considering buying one of these ThinkPad E14 Gen 6 Intel or ThinkPad E16 Gen 2 Intel Ill be using the laptop for basic stuff Excel internet video etc I want a good typing experience Ive used E14 in the past and have been very satisfied with its keyboard layout Dont know how typing on a 16 inch E series feels like because of the number pad Which of the two offers a better typing experience Overall which one do you recommend",
  "Im looking into buying a laptop for school and the E14 seems pretty convincing From what I can gather this should also be able to handle some comfy indieretro gaming on my train commute right Either way thanks for the review",
  "How do you unplug the battery You skipped through the process on your video you should have showed that part",
  "Should I spend an extra 300 to get the t14 Gen 4 instead of the e14 Gen 5 The main differences are that the t14 has better color quality 100 sRGB vs 45 NTSC more storage 1TB vs 500GB and is lighter 13kg vs 16kg Is the extra cost worth it for these differences",
  "hello i really hoping that you could see and leave a reply im looking for a new secondhand laptop for my work after been using t450 since its first release my university time and now im graduated and kinda looking for a replacement i found an e14 with 11th gen i5 for just 294 usd and i wanna ask for your opinion of this whether or not it is a bargain for a beginner engineering laptop or not or should i just opt for the amd version of it thank you",
  "what do you think about the intel version why did you choose amd",
  "If you will use linux dont buy it Black screen after suspended mode on ubuntu went for warranty and came back with the same problem Reseting drivers and BIOS doesnt work too beeps the code 0288 which is a computer display error Trying to get a refund it seems to be a common issue with these Lenovos and as far as I know happens in the previous gens too",
  "Can we do light gaming on it",
  "Sure it will be fine for that",
  "Just take a plastic guitar pick thing Find a corner to slide it into and slowly work your way around Until all the clips release You need to be firm but controlled You wont damaged any internals but you could break off a clip No the end of the world as is screws on anyways",
  "TechGuyBeau thanks and which SSD to use for upgrade I am considering crucial 16gb ram as an upgrade",
  "872nishant did you find SSD",
  "Are you buying in the USA You can probably get some coupons and such if so Try using edge browser I find it auto populates coupons",
  "TechGuyBeau Coupons are applied already You cannot get this laptop for the price you mentioned unless there is a sales promotion going on Kinda important to mention that I think Gen 6 is around the corner anyway",
  "Yes it was Just wait a sale will come back",
  "For basic use you will get 57 hours Depends how bloated windows is",
  "For sure I can play diablo 4 on it Thats about the max it can handle",
  "TechGuyBeau Gotcha thats more than enough then Thanks",
  "TechGuyBeau Sorry one more thing Im trying to decide between these two CPUs for my laptop Intel Core i51335U and AMD Ryzen 7 7730U The benchmarks are very similar and so is the price Integrated graphicswise AMD seems to have an edge so thats what Im leaning towards The only thing putting me off is that Ive been told AMD CPUs can have some issues with overheating Do you have a recommendation and have you experienced any overheating firsthand",
  "aBlackMage backwards Amd will run cooler if anything Typically and runs cooler and with better battery life If the benchmarks seem similar get amd in this model",
  "TechGuyBeau Mustve just been uninformed hearsay then Ill go for AMD thanks a lot",
  "aBlackMage haha indeed Typically intel performs a touch faster in benchmarks but amd runs cooler and has better battery and iGPU Both good Quite different",
  "Whats the cpu difference",
  "TechGuyBeau e14 has AMD Ryzen 5 7530U and the T14 has i51335U",
  "Leorm4qq nah thats too much Unless colour accurate is critical 300 euro is a LOT of money Get the e14 in my opinion",
  "Amd has better battery life and iGPU And typically better performance per watt And costs less Im not a fan of intel laptop CPUs",
  "thank you for your answer TechGuyBeau",
  "TechGuyBeau i3 1315u is better in benchmarks",
  "Mine is running just fine on Fedora 39 No problems",
  "Software cannot damage hardware",
  "jarod3371 It technically can but only in very specific circumstances Installing a Linux distro isnt one of them however",
  "Fedora 39 works great on ThinkPad E16 Gen 1 However the fingerprint reader is not in the Linux kernel so skip that",
  "Just got one yesterday and im running Debian 12 stable on it and it work just fine Pretty fast on gaming as well I recommend for lots of people Plus this video was awsome i love how he opened it so we can see the hardware",

  "this is the laptop we use at school",
  "Gotta say to me the speakers are at best mediocre worse than many cheap tablet speakers from the same Lenovo Maybe thats because Im on linux mint and it isnt that well supported With anything else I didnt really see any issues yet Compact fast decent battery and great keyboard My modification is Ryzen 7730u 16512 and 47 wh battery Unfortunately couldnt find one with 57 wh for a good prize",
  "Can you put it on a scale and tell us how much it weights",
  "what is the form factor of the additional memory you put in",

  "I do uber eats for working and learning cyber security on my free time Im looking for a laptop that have a long battery that i can be using on my car practicing some labs and also that does not lose performance while is not plugged in also i will keep windows and download virtual box to run with kali linux can this laptop be an opportunity",

  "Hey it uses ddr4 for sodimm memory I have some on my Amazon storefront that I used in this laptop The links to those are in my bio if curious I dont youtube will let me share an actual link in the comments",
  "I prefer AMD laptops especially where battery is concern Intel is making good changes with the core ultra but thats not on the eseries thinkpads yet Size is your call If you travel a lot 14 If not 16 is great",
  "Depends on your task Overall pretty good",
  "With a 4090 it should last many years yes I dont know how long but many",

  "Lenovo has almost random sales and coupons Get a coupon app as it helps a lot with trying them",
  "TechGuyBeau Yes I know but they allow only one coupon Are you sure you paid 500 CAD even with coupons cant get it to less then 780",

  "How much is the thinkpad and the Thinkbook in your region and what are the specs",

  "Id recommend the 2024 model The CPU is much more capable",
  "TechGuyBeau I was looking for the Lenovo ideapad 1i i think 16gb RAM 512gb ssd intel core i7 Is it good I think that the only problem is that the screen is just HD not Full HD and its 60hz not 120hz",
  "No Id aim for at least a 680m iGPU 7740hs or 7735hs processors are baseline for you",
  "TechGuyBeau you have any thin and light laptop recommendations for this price range for my needs Cuz I dont want to carry around heavy gaming machines",
  "Dual channel only applies to a matching pair So lets say 8gb on the board and you added 8 All 16 is dual Lets say you added 16 then 88 run dual channel The additional 8gb runs single",

  "I am thinking either E14 Gen5 or T14 Gen1 Anyone in the comments to point me in the right direction Both are availible right now for around 1000 where I live so id consider that the budget Is there any other laptops I may have overlooked that would be a better deal",
  "How to turn on keyboard backlight",

  "gopikrishnanganesan6691 youll get at least 1000mbps speeds on a 10gb enclosure Totally legit If this laptop has thunderbolt 4 then you can get up to 3000 Mbps on a 40gbps enclosure",
  "what about the lenovo slim 7 pro with 3050 6gb and 7840hs how much is that",
  "TechGuyBeau Sadly cant seem to find it in stores Closest to that one in terms of specs is the 6800HS RTX3050 sold by private sellers Price is between 16001800 euros which is around 16501900",
  "You need to make sure that the model you bought has keyboard backlight If it does you hit function and spacebar",
