  "after using literally the same design for nearly a century Im sure this new 2023 Lenovo IdeaPad 3i has a all new design cant wait to see it oh no no no please be a different design please be a different design please you just had one jobs Noble you just had to change the design whats this theres something in here fair enough I suppose foreign if it aint broke dont fix it quite literally as they have not changed the physical appearance of the IdeaPad 3 Series for quite some time now the good news here is that they have refreshed it with the latest internals and so this model right here is rocking Intels 13th generation 1350 new series I3 chip with 6 physical cores we also have a 512 gigabyte solid state drive to my surprise we have LP ddr5 memory with 8 gigabytes total over here we also have Intels UHD Graphics furthermore we have WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5 on board and finally this is a 15 inch full AC display and it comes with Windows 11 now while not a whole lot has changed on the surface there are a number of notable changes on the inside and a few physical ones as well at that so were gonna go through all those in full detail and give you guys all all the information you need lets get started in terms of packaging content you can expect a very primitive cardboard box here with the basic Lenovo branding but again its a budget series laptop now inside behind a ton of protective packaging you will of course find the Lenovo IdeaPad 3i itself its a price surprise it looks very familiar to previous models past that you do have a 65 watt charging adapter and it is worth noting unfortunately you do not get USBC charging out of the box even with the latest 2023 variant you also have the wall outlet charging cable piece and then finally you have the documentation now at first glance the IdeaPad 3i really has not changed all that much like I mentioned everything from the straight linear edges to its Conservative Business Like design all remain very much the same they even offer the same Abyss blue color we saw with the previous generation however technically speaking this laptop is 10 percent Slimmer than the previous iteration a change again you can really only notice if you keep the old one next to it now with that said this laptop does have a full plastic build from top to bottom so you wont get any premium feeling or looking elements however it does have a modest weight of 352 pounds making it light enough for a 15 inch laptop to carry around starting with the top side like I mentioned you have a Simple and Clean textureless plastic finishing over here it doesnt feel cheap or finicky but its nothing really to glance at either though that Abyss blue color does have a nice unique touch to it and then of course you have some basic Lenovo branding on the sides of this laptop is where you will find all the i o Port diversity so on one side you have the DC charging port you have a USB a super speed Port you do have a rather dated HDMI 14 port a very primitive USBC gen 1 Port a headphone jack now on the other side one more usba Super Speed port and to my surprise you have a fullsize SD card reader which is always a welcome addition but as you can see that poor diversity hasnt really improved all that much but I suppose for a laptop of this caliber its fair enough the bottom side of the laptop also has a plastic finish like the rest of the body you will notice you have a nice long linear air intake vent though its worth noting that you only have one cooling fan so a lot of it is just for I guess dramatic effect but aside from that theres really not a whole lot more to see at the bottom aside from rubber grips to keep the laptop in place upon unfolding the laptop you will find a decent sized amount of palm rest space and of course its a full plastic inner chassis though its worth noting that Abyss blue color gives it a far more premium feel than there actually is now you have a surprisingly smaller trackpad than you would otherwise find on most 15inch laptops but thats not really a problem here because this is such a nice trackpad otherwise despite having a plastic surface finish you have super tactile clicks youll also find theres a very very limited amount of flex over here which surprised me honestly and the clicks are really well calibrated and tuned this is exactly what a nice track patch should be like even if it doesnt use fancy materials like a glass surface so I Gotta Give Lenovo full Kudos on that keyboards have always been my favorite thing about Lenovo laptops and this one right here is just as good as any other Lenovo machine out there if not better so you still have those super well labeled keycaps with a reasonable amount of surface area per keycap theyve also slightly improved the orientation of the keyboard to make it a little bit more user friendly you still have a full size 10 key number pad over here and the power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner Additionally you will also notice that this year to my surprise they actually include standard backlighting even in this base I3 configuration a feature that was previously only reserved for the I5 and i7 configurations thank you Lenovo for taking that feedback now on top of that of course the typing experience remains just as good as ever you have a generous amount of key travel every keystroke feels tactile yet firm and it makes for a great typing experience as you might have expected directly above the keyboard you will find a top firing speaker Grill and yes we will do a full sound test later on in the video now the hinge quality here is okay so you do have a decent amount of screen wobble and while you do get a full 180 degree tilt its worth noting that you want to be careful with the hinge as using it recklessly will undoubtedly result in longterm wear and tear damage display fitting is okay as well so you have a reasonably thin enough chin I guess its not super noticeable but its not super Sleek either the the bezels again are narrow enough for modern day display standards and then you have a average size forehead at the very top though at the center of it you have a 720p webcam something that did disappoint me as hoping by this point Lenovo would shift to a full HD1 but I guess somehow including a privacy shutter is supposed to make you forget about that fact if Lenovo could save the world by upgrading the display on this laptop I feel like they would just let the world end because we still get that same mediocre display weve been getting for years now so things start off normal enough with a standard full HD resolution you have a 16x9 aspect ratio additionally a standard 60 hertz refresh rate heck you even get a nice IPS panel with decent viewing angles now you only get 300 nits of peak brightness I know it could be worse at 250 but this display easily gets Overcomer when youre using it in bright daylight settings but the real crime over here by far is that 45 ntsd color rating or approximately 56 srgb rating colors look depressed on this thing they need therapy literally if you are using this for Microsoft Excel youre not gonna care but if youre using this or photo editing or any other color sensitive activity keep in mind this display is not designed for that kind of stuff and that may be a deal killer for some people performance on this machine is very impressive despite having a mirror useries I3 chip these 13th generation chips are no joke daytoday web browsing and watching video for example are all gonna be super Snappy as you might have guessed but even more demanding activities like programming or 3D modeling are not only possible they work well enough on a machine like this of course I would recommend a more powerful machine if thats going to be your daily use case and when I really push this machine to its limit by doing multilayer 4K video editing on DaVinci Resolve to my absolute surprise despite the limited 8 gigabytes of RAM I was still able to actually perform edits and yes there were occasional frame drops and it wasnt an ideal experience but it was ultimately possible something that I would not have expected with a chip of this caliber now in terms of gaming I was again pleasantly surprised games like fortnite can easily run on Lower settings at 30 plus frames per second despite only having Intels basic UHD Graphics again casual gaming is very much possible on here while this laptop may run fast it also runs pretty hot so under unrealistic Peak loads we were able to hit surface temperatures right around 44 degrees Celsius even sustained loads yielded around 40 degrees celsius which in my opinion is a number thats not very healthy for a useries I3 chip but what really makes me sweat is the fact that we were able to hit fan noises around 56 decibels despite having a single fan set up on this machine and to make matters worse the fan goes off pretty much anytime youre doing anything thats more intensive lets say running Microsoft Word now to be entirely fair this problem seems to be rampant across all Intel 13th generation chips they run far too hot in my opinion and can have repercussions in the long term so its not a problem exclusive to this model but that is definitely a concerning point over here you have a 47 watt hour battery on here which roughly equates to about seven hours of real world usage assuming youre doing mostly light load activities in terms of the sound quality you do have a top fine Grill like I mentioned its a stereo speaker setup but its very underwhelming sound theres not getting a lot of depth to it have a quick listen for yourself Music Music now based on lenovos website this laptop retails for approximately 640 US Dollars and if Im being honest that price might be slightly more on the expensive side for an I3 chip but in all fairness Lenovo definitely proves itself in the performance Department the 13th generation i3 chips are very powerful theyre doing tasks that I would not expect them to do like the ability to do programming modeling and even video editing to an extent aside from that I think lenovos specialty Remains the fact that it offers one of the best keyboard and trackpad experiences you will find in the laptop industry even at a midrange level that we see over here plus improvements like backlighting and slight revisions to the i o poor diversity definitely make this a lucrative laptop for productivity specialist now with that said the display remains as mediocre as ever if you are someone whos more on the creative industry this laptop might not be the best option for you especially when compared to Dells 5000 series of Inspiron laptops now with that said of course for General productivity I can wholeheartedly recommend this laptop and if youre looking at something thats not two or the top has a clean yet simple design lenovos IdeaPad 3 Series definitely hits all the right check marks in that regard let me know what you thought of this review and what you think of this laptop Id love to hear all your thoughts thanks again for watching catch you in the next one",

  "I so agree with you I actually tried calling the Lenovo Premium Support here in the Philippines about this issue but all they said was it only supports one type of keyboard light it cannot be adjusted because it was according to the specs of the laptop but honestly I doubt it because if it only supports one type of light then how come whenever we reboot it or turn it on its showing us maximum brightness Really frustrating",

  "so this right here is the Lenovo Idea pad 3 and it has been my daily laptop for a couple of weeks now and in this video I will be sharing my experience with it so first lets get it out of the way already that this is a budget or entry level laptop mainly Focus for productivity now with that out of the way lets start with the design now I actually do like the clean and minimal look that it is going for I think it is pretty sweet and perfect for a daily driver the build itself is most mostly plastic but it doesnt really feel cheap or have any weird bending or quality issues it also has a good selection of ports with an SD card reader on the right side and a fulls sizee USB now to the left side it has another fulls sizee USB an HDMI port for an external display a USB typec port and an headphone jack which is really nice to have now the device itself is on the bigger side since it is 156 in I will talk more about the display later but even though it is on the larger side it is still portable enough that I can carry it around and fit it inside my backpack now due to it being large they managed to fit a fullsize keyboard the keyboard itself is pry nice I really enjoyed using and tapping on it the keys got good travel in them and I dont really have any complaints about it other than it is not backlit I think they should have added that since it is very difficult to type on especially at night now that is something to keep in mind though I do not see it as a deal breaker the trackpad though is on the smaller side also something to keep in mind but he also got a fingerprint reader that is very convenient and actually very fast so now lets move on to the display so it is a 60 HZ 1080p IPS panel for some that might be a deal breaker but the Target customer of this laptop is probably not going to care but yeah the display isnt really all that great it lacks color or contrast everything really seems to be Overexposed in some way and the viewing angles are just straight up terrible though it gets bright enough indoors and Outdoors just dont use it against direct sunlight and the hinge that holds the display pushes way back almost 180 I dont really use this feature that often but it is good to have so now lets move on to the performance now keep in mind that this is a productivity focused laptop that means gaming isnt really a thing for this guy especially its only relying on the CPU for all of its processing power though some light games could still be enjoyable like valerant I was able to get a consistent 90 to 100 FPS on 1080p sometimes even more but dont expect any graphical intensive games coming out from this device now as far as what it is supposed to do it does it pretty well I mean it flies through Windows multitasking is also great content consumption is also enjoyable and just basic tasks like editing docum doents and stuff you can expect that this machine can handle it without any hiccups and you can only hear the fan crank up when doing heavy stuff such as playing games or watching a ton of YouTube videos but mostly the laptop stays quiet and cool now to the battery so I was able to get 5 to 6 hours sometimes even less basically just doing some school works or watching videos and Im mostly on 75 to Max brightness and Im also on performance mode now I do usually plug it in if I know I am going to be doing some battery sacking tasks but yeah I dont really have any complaints or what not on the battery life and also it charges pretty fast so thats a nice bonus now some additional things that I havent yet mentioned the builtin speaker on this laptop is also decent can definitely fill a small room and it is perfect for watching content or listening to some tunes now the builtin webcam is not really good its a 720p low resolution camera paired with the builtin mics basically theyre just good for video calls though I got to mention the physical camera slider off top is actually a nice touch definitely good for privacy now lastly the storage now it comes with a half a terab of space which I think is plenty enough for storing files and apps that you might need so when choosing my daily laptop I had some criteria that I wanted to meet first it has to be light enough that I can carry it anywhere and fit it inside my backpack now Im not really a big fan of gaming laptops myself most of them are thick and heavy and Im not really on the gamer aesthetic that they are going for plus I dont really game and I just want my daily driver to be clean and minimal next is since Im a student it has to help me with my school Works basically just editing a bunch of documents and doing some research next up is it has to satisfy me with my cont consumption which is just watching a bunch of YouTube videos animes or just listening to music and lastly it has to be budget friendly and it absolutely Nails all of those criterias so Im not really a power user thats why its kind of perfect for me but depending on what you do on your laptop your situation may vary for example if you are looking for a much better performing laptop that can handle gaming or video editing this might not be for you so if you are like me not a heavy user maybe you need a laptop for school or you need a budget friendly laptop you could definitely consider this but that is pretty much it for this review if yall got

  "I actually reviewed my first Lenovo 3i all the way back when I first started this channel it was one of the first laptops I reviewed and at the time I didnt know it is one of the most popular laptops globally it sells like hot cakes since then Ive reviewed the new iteration every single year fast forward to today and theres no exception to that rule this right here is the latest idea pad 3i its rocking Intels new meteor leag core 3 processor additionally we have 8 GB of ddr5 memory a modest 512 GB sa drive and we also of course have Intels integrated base Graphics combined with WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 52 and finally this is a 15in full HD display now the IAD 3i kind of segments itself as a budget laptop though the price has been creeping up over the years as such were going to see if its still worth its price and of course what kind of value you can expect from this this Baseline laptop so lets get into it from an unpackaging experience theres really not a whole lot to say its pretty straightforward once you open the box behind some protective packaging we have the idea pad 3i itself in that gorgeous Abyss blue color but more than that in a quick minute we also have the inclusion of a standard 65 wat charging adapter unfortunately even after all these years were still not getting USBC out of the box which really is a bit of a shame you also have the standard while outter charging cable piece design wise the Lenovo idad 3i is becoming a broken record theyve been recycling the same design for at least four generations now and the fact is that while its still a practical design it is starting to look dated it doesnt look Sleek anymore and given how popular this laptop is you would think lenov would show a little bit more love its still got those linear edges a straightforward design though itll still do well in most business and Casual environments alike it also has a full plastic body which is normal for most budget laptops now with that said you do have a weight just shy of 36 lbs which is about average for your well typical 15in laptop starting with the top side again a flat clean surface theres no unnecessary textures its to the point that Abyss blue color really does shine nicely here and then you have some Lenovo badging on that corner in terms of ports I think we have a pretty fair representation so on one side we do have the DC charging port we also have a dated HDMI 14 port a usba super speed port and a typec non Thunderbolt 4 Port however we do get display port and power delivery functionality built in so Rejoice on the other side one more usba Super Speed port and interestingly enough a fullsized SD card reader what I always find funny here is that Lenovo often forgets to include a SD card reader on some of their more expensive laptops but they never forget to include one on the idead 3i which is always kind of funny to me bottom side of the laptop you have a standard plastic surface finish finish though it is removable and also youll notice that the air intake fent area is slightly larger this year compared to previous generations which should be good for thermals and then youll notice that there are no speaker grills at the bottom which means that we have a top firing speaker system sound test to follow later on in the video as soon as you unfold this laptop surprise surprise its the exact same design as last year and the year before that and the year before that which means you get that same plastic inner chassis which in itself is totally acceptable given the price range the this blue color again is a rinse and repeat and everything else looks more or less the same though you do get a decent amount of pommer space thanks to the 15in form factor now one thing that has improved definitely is the trackpad quality make no mistake its still a plastic surface finish but look how little Flex there is given this is a plastic finishing I mean I was genuinely impressed its more tactile than ever before and the calibration is on point this is one of the best nonglass surface trackpads Ive used in a while and credits doe with where its du the keyboard on this laptop genuinely is my favorite part about it in fact its so good that it blows a lot of Premium laptops away from other manufacturers look at the key caps theyre large theyre well labeled theyre spread out for the most part making it nice and easy to use and of course you get the inclusion of a 10 keypad given this is a 15in laptop you also have a builtin fingerprint scanner which doubles as the power button and the keyboard is fully back lit no matter which configuration you get which is nice now what I love the most is the typing quality you get a decent amount of key travel and my goodness is a tactile its impressive how good this keyboard is and it actually really does put a lot of other expensive laptops to Absolute shame in that department right above the keyboard you have a nice large top firing speaker system with a grill over here well talk more about that towards the end of the video now I also want to mention that the hinge quality here is concerning just like previous generations its a single tier mechan mechanism theres a lot of wobble an immense amount of pressure when youre unfolding the laptop and if youre not cautious with it you will definitely end up breaking the hinge through longterm wear and TI so keep that in mind now you also have a plastic trimming display finish here so youll notice you have a relatively thin chin at the bottom though its still notable the bezels while not super immersive are fine enough for modern day standards and then you have again a relatively thin forehead at the top though you get a bit of a bump at the center of which you will find a really meaty ochre 720 NP webcam which honestly is an afterthought you look blurry in it theres not a lot of light compensation so you know its just kind of there hey everyone still here Im so happy to see that if youre enjoying the content a friendly reminder please consider subscribing to this Channel and liking this video it helps me earn my bread and butter and means the world to me no more on this lets continue in terms of the actual display itself its more or less the same as the previous generation with one positive difference so things start off with a nice high quality 15in IPS panel a full HD resolution which gives you a 16x9 aspect ratio the refresh rate is still at base 60 HZ all of these are fair enough though at this class segment you also have a peak brighten of 300 nits which is about 50 more than the previous iteration which means this laptop does a little bit better in moderate to welllit settings now dont get too excited because the color rating is still stuck at 45 ntsc which basically means that other than General stuff this laptop is not recommended for color sensitive activities like photo or video editing though again you probably will need a more powerful laptop for that anyway a quick recap of the specifications weve got Intels meter Le core 3 processor which can also be configured as a core 5 processor you do get 8 GB as the standard Baseline but you can configure at 16 depending on where you are in the world and then you also have Intels integrated Graphics regardless of which configuration you get daytoday activities like word crunching or surfing the web or watching HD content is going to be a breeze for this machine more demanding activities like writing or compiling code for example are technically possible but having a mere 8 GB of RAM in 2024 does provide certain limitations and if you do anything more intensive than that like lets say 1080p video editing which you resolve again due to the limited amount of ram over here the processor seems to be constantly bottleneck which results in a lot of frame drops and a choppy experience if youre doing multilayer 10dp video editing and its going to be and even worse experience and anything higher than that forget it again the key problem here is that Lenovo thinks its okay to have 8 gab as the standard in 2024 for a budget laptop I think they should have been 16 GB the fact that you have to configure optionally is a bit of a downo here now on a lighter note gaming performance for a nongaming laptop is pretty good games like fortnite can actually run really close to 60 frames per second on Lower settings this is something that wasnt possible with previous generations and its pretty impressive on both the integrated Graphics part as well as the core 3 processors part so thumbs up there thermals on the other hand are fantastic so under unrealistic Peak loads this laptop barely hit 38 C however under more realistic sustained loads we hover around the 35 Celsius Mark which is about a 5 Dee Improvement compared to the previous generation not shabby at all even fan noise isnt too bad we do occasionally exceed numbers over 50 DB but these are only in moments we really pushing this laptop to its absolute limit otherwise you usually hover well below the 50 Mark if youre thinking about self upgrading the ram is entirely solded on this machine which is why its super important you get 16 GB if you have the option cuz you cannot upgrade the eight once you get this laptop you do have one m2 slot to upgrade the SSD though its preoccupied so youll have to replace the existing storage and then you also have a m2 slot for the WiFi and connectivity module meaning you can upgrade that as well down the road you get a 40 7 W hour battery here which isnt going to provide you with a ton of capacity so you can expect about 10 hours of runtime which is still an improvement compared to prev Generations though I was hoping for a little bit more given that the new meteor leg chips are supposed to be more power efficient now the speaker system here genuinely surprised me for context the speakers on this laptop are actually better than what you get on the likes of the Lenovo slim 7 thats right its kind of disturbing you have a little bit more base you have more depth less Distortion and while theyre not going to be the best speakers out there not bad for a laptop of this class heres a quick sound Music test my mind cant wait sheight that she with a starting price of 660 for the configuration we see here this laptop has definitely been creeping up in price since we first reviewed it all those years back which also means I keep this laptop at a higher standard when reviewing it and look on one side things are great you still have one of the best trackpads and keyboard youll find in this price segment youve got a decent standard of ports and combine that with the fact that you have great speakers oddly enough and also decent battery life its actually a pretty good General productivity machine However the fact that Lenovo continues to recycle the same design or hasnt made any general improvements to the form factor just kind of make this laptop seem a little a little bit more chunky when compared to some of the competition in a similar price range and also having 8 GB of RAM at this price point is in my opinion a little bit cheap skating your customers because frankly 16 gigb should be the minimum in 2024 for ideal performance and longterm reliability nonetheless despite this if you find this laptop at a slightly cheaper price point than its base configuration I think its still a great General productivity machine and its fairly reliable as long as youre okay with the limitations I mentioned let me
