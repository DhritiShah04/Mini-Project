  "here we have the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 now in a world where a carton of eggs is reaching ten dollars you struggle to find a good deal on something and that goes for electronics as well but the idea of flex 5 is a reasonably priced machine coming in roughly at about 629 dollars and it offers a lot of bang for your buck at least on paper so what we want to do is find out if this Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 is any good and if you should buy one yourself and before we get started I would like to ask anybody that if you enjoyed this video please like And subscribe it really does help this channel a lot and helps us continue to deliver transparent and bias free content lets get some specs out of the way really quick this one comes with the AMD 5500u processor it comes with 16 gigabytes of ddr4 RAM and that is not user upgradable and it also comes with a 512 gigabyte nvme solid state drive which is user upgradeable pair that with AMD Radeon graphics and all in all youve got a very high performing computer for under 700 its hard to ask for a whole lot more but lets talk about the LCD screen for a little bit has a 14 inch LCD screen it is full high definition touch it is very colorful it is glossy it has about 300 nits of brightness which means that you can use it like on a college campus in a library inside next to an open window but youre probably going to struggle a little bit with direct sunlight right onto it also because it is so super glossy the viewing angles on it even though it is IPS there thwarted slightly you could certainly gather a crowd around it to watch a YouTube video or maybe even a movie possibly well get into that a little bit more later but that said though theyre the the glare on the screen is just maybe like like just like a little bit too its just its like theres a little bit of clear to be expected but its a really really nice panel we go ahead and rate it a four and a half out of Im sorry a four out of five now by the way everybody we have actually changed our rating system we used to do things out of 10 now were doing them out of five were kind of test running a little bit of a new rating system here anyway moving right along performance on this thing is Stellar we rate it about a four out of five now if we switch over here we went ahead and did some benchmarks opencl gets a 30 20 13 13 020 and then on the single core and multicore you have a 1099 and 5990 respectively and as usual on this channel those that want to know what that information means already know what it means so we will not describe what it means suffice is saying that practically speaking this laptop is exquisitely fast if you are doing like multiple Firefox tabs and chrome windows and email and word and PowerPoint and Excel and all that good stuff this thing will handle that with absolutely no problem at all gaming on this thing is going to be a little bit unusual its not a gaming computer but you could certainly play Minecraft in Roblox and some other games on Lower settings it shouldnt struggle with that at all but as far as like 4K raw video editing um youre probably going to want to stay away from that serviceability on the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 is fantastic you have a separate sister board here for the power button and then the two USB ports thats nice in case one of those goes out you only have to replace this one board you do have an nvme slot right here that is used to replaceable with something bigger if you want about really the only thing that takes a bit of a hit is the ram this one does come with 16 gigabytes but it is not upgradable Lenovo doesnt really give that option on a lot of their computers for some reason but um anyway its its other than that screen battery all that stuff is good to work with but while were on the subject of 4K raw video editing lets go ahead and talk about the input and output on this thing although before I do that were going to go ahead and switch over back to the nice little geometric shapes now input and output on this thing is a five out of five it is absolutely fantastic again especially for the price that youre buying this thing for on here you got two USB super speed ports type a uh one of theyre both one of them one of them is always on meaning that like if you had a cell phone or something that you wanted to charge while this thing is sleeping it can do that with no problem you have a fullsize SD card reader right here thats just the little power button and then on this side you have a trrs headphone jack basically microphones and headphones can plug into there you have a USBC 32 gen 1 Port I think it is it supports both power and data transfer on it as well basically you can charge the laptop on here and then you can also get 10 gigabytes per second data rates which is pretty nice youve got HDMI on here oh and by the way another little quick thing about the USBC Port you cannot put a display on it uh HDMI port for those that want to attach a monitor and then of course where you plug it in because it doesnt run on solar energy but where it lacks in solar charging capabilities it has absolutely phenomenal input and output especially for the price basically if you are a photo a photographer doing something on site um an audio production person basically somebody that has like a switchboard lots of microphones this kind of thing you are really not going to want for a whole lot more this thing will do photoshop with no problem it will do um audio processing with no brow problem you have again all those nice ports for things that you just want to attach to it and modularity and all that good stuff so yeah ports on this thing absolutely outstanding we really really appreciate lenovos efforts in the input and output now lets talk about the keyboard on this computer keyboard is a little bit of a mixed bag it is backlight which I really like the keys are very responsive and very tactile however this the keys on it are unusually wide now if you just look at them they look like normal laptop keys but if you were to actually take like a like some calipers and measure them out they are slightly wider than most other keyboard keys are and as a result you will find yourself accidentally hitting the question mark button which is also wider than the comma and the period button by like just a hair and youll also find yourself accidentally hitting the enter button as well it is not a deal breaker but if youre somebody that is like a super fast typist and youre used to other keyboards you will maybe find the transition to this keyboard to be a little bit awkward that said again it is backlit it does not have a fullsize numpad and it does just feel kind of good and firm to type on so were going to rate the keyboard three out of five its not its not great and its something that you could probably get used to but its its just something worth noting that Lenovo just did some weird stuff with the spacing on the keys and made it kind of weird unless unless youre like shin Lim and you just have like little magic fingers youre just gonna have to kind of get used to it its just weird trackpad on this thing though does get a four out of five it is actually pretty like graciously big and multigesture uh recognizes left and right clicks very well doesnt ghost too bad maybe just slightly and for that matter the trackpad also is like a slightly like little firmer than I wish Lenovo track pads tend to actually have a little bit of a lighter mechanical click than the Dell keyboards this or Dell track pads this one kind of feels more like a Dell track pad but that said it is a good track pad and those using it will have no problems whatsoever and then the last coverage on the sort of usability on this machine uh the touch the touch screen does have some active pen support in there too so those that want to use this thing as a notebook or a note taking machine will have no problem basically this thing just flips it just it can it converts like this and then it turns into like a little tablet that you could take some notes on if you were a student all right so I wanted to talk about the pen support really quick it is worth mentioning that this computer is one of the few computers and for that matter one of the few lenovos that actually comes with a pen comes with a little holster that you can clip to the computer and then it comes with an active Lenovo pen as well that is kind of a nice touch on lenovos part but basically you can convert this thing into a tablet here then obviously you can write on it so just put hello it is very responsive I mean again latency is really not bad but I just dont think reasonably speaking youre going to have anybody wanting to take notes with it the pen tip on it is just its a little too rubberized to make writing all that good so I mean you know your doing awesome I mean I dont know theyre just it just doesnt look all that good its a little clunky um you could obviously draw with this thing but you know ultimately I think people will be using this as maybe like an artistic pen and or tablet but probably not really much for notetaking that said Ive always kind of found that to be slightly gimmicky on some laptops and while it does have pen support and it is also accurate with like lower latency the best notetaking experience is probably going to be done on something like an iPad or a remarkable thats going to be like the most true to like pen and paper that you can get now lets talk about these speakers on this computer they are advertised to be Dolby audio and they are an absolute disaster we rate the speakers on here a one out of five they are tinny they have no character they dont get particularly loud and as I said earlier you can use the screen to like gather around with friends and watch a movie except that the speakers on this thing are so damn awful that nobody around the laptop would be able to hear it I theyre not the worst speakers Ive heard in a laptop but they are almost the worst speakers that I have heard in a laptop Lenovo should be ashamed of themselves now that said you do have the audio jack on the side of it so of course you can pop in a set of external speakers or headphones and it wont be an issue whatsoever but thats said its almost like they went out of their way to put the junkiest part spin speakers in there and then slaps a Dolby badge on there why do manufacturers insist on Advertising good speakers on them when they just they just put crap in there so anyway one out of five now lets talk about the features of this computer which are shockingly fantastic we give it a five out of five it has Wireless ax or 6 in it it has Bluetooth it has a very respectable webcam in it in fact heres what that footage looks like now this is a test of the webcam on the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 this is actually one of the better webcams we have tested in a while so color us impressed it has a little privacy shutter on the webcam as well so if youre one that wants to like walk around naked in front of their laptop but they dont want an only fans page then well then here you go youve got some privacy built in it also has a fingerprint reader it does not have a Windows hello compatible camera but it does have USBC charging it also has rapid charging basically meaning it can charge up pretty fast and then of course as I mentioned earlier it does have the 360 degree turned into a notebook tablet feature in there too so for the price at 630 bucks I mean I just really dont know what more youd want in there there are much more expensive laptops with less so thats why we always try to take into consideration the price bracket that the computer is sitting in when we give it a rating so yeah again for the price it absolutely earned its five out of five and for our final category the mobility category it gets a four and a four out of five I keep wanting to say four and a half out of five a four out of five should we do halves well maybe reach out in the comments section and find that out anyway Mobility on this thing its kind of heavy boy its a big boy its about 33 pounds so its not light but the materials are all incredibly well put together it just feels firm and like it can take a beating the Plastics are really really great quality the hinges are nice and smooth by all accounts I think that this thing could go from like laptop to desk or not from desk to backpack to airplane tray table to classroom back to your desk and like all all while getting rattled around with keys and tablets and charging cords and things and this thing would hold up really really well were very impressed with the quality of the materials that Lenovo decided to use with this thing again just some really really great Plastics and you know again there are more expensive laptops that are like cheaper built so they did a great job there battery life on it is going to be between about eight and a half to nine hours practically speaking and again for those that are traveling or running through airports or going to classrooms that is effectively allday battery life and you might get a little bit more if youre like only doing like word and and stuff like that but youll get a little bit less if youre doing something like internet browsing so yeah battery life on it is great materials on it are great its a little bit Hefty so I mean and in terms of like thickness and stuff I mean its kind of thick but like its not like its it had a couple it had too few many Christmas cookies but its still lightweight and compact enough where you can just Chuck it into a briefcase and maybe your Mystery Ranch briefcase or Tokyo bellroy and then youll be right as rain so again all in all earns its four and a half out of five now who is this last top four we really feel that this laptop is for like business people that like to travel a lot uh it is also for people that just need a solid productivity Powerhouse and they dont really mind the slightly smaller screen after all 14 inch screens are my favorite form factor but that said if you dont need the 15 or the 16 inch screens and you just need something kind of nice and Compact and lightweight to sit on your desk and just do its thing this is absolutely perfect for it frankly even nonprofits could do pretty well with this laptop and again at 630 bucks you really get like I mean you get a lot of bang for your buck and because of the serviceability on it where you could replace something like the screen or the nvme drive or something like that if it breaks I mean thats going to this is going to be like a laptop that you can have around for five to six years easily lenovos warranty and customer service is really not too bad its maybe not quite as good as Dells but it is definitely better than Hewlett Packards and probably even like Acer and Asus although a series is pretty solid but nevertheless lenovos customer support is is pretty you know pretty standard across the board so thats good too I think that if youre a photographer and you like to take photos and then load those pictures onto your laptop and kind of edit on site or or just kind of have the laps out there sort of like a backup hard drive this things going to be perfect for that I think this is going to be perfect for audio editors dont really think its going to be that great for video editors you could maybe do some 1080p compressed stuff but yeah I might struggle a little bit not really for gamers either although it can do some light gaming but all in this is just a computer for like students and like business people this is like this is like the new everyday working mans ThinkPad anyway we were very very impressed with this Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 it gets a total score of 375 out of five now that may seem like a bad score but thats like thats like a B minus I mean thats like a very respectable score if they just maybe put in slightly better speakers or maybe just kind of made their keyboards slightly less weird than um I dont know itd be almost perfect one oh actually there is one little fun thing that I noticed on the Lenovo keyboard it says caps LK even though you have this honking big button they got cheap and didnt want to put like the O and the C for caps lock now I checked all the other Lenovo products that we have in the office and sure enough they all say caps LK whereas all of the hps and Dells and acers here all say caps lock thats just kind of a weird lenovoism apparently I never noticed it before in the like as long as Ive been reviewing these things but anyway its just kind of a fun thing to point out anyway I hope that this video was helpful let us know what you think

  "Possibly updated model",
  "You would not be able use two monitors on an HDMI splitter",
  "But my theory of advertising Dolby THX Harman etc as a means of advertising superior audio quality and in turn having horrible speaker quality is almost always true and stands to point",
  "ComputerStuff absolutely they definitely use weird hard hitting names to make their product look better in the eyes of the buyer Therefore it is important to know what they mean both Dolby and THX or sometimes Atmos these are signal processing systems all it tells is that the product can handle certain tasks like surround sound for example But it does not mean the built in speakers can handle it Extremely misleading However when it says Bang Olufsen Harman AKG JBL etc These are are speaker brand names Dropping one of these in and deliver crap audio would ultimately damage the brands name and reputation With that said there are a lot of laptops with heavy hitting speaker names that sound garbage a story for another time maybe Great review btw",

  "bro does it have soldered ram",
  "The Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 is complete garbage The monitor is made of plastic so it easy to break And I got quoted a price of 800 to repair it cost to buy is 1200 Now a second hand one is 700 Its disgusting what Lenovo did to users THey could of used a 4k screen thats cheaper than the 22k screen Screwed over the user for sure",

  "This is a standard laptop and this is a specialized 2in1 What if they had a baby May I present to you The Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 A standard 2in1 Is it worth it Weve got 7 items to cover so lets go over the raw stats First pricing The IdeaPad 5 is a 2in1 laptop with pretty good specs for the price About 85000 starting and 700 when on sale which is a great deal for what you get Including a 14 inch 1080p display thats also IPS so a fairly sizable screen with great viewing angles On top of that its also touchscreen and has the ability to use the Lenovo pen to take notes which is great because the laptop has a hinge to move the keyboard out of the way and turn into a tablet Speaking of great things connectivity Its just incredible with this laptop and funnily blows some of the more premium laptops out of the water I mean take a look at the list For internal specs its pretty good First 16 gigabytes of RAM which is amazing for productivity and you can run a lot of programs with that And second the AMD Ryzen 5500U can run a lot of different programs as well including productivity ones and gamingrelated ones such as GTA V if you scale the quality back a little But of course this isnt a gaming laptop so dont expect amazing especially graphical performance Here are the benchmarks And now for storage the laptop is okay 256 gigabytes for a retail of 850 Eh the laptop could use a little bit more If you want more you can always buy a flash drive or an external SSD And the battery life is pretty good Some people have gotten upwards of 14 hours and some about 9 so were going to take Lenovos word and just say about 12 which is still really impressive And lastly the laptop runs Windows 11 And now before we get onto my verdict heres what the reviewers said about the laptop The IdeaPad Flex 5 was praised for its build battery life and security features And it was critiqued for its weight bugginess in tablet mode and webcam quality So is the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 worth it I mean its just a normal boring laptop right Well yes and no Its more of a standard or yeah normal laptop meaning it doesnt have all the bells and whistles a more premium one would have such as the Surface Pro 8 But Thats what makes it good Its a nofrills device thats just used to get work done And its tablety so its a laptop that can also tablet when you want it to so it still does have some useful quirks But going back to the original topic the question really should be Is this laptop worth it for you Moreover does the laptop cover your needs and provide what you want If it does then Id say its worth it to at least consider it Because if you want a multifunctional nononsense 2in1 machine The Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 is an excellent choice But if it doesnt then we gotta keep searching But ultimately all of this is your decision based on your preferences Dont just watch my video on this Ive linked many more down in the description to view at your discretion My name is Cyrus Its spelled like Cyrus pronounced like See Rooster just take out the ter Thank you very much for watching good luck with your purchase and have a wonderful day",

  "Hey Thanks for the comment Regarding the rubber feet for the device many people have this issue unfortunately I would actually recommend contacting customer support since you just got this device and try to see if you can get some sort of warranty replacement If they are unresponsive to your request I would suggest buying your own protective rubber that you can just tape to the back of the device Sorry to hear about your experience with the device Hope this helps Have a wonderful day",
  "SeeRoosterTech Oh thanks for the tip By warranty replacement do you mean some of the flex 5s do come with rubber feet I didnt know that or that I could ask for it I also see a small line on the screen so I guess I need to have it replaced anyway",

  "tharinisachindyafernando9842 for me i like it its not so light but the weight give me some durability felling Iam using it to office work and playing games For me the pen is so much useful to taking some fast note but if its for drawing i dont think i cant explain it to well because iam not using that for drawing maybe just some scribble And the only games i played just genshin impact even tough it get hot around keyboard but it manageable and i use tent mode when playing games to reduce the heat and expose the fan The minus is maybe you cant place the pen actually it come with some add ondevice to plug the pen to the usb port but the laptop just have 2 usb port so it tricky to use it and iam so worried to scratch my keyboard edge when iam using tablet mode because i havent find the case or keyboard cover or maybe some little cushion for that but so far is still good because iam not using tablet mode so much Hope you can understand what iam trying to say because English isnt my first languages Hope you can find your best laptop for you",
  "tharinisachindyafernando9842 So far the laptop is great Id say 70 of my class has a macbook but this laptop is just fine for me Its very nice to have a laptop that can fold and be positioned with a touch screen Im not too big on taking notes on devices as I like to write in my notebook I have downloaded good notes for windows and its not too bad The only con I have with this laptop would be the battery life Fully charged I think it lasts about 46 hours If i leave my laptop in the car and go to class I have to make sure my charger is with me always just incase",
  "tharinisachindyafernando9842 Nope I stopped looking lol",
  "The laptop is heavy compared to a Ipad and its not ideal to be walking using it as one It feels awkward holding is folded like a laptop because the keys are exposed so the hand that you have on the back of the Tablet will be against the keyboard",
  "Regarding laptop longevity Id recommend getting the 16GB version if you intend on using it for 5 years Office work and Google searching should be easily handled by the device But Id recommend upgrading the RAM to again 16GB to ensure that it will last a while Good luck with everything Have a wonderful day",

  "Sweet Have a wonderful day",
  "So to start off the IdeaPad 3 is a little cheaper for the starter model so if you want to save some cash you can go with the 3 However overall Id recommend to take a look at your needs For instance if youre going to college and want a device to use for written notes etc the Flex 5 would be the better option On the other hand if you just need a simple laptop the IdeaPad 3 is better Hope this helps Have a wonderful day",

  "Hey The Flex 5 is a more consumerfriendly 2in1 from Lenovo while the Yoga can be configured to be a bit more expensive and premium Id say most people should check out the IdeaPad Flex first But for those who want to purchase a more professional flexible laptop they should probably look at the Yoga",
  "SeeRoosterTech This or the HP Pav 360 i3",

  "this laptop is the worst equipment I have had it does not meet any expectations and nothing can be done on it because playing is only in the lowest graphics and full of lags moreover the laptop heats up very quickly and how it would explode today despite the fact that the laptop is just getting on its own he turned off and shows me a black screen although I did not destroy it it stopped working on its own I do not recommend this laptop in my opinion it is not worth buying even for 50 euros",
  "Dont Buy it many Internal issues If you folded laptop as tablet and then turn off laptop then unfortunately battery is drained and laptop got hot and surprisingly fan sometimes off or sometimes on state During watching videos sometimes video hang issues observed for little milliseconds This laptop cannot utilize all core speed if you work on multi core then you got only 33 to 337 ghz clock speed Poor webcam totally rubbish In room if you opened your window then you have to be struggle with 250nits brightness display Fingerprint sometimes worked and sometimes not worked if you tuned on flip to start And mostly this laptop not compatible with windows 11 Just this laptop has really low latency while writing on screen good battery backup and good speaker",

  "Why is this still 600",
  "Hey This is the Flex 5 I believe youre referring to the Flex 5i The 5i is the Intel version Hope this answers your question Have a wonderful day",

  "SeeRoosterTech u gotta keep it up man",

  "Music hey whats up everybody Josh here and this is the 14in idea pad Flex 5i 2 in1 the flex gives you the best of both worlds both tablet and laptop with fantastic battery life thanks in part to its gen 11 Intel processor and Iris XE graphics and coming in at 33 lb and a4 of an inch thick this thing is perfect for people on the go and while the flex 5 is priced like a budget laptop this specific model offers some premium features like a bundled digital pen fingerprint reader and a backlit spill resistant keyboard but of course the big feature here is the 360 hinge the twoinone convertible design lets you use it in laptop stand tent and tablet modes for instance you can use it in laptop mode for typing tent for browsing the internet stand for watching videos and tablet mode for Touch navigation this model is sporting an 1135 G7 at 24 GHz Intel Iris XE Graphics 16 gigs of nice fast 3200 MHz memory and a 512 gig m2 SSD all of which is a recipe for super Snappy response one of the first things youll notice when opening the Flex 5 is the build quality there is a little bit of screen flex but it still feels really solid the case is made of anodized aluminum polycarbonate and glass fiber which not only makes it extremely durable but also heat resistant and speaking of heat during our benchmark test the processor managed to get up to a toasty 94 C that is however still under the limit for this processor and the average temperature while browsing the web and completing other office related tasks was around a cool 75 C for Io we have a fullsize SD card reader two 32 gen 1 USB ports and on the other side a combo mic and headphone jack 1 32 gen 1 USBC which supports data transfer and power delivery HDMI and a barrel connector for an optional 45 W power adapter the included power adapter is a 65w USBC charger and speaking of charging this machine has both quick charge and smart charge features smart charge allows for 2 hours of use on just a short 15minute charge and Quick Charge technology allows the laptop to charge up to 80 of the 525 wat battery in just 1 hour but how did the battery perform during our Benchmark video playback lasted an impressive 9 hours and 11 minutes at 75 brightness and the headphones at 50 volume and that is without putting it into airplane mode or making any other adjustments the flex 5 has a buttonless multitouch touchpad thats nice and buttery smooth to move around on thanks to its fancy myar surface the keyboard feels great to type on and that nice bright backlight is always a welcome addition to the left and right of the keyboard youll find two watt frontfacing Dolby certified speakers at 100 volume they were Distortion free and plenty loud enough for normal listening they were a little bit on the Tenny side but nothing unusual for a laptop this size above the screen is a 720p webcam which is a bit noisy but pretty standard for a laptop at this price point it does offer a security feature there is a little security shutter so that you can block the webcam when its not in use the screen is a glossy smudge resistant 14in IPS display with a resolution of 1920x 1080 plenty of resolution for this size screen with text and Graphics looking nice and crisp and the screen should get plenty bright enough for you at 250 nits you will occasionally get some glare on the screen but hey its a glossy display nothing new there the screen supports 10 finger gestures and you can write paint or sketch to your hearts content with the included smart pen the smart pen is powered by a quadruple a battery which it comes with and offers 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity the pen comes with a little plastic holder that fits snugly into the USB port which is really handy if youre say carrying this thing around the office and using it in tablet mode lastly for connectivity you have WiFi 6 either ax or AC depending on the machine and Bluetooth 50 so who is this for well its a solid choice for most home or office users as long as you dont need any serious power I mean youre not going to be running CAD software or playing AAA games on this thing but for everything else this is an absolute winner for its

  "Get yours here lenovovzewnetPy5Y9Q Story time So you may notice that this isnt exactly the latest greatest model As the hashtag suggests this is a reupload Reason being theres been a few years of drama with my channel A couple of years ago it was demonetized by YouTube and they wouldnt let me remonetize my content because of an offending video Literally all my videos at that point were tech reviews and photoshop or premiere pro tutorials so I was VERY confused Whats more they wouldnt tell me what the problem was so I could fix it Months went by and they kept rejecting my application for monetization Out of frustration I began moving all my tech content to another channel Then I FINALLY found the offending video It was a tutorial I did demonstrating how to find and edit a narrative video with stock footage One of the clips I used had a CGI dead or dying whale in it the subject of the video was pollution I removed the video and got remonetized Unfortunately the new tech channel struggled to get enough subs to be monetized so I had lost a huge portion of my revenue stream on this channel Fast forward to now I recently posted a video about how Im fed up with YouTubes algorithm Ive always felt like Ive had to split up my content to different channels depending on subject matter to appease the algorithm and meet subscriber expectations Well Im not doing that anymore Its actually kept me from enjoying the creative process and making content As for this video its reappearing here because it was a fairly popular video and I refuse to start from scratch Anyway thanks for watching",
