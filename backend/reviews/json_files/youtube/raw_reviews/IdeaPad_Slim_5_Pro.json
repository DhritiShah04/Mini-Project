  "it is my pleasure to bring you the first look and review of the brand new idea pad 5 pro and whats even better is i have two of them one with an intel 11th gen cpu and one with an amd ryzen 5000 processor if you arent familiar with the ideapad 5 series let me refresh you because its one of the most important laptop series in recent times in 2020 the idea pad 5 laptops particularly with ryzen 4000 cpus were one of the best devices of the year the ideapad 515 and 14 which i have right here really revolutionized the budget laptop category they were the first budget laptops that combined a super powerful cpu with a good enough screen a great keyboard and they were very lightweight to boot all in all they were really the first budget laptops that didnt sacrifice much in fact in my best videos throughout 2020 i awarded the ideapad 515 the best budget laptop you could buy heck to this date my reviews of these laptops are the most viewed on this channel the only major thing wrong with them was that the colors on the displays werent that accurate so you couldnt really use them for photo or video editing plus there were some other little things that i would love to see improved such as a more premium build quality better webcam and less fan noise well today is an exciting day because i have with me the next iteration of these great laptops that promises to deliver a lot more for only around 100 us dollars at least thats what lenovo tells me now keep in mind these are prototypes so things may be different in the final models also these laptops come with a variety of configurations for example my silver model has an intel 11th gen processor paired with a 25 watt nvidia mx450 graphics my dark grey model has a ryzen 5000 series processor with a more powerful nvidia 1650 graphics which lenovo tells me will also be available with the newer more powerful rtx 3050 graphics because of the variations of components and the fact that these are early stage units im not going to go quite as bonkers as i would normally with my performance tests but instead focus more on what its like to use these laptops oh freak in my excitement i forgot to introduce myself if youre new here im josh and i talk tech from the perspective of what its like to own and use these devices if at the end of this video you like what you watched dont forget to smash that subscribe button hit the thumbs up and the notification bell it shows your appreciation for the insane amount of hours that goes into making these and it also makes my mum very happy lets start off with the look and feel of the laptop the ryzen 5000 model is a dark grey and the intel model is a light grey i prefer the color of the intel model with its lid closed its not quite as stunning as a macbook pro 6d but its also not too far off not bad for a midrange laptop with its lid open though it does look a little cheaper than a higher end device like the macbook pro that being said it certainly feels like a high quality build much improved from the plastic feeling ideapad 515 from 2020 there are minimal bezels around the display and the laptop can be opened with one hand one thing that i did like a lot about the ideapad 515 from last year was how lightweight it was at 36 pounds these new models are heavier but then again the chassis is better quality than that device the intel model with the mx450 weighed in at 43 pounds and the amd model with the g4 1650 at 44 pounds this is in line with the macbook pro 16s weight at 43 pounds so its still not too bad the intel variant comes with either an i5 113 ooh cpu or an i71370h which mine has these are the rather confusing new h35 watt intel parts confusing because they are still four core and eight thread 11 gen tiger lake laptop cpus the same as the cpus weve been looking at for the last nine months or so the only difference is they are supposedly designed to work with higher wattage where this falls apart is manufacturers have been feeding the original 11th gen tiger lake laptop cpus with high wattage anyway im looking at you hpn v14 so performance here really isnt that much better as youre about to see it is nice that the intel models do come with an nvidia mx450 graphics as that will provide a nice boost to graphics lets talk about the more interesting amd variants you can get it with either the ryzen 5 5600h or ryzen 75800h which mine has these are super powerful processors with 6 cores and 12 threads and 8 cores and 16 threads respectively i expect these to annihilate the 4 core 8 thread intel variants the amd variant also comes with a gtx 1650 and i believe that in the future you may be able to get it with an rtx 3050 performance of the laptop cant be controlled in lenovos vantage software there is intelligent cooling which is normally a good balance of keeping the laptop quiet and performing well and extreme performance which has the laptop running at its full max performance i ran all my performance tests on extreme performance lets start off with geekbench which tests a variety of performance tasks you can see that the newer h35 intel model does actually perform better than the ultrabook 11th gen cpus that have come before it like in the dell xps 13 or the hp envy 14 the ryzen 5800h model performs much better in multicore but its still not as strong as the hb omen a gaming laptop with the same ryzen processor as you can see the macbook air with apples phenomenal m1 chip still beats out both in this test now lets switch to cinebench which runs the cpu at max here we can see the intel model performing a decent amount better than prior ultrabooks with intels 11th gen cpus but its really the ryzen model that shines in this test its extra 4 cores are being utilized here it performs very well for a midtier device however not as well as the hp omen with the same cpu lets take a look at why this might be the case when we look at power delivery the omen just feeds more power to the cpu so that explains it take a look here that the ideapad 5 pro is delivering a lot more power to the amd variant than the intel one this isnt overly surprising given that the amd model has doubled the threads and cores its actually pretty impressive how little extra power it draws for almost double the performance in multicore lets see how well the laptop can sustain its performance as you can see here when i ran cinebench on repeat for 10 minutes i did not see much of a performance drop which demonstrates an effective cooling solution now when we look at cpu temperatures under full load you can see a good result for the ryzen model and a decent result for the intel model at least it doesnt hit boiling point of 100 degrees celsius like the dell xps that being said the ryzens models better performance comes at the expense of extra fan noise by the way remember how the hp omen performed better with the same ryzen cpu look how much louder the fan noise from that laptop is it sounds like a jet engine and i wouldnt take the trade off for a bit of extra performance versus the idea pad 5 pro the laptop feels very cool to the touch when using it for light tasks like browsing the web you dont have to deal with warm temperatures like on the dell xps 13 for those tasks but then again these are much larger laptops when under max load both these laptops feel pretty cool to the touch particularly the intel model but then again it doesnt perform as well as the ryzen model turning to graphics lets take a look at fire strike the full 25 watt nvidia mx450 in the intel model performs very well giving you a nice performance boost over the integrated graphics in something like the dell xps that being said it cant compete with the 1650 in the ryzen model which is substantially more powerful notice how the ryzen ideapad 5 pro beats out the hp and v14 with a supposed more powerful 1650 ti max q i did note in my review of that laptop that its graphics underperformed ill post a link to that review in the description below check it out as its a good one its a similar story when we look at time spy i cant wait to see how much better this laptop performs with the rtx 3050 its apparently getting so overall performance on this laptop is very good for how cool it feels to the touch and the fan noise the intel model with the h35 cpu and mx 450 graphics is a nice step up from ultrabooks the ryzen model the 8 core cpu and beefier graphics is a very competent performance laptop that will be good enough for some fairly intensive tasks inside the laptop the fan and cooling system seems robust with two large fans i dont see replaceable ram but do see an upgradeable ssd the port situation is ample youve got two usb a ports ill be at the slower 32 gen 1 ports youve also got an hdmi port 14 b and for the models with the integrated graphics or the less powerful geforce mx450 charging will be by a usbc power adapter and both usb c ports do support charging on the models with the more powerful dedicated graphics are the geforce 1650 and above they use lenovos charging port to power the device my model with the g4 1650 came with a 135 watt charger please note that even those laptops can be charged from their single usb c port and i powered my ryzen 5000 model with a tiny 45 watt usbc charger while doing light tasks such as browsing the web and there was no battery drain for the intel models one of the usb c port supports thunderbolt 4 for the ryzen models the fastest youll get is usb c 32 gen 2 youve also got an sd card reader which although handy performed poorly in my tests unfortunately i was getting slow speeds in line with the uhs one card reader the sound from the two down facing speakers at the front of the laptop gets reasonably loud and is clear but it lacks a sound stage and bass the display is a monstrous leap forward on so many dimensions its got a large 16 inch display at 2560x1600 resolution with an aspect ratio of 16x10 and whats super cool is it runs at a fast 120hz refresh rate lets stop for a moment seriously those are some really awesome specs everything looked super sharp at this resolution and with that fast refresh rate any movement like scrolling a web page was very smooth in fact in my excel test which i use to show how much information i can comfortably see on screen without needing to squint at the default 150 window scaling i saw an excellent 41 lines of excel but if i drop the scaling down to 125 percent which i found very viewable i saw a monstrous 52 lines absolutely fantastic if you intend to do productivity work on this laptop compared to its predecessors the idea pad 515 and 14 this display is brighter and the color accuracy has been fixed with an excellent 100 srgb score this monitor is excellent for most use cases although dedicated photo editors should still look elsewhere as the colors arent quite accurate enough for that use case overall two thumbs up for the display oh i believe there will also be a 60hz refresh rate version of the display with similar specs that will be in some units so if you do want that fast 120 hertz refresh rate make sure you buy the right model the keyboard is outstanding there is no odd things in the layout its got a numpad its backlit with two levels and importantly it feels very comfortable a little low travel but honestly as far as laptop keyboards go in 2021 its one of the more comfortable ones the trackpad is a very good one its large tracking is accurate and the click is good enough its not the absolute best trackpad ive used on a windows laptop but you wont have any issues with it one thing that i want to address is that the trackpad is not centered on this chassis this is 100 the correct placement it is shifted to the left because this keyboard has a numpad and therefore the whole thing is shifted to the left the webcam really isnt great here it is in excellent lighting conditions oh and by the way a little birdie told me that in the very near future were going to get much better webcams in laptops by the way if youre wondering what this bar is at the top of this laptop it houses a windows hello ir camera for login there was no fingerprint reader though in my models the laptop comes with a sizable 75 watt hour battery that provides excellent run times i ran both laptops on battery saver mode with brightness down three notches playing netflix movies over wifi for 35 hours the amd model had 48 battery remaining and the intel 56 percent this means you should get at least seven hours on the amd model and around eight on the intel model keep in mind im certain that if you dim the screen further youll be able to eke out around an extra hour these really are very good battery results on a large and powerful laptop particularly the 8 core amd model with the geforce gtx 1650 lastly pricing this was one of the greatest benefits of the ideopad 515 and 14 they were very affordable i remember seeing top spec models with 16 gig of ram for under 800 us dollars i think i saw them priced for around 600 for the entry level models anyway according to my sources these should be around a hundred us dollars more for similar specs however as we know this new pro model can be spec with some pretty powerful components so id imagine it would be priced in the lower to mid range for laptops this brings me to my conclusion if these laptops come in at a thousand us dollars or under especially for the ryzen model the ideapad five pro will be one of the main laptops i recommend most people buy ill basically be asking the following do you need a lot of portability then get the macbook air do you want more productivity get the ideapad 5 pro its larger screen and more powerful components particularly in the ryzen model will really make a difference for office work programming and even light to medium weight video editing heck the 120 hertz refresh rate on the screen and as i said those decent gaming graphics will give you a very good esports gaming experience as well look lenovo really have done a superb job with this laptop im super tough in my reviews and for me to say i will be recommending this laptop for most people for around the thousand us dollar price range is a big win well thats all for today folks if you like this video you know what to do smash that subscribe button hit the thumbs up and the notification bell i would truly appreciate it and so would my mum for behind the scenes coverage and just generally whats going on in my life please follow me on instagram tick tock

  "Amazing video I remember watching your video about the Ideapad 5 15 over a year ago the first time a tech reviewer ever clearly convinced me to get a piece of tech I have loved owning the Ideapad 5 15 and watching your videos since discovering your channel 1010 will be recommending the pro versions to friends and family when they come out",
  "Waited for this I got the IdeaPad 5 last year on Cybermonday for 650 with a full Metal chassis only the display frame is plastic 100 sRGB coverage 16GB RAM 512GB SSD but unfortunately with the i5 1135G7 It still performs enough for my daily usage though For 100 more I couldve gotten the MX450 but I passed on that",
  "Finally the budget thin and light laptops are getting interesting",

  "When can we expect these laptops in the market especially with a higher graphic card",
  "Than you for this review such a gentle guy",
  "One of the best tech reviewers that have impressed me ever since the very start No bullshit fake information just pure detailed information that gives you a better understanding of tech Keep it up Looking forward to 200k Subs",

  "Luk Ondri listing got removed by lenovo",
  "I have it at home I will get to it but I really want to use it properly Unfortunately im away for next 2 weeks",
  "razerlauft1719 He means the Legion 5 Pro",
  "I think I saw someone in Asia mention an Ideapad 5 Slim Pro version which would presumeably have the 15 W 5000u or 4000u series processor units instead of the 5000h series 45 W but still offer these new improved screens with better colour reproduction higher brightness and this taller and more desireable 1610 format Have you heard any news about these upcoming Lenovo models And does the speakers facing downwards instead of upwards as in the earlier Ideapad 5 series have any significant influence on the sound quality Why on earth would Lenovo change such a good selling point that most laptop users would probably prefer my guess if they were given a free choice",
  "christianrussberg4547 OK mange tak tack s mycket",
  "I see them on Costcos website as of July 16",

  "jaydenlee3103 Where did you order it",
  "I was chatting today with someone from Lenovo who said their guesstimate for it being widely available was Sept Oct this year",
  "Josh love the reviews Any ideas if youll be able to get the 14 IdeaPad 5 pro to review Or any idea when these laptops will be available",
  "u are better than all other tech reviewers tbh straight to the point charisma is what i like",
  "Wow I waited this laptop like crazy I am really glad you are the first one to review it",
  "Btw insanely great reviews josh Been following you for quite a while and honestly I dont quite understand how you havent got millions of subscribers yet Keep up the insanely good work i believe its only a matter of time til the YouTube recommendation algorithm do you justice",
  "I need to have a talk with whoever chose the default wallpaper",
  "Lenovo has officially released these and theyll be available in October with preinstalled Windows 11 Theyre called the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro everywhere except America They also have an option for the RTX 3050",
  "800 broke my heart I want a device exactly like this but I need more RAM",
  "346 Polestar 2 grabbed my whole attention Such a beauty Anyway watching your reviews makes me clear on what I should get instead of what I desire",
  "Hey josh any news on the ideapad 5 pro 14 inch model",
  "You are so thorough it is son nice to learn with your channel",
  "bought this laptop with 5800h and gtx 1650 really happy good quality product feels premium not as loud as Reddit guys say the fan comes for a couple of seconds and it stops only when on a charging cable without charging cable its dead silent Ofcourse if you play game or do cpu intensive work fan comes to cool but for my needs it feels normal battery life is good if you are not playing games about 8hours of youtube and basic surfing Really satisfied with this buy Thank you for your review",
  "I have been searching for a laptop for 3 weeks and Im no closer to making a decision than when I first started This is so frustrating I know what I want but I cant get it all in one laptop Why Do they not listen to their consumers I want a laptop with at least a 156 screen because my eyesight is bad I want 16gb ram 256 or 512 SSD numeric keypad on days I work from home a responsive track pad I dont want the screen or keyboard to have much give in it I want good audio a quiet fan I would prefer dual fans because I dont want it to overheat Is that too much to ask Oh and it would be nice if I could get all this under 2 grand",
  "Thx for reviewing I was going to get the Lenovo 5 15 from costco but I will save money and wait for this hopefully it doesnt come out like next Leap Year knowing Lenovo Josh you really are among the best and I hang out on your discord server I watch you and Flossy You are THE BEST for straight specs and honest specuser review It is nice having a reviewer you can trust Love your review of budget laptops for we poor doctoral students Speaking of poor webcams Flossy and White Shoes are straight up hilarious He calls the 780p webcam the 780T T for Trash Good news on getting better webcams",

  "luigigrabspam4596 Maybe",
  "luigigrabspam4596 correct",
  "AnonymousMC idk why you are just responding ok and maybe It takes more to assume he meant it costs 100 than him saying it cost 100 more literally because of everything else he said",
  "luigigrabspam4596 Ok",
  "Thanks for the feedback Btw check out my more recent review on the new 5 Pros for 2022",

  "Josh thank you so much for your research and videos I saw your video last year regarding the Lenovo ideapad 5 15 and went ahead and bought it The best investment Ive made in a budget friendly laptop perfect for working from home I am using the laptop as Im writing and I absolutely LOVE it I cant wait for this new release and buy the updated version 3 Thank you",
  "I just saw that there is a 14 inch model listed on the site with the same specs as the AMD one except the GPU What do you think about it Josh",
  "Very nice preview I was one of the people who bought the Ryzen IdeaPad 5 14 model at top specs The only thing that killed me was the abysmal color accuracy and I dont use it for editing photos or anything color sensitive So it ended up going back and Ive been on the hunt for something that fits the bill for me for the past 9 months If they only made one of these without a number pad so that I would actually be centered to the screen I think it would be a slam dunk for me Maybe there will be a 14 IdeaPad 5 Pro",
  "Lmao its now discontinued Is that normal Wtf is Lenovo doing",
  "These glasses are awesome Keep them",
  "Hi does anyone know when AMD version is available in UK Cheers",
  "Its nice to see the improved screen specs BTW for most photography editing a 100 SRGB display that has been properly calibrated is all you really need Only if you are doing work intended for print or color grading video would you need something more color accurate",
  "I appreciate the insane amount of work that goes into making your videos Your criteria for what is actually important for a dream laptop closely resemble what I consider important productivity screen real estate quiet fans etc though I dont do gaming not even light gaming Thats why Id like to ask whether youll be reviewing Linux laptops too They also ship with Windows preinstalled if this is your cup of tea There is the new Tuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14 which has what I would want with a laptop a 3K 1610 90Hz screen thunderbolt 4 with USBC 40 and power delivery Overall it is highly configurable and parts such as SSD and RAM can be upgraded There is even a second PCIe NVME slot What I do not know however is whether the laptop fan is quiet and whether it has other quirks If you can get a hold of this laptop perhaps you can find the time to review it Cheers Michael",
  "Fantastic review just being harsh yet honest about what the PCs can do",
  "I smashed that subscribe button as soon as I heard it made his mum happy LOL Great video and summary Josh I appreciate the time and research you put into this for your viewers",
  "Wow I am astonished that I found this great review literally answered to all my questions and hesitations I had You are top reviewer Going to get me Ryzen 7 gtx 1650 version",
  "Definitely buying that 120hz color accurate Ryzen 30 series graphics all in a LIGHTWEIGHTpackaged laptop when they come in stock Lenovo really stepping up this year especially since allowing their middleranged and gaming laptops to have their renowned thinkpad keyboards",
  "I was considering getting the gigabyte aero 15 OLED The 1610 aspect ratio on the 16 inch monitor is REALLY swaying my opinion to give this model a serious consideration",
  "Dayyum your studio is so clean and slick",
  "Really nice benchmark comparisons Now I just wish Lenovo could be a bit more transparent about when we could buy these in the US At this rate it almost seems like some of the laptops they showed off at CES 2021 wont come to market until CES 2022 or later",
  "And now I regret buying a Slim 7 last summer especially since classes were mostly online this year The QHD 1610 display would have delighted me being a computer sciences student and the gpu would have been a great bonus",
  "I found your channel because of the ideapad 5 14 review",
  "It looks like Amazon is doing a preorder for the Intel version of these laptop Im tempted but I feel like I should wait for the AMD version",
  "aajeev wow really Can you please send the link",
  "aajeev Thanks a lot man For real Ill check it out",
  "ItsNicolau No problem",
  "Glad it worked out Leslie",
  "My internal Josh says 14 is a barbie size Make sure you buy it in pink color",
  "are you satisfied with the product I bought the same couple of days ago and its great the only thing that concerns me is the heating in the middle of the keyboard",
  "stevanstojanovic3278 yeah I am satisfied I have also noticed some heating especially if the laptop is on my lap so I try to make sure it is on a firm surface with proper gap on bottom for air To make sure cooldown works The heating is mildlt annoying though but that is the only downside so far great product otherwise",
  "santels2345 I agree on a great laptop and yea bit annoying but we can always buy a cooler for such a powerful CPU you must sacrifice somethingBTW for this CPU 5800H temps can go maximum 105 C 52C is normally light load 7080 C medium load personaly tested Ive read about someone said that the speakers are not good and thats so not true I found them very nice I bought it in Serbia for 1100k euros and am super satisfied I will use this laptop for programming Thanks for fast answer Santels CHEERS",
  "Yes that is true it is a powerful cpu so it is understandable that it heats I got it for under 1000 euros because of student discount so a great value for that prize And the speakers are good in my opinion too and the display is awesome",
  "Hi ur the most underrated tech speaker",
  "Last year I got lenovo ideapad 5 14 amd ryzen 7 version based on ur recommendation",
  "Hi Josh great review as always I would like to see the 14 version of the Ideapad 5 pro cause Im planning to buy it",
  "Looking forward to a 3050 or 3050 ti variant great video thank you",
  "It also makes my mum very happy thats adorable",
  "Really thinking about this laptop for school I like bigger laptops being able to see more information on screen and run apps side by side The resolution on this thing is perfect and I love the 120hz even without the gaming aspect phone manufacturers have figured this out now Then there is the added bonus of being able to comfortably run a game when I want to Im sure battery life will be perfect if you run it on battery saving mode with the screen at 60hz",
  "This laptop was the all around winner for me Packs a punch but is also lightweight",
  "I have been waiting for a review on this laptop Thank you Dig your channel",
  "Great review as always Josh Love the way you tell it as it is and call out manufacturers on their shortcomings even when they send you products to review I find many other reviewers simply suck up to manufacturers Ive been waiting for this laptop since it was announced Itll be tough to decide between the 14 and 16 versions I like that you consider number of visible lines in excel to determine productivity benefits Will it not help to mention the laptops dpi as this contributes to how clear the text would when scaling is applied",
  "Im looking at the lenovo ideapad 5 15 at their official website and after discounts it will be 645 It is the one with the ryzen 7 5700u 16 gb ram 512 gb ssd and 1080p ips lcd 300 nit display Thanks to your review i am considering it Unfortunately the ideapad 5 15 pro seems to be discontinued It also seems like they have a 14 ideapad 5 pro model coming soon tho",
  "Great review Josh Cant wait for this to hit NA market The RTX 3050 variant of IdeaPad 5 Pro 16 has released in other markets It is a 55W RTX 3050 which is roughly equivalent to GTX 1660Ti Max Q performance That is quite a stepup compared to GTX 1650 In addition there is an 14inch variant of IdeaPad 5 Pro in other markets with R55600U MX 450 2K screen for sub 1000 USD This is incredible for a lighterportable machine that delivers great performance",
  "The idea of budget other reviews they are described as 500800 then there was finally a review for sub 500 as budget it felt begrudgingly done when we are looking at budget we dont expect to get everything folks looking for budget really do place price value for money spent as primary factor any suggestion to try to save to buy a device in the higher range takes away from the spirit of endorsing budget and now with a title of best BUDGET the previous range of budget 500800 has increased to 1000 just 100 more is actually 100 more not a small amount budget means budget it doesnt mean twice budget which I would say is less than 500 These review are very thorough and I do appreciate the information and the way the information is presented is top notch My only wish is that there was a clear definition of budget that does not look to upsell out of the category",
  "I was ready to regret my purchase of the Yoga Slim 14S but I HATE the numpad and absolutely will not buy any laptop with it so Im glad to not feel bad about it haha Anyway great review as always Josh",
  "Yo Josh luv ya been here since the beginning but never really commented",
  "U helped me lot U deserve more subs Cause I want a laptop with good built andnwith avg graphics to play eSports and with this review u nailed it",
  "This laptop is so good i could cry",
  "This guy deserves to get a million subscribers",
  "You give me a super vibe with your reviews",
  "Just Purchased this Thanks for the great Review",
  "Lliked the video for your mum Regards to her and hope she is healthy and happy",
  "Central Based Agency so what do you have to add to to the subject other than trolling",
  "Did he say this was a budget device I thought he said this was the expensive version of a budget laptop which would make this a midrange laptop",
  "I would really like to see an update for college students in need of a laptop for 2021",
  "i7 11370H half the performance of the 5800H in multithread workloads and higher temperatures Great work Intel",
  "Josh ur my favorite tech reviewer you come across as very honest",
  "I think i will buy this",
  "Your video never disappoints Josh",
  "Just Josh please do a review of the Legion 5 Pro Cant wait for your deep indepth review Love you reviews and thanks for making them",
  "Most of the reviewers need to test the wifi card speed as well Some of the top laptops come with cheap realtek cards which perform poorly Consumers forget about this and buy laptops based on cpu gpu thermals and display But without a good wifi card the laptop is just futile I kindly request you to add the analysis of wifi speeds as well Besides this your reviews are impeccable",
  "Imagine my surprise seeing your face 15 years later mate I remember a time where you spun uplifting trance and played a violin in Sydney clubs",
  "Anyone else got the 14 version Loving the performance and keyboard The track pad feels very budget imo tho and when maxing the speaker it makes a subtle screeching sound",
  "Good one Buddy Informative Just the things I wanted D Thanks",
  "This is what I wanted the Surface Laptop 4 to be Looks like Lenovo really delivered here",
  "He sounds like he was the guy who built those laptops But I have a problem my mic recording and camera for Lenovo Ryzen 5 arent very satisfying The sound quality sounds like theres echo and I dont know how to make is clearer Theres no option for me to change mic boost or disable noise from other people talking",
  "One day One day my brother we will get that usb4 on amd models Be patient and may the force be with you",
  "Subscribed Great content on your channel",
  "Excellent review Keep it up Josh",
  "Beautiful review very helpfuli have been looking for a laptop with this exact specs and here we are the lenovo ideapad proryzen model wins my choice as it has everything i needi cannot wait for this to release in the region where i live very nice review and now i really want this laptop hehe kudos to josh",

  "Amazing video bud stay safe bud",
  "Hey josh please review asus zephyrus G14 2021 There are a lot of reviews but you are the most trustworthy person on YouTube",
  "I have been planning to buy m1 air 16GB for my CS degree but then Josh decided to drop this Now Im confused The specs look superb in the Ryzen variant If they launch this with 16GB within 1000 price point maybe Id reconsider Thank you Josh for another awesome vid",
  "I bought the IdeaPad 5 from 2020 because of you and your are telling me that I need to buy a new one That Ryzen looks amazing",
  "I always love your review",
  "Can you mention which track pad drivers do the laptops have Not just in this video but in general it would be a good thing if you include that when reviewing a laptop",
  "Damn such a good review Just what i was looking for",
  "Awesome review as always Great works sir",
  "My favorite tech YouTuber keep up the great work Josh",
  "I think Im going to get this I am going to use it for strictly music recording With the AMD processor and 16 gb will be more than enough for what I do Im currently using an Asus Vivobook 15 with Ryzen 3 and 12 gb and it gets the job done I can only imagine the upgrade with this laptop I dont need a good graphics card just RAM Cores and Storage",
  "Do you know when itll be released I need a laptop right now im waiting for this now my parents wanted to buy me a laptop but im sure theyre not gonna wait months on end for this to release",
  "squadxgameislife2951 Im in the same situation lol a few regions have it out already like france and the philipines if im not wrong so its probably coming out soon",
  "The version with 5800h gtx 1650 and 500gb ssd cost 850 here",
  "cu3d its not the price its the release date when will it be released goddamnit",
  "squadxgameislife2951 Um its already released I get mine in 2 weeks with 1650 and 5800h",
  "prof1crl which country do you live in do you know how much it would cost in singapore or could you help a little please thank you",
  "squadxgameislife2951 Germany I used a website for students called campuspointde but I am sure if they have it others will too For SG sadly I am not sure Also the campuspointde says that the RTX 3050 version should come in January 2022 if you can wait",
  "prof1crl fuck man jan 2022 Shittt Do you know any other good laptops in the same budget range Which have like a good design and not too bulky like a gaming laptop and like good gpu and cpu with a good screen if you know what i mean",
  "squadxgameislife2951 The one from the video if you can find it Other good depend on the budget Lenovo Legion 5 Pro is a gaming laptop but not super heavy with QHD screen 5800H and 3060 or 3070 Other good ones are Dell XPS but a bit pricey LG Gram is also great but lacks dedicated graphics and you also have some really good laptops from HP",
  "squadxgameislife2951 Im from Singapore too mate not sure when its gonna release Ive been in contact with Lenovo and they cant give a date but they said itll be soon",
  "Ah im waiting for the new version for 2021 When it comes out ping me and ill get it",
  "JustJoshTech you can count on it",
  "wht did u buy btw just curiois",
  "Based on ur review i bought lenovo idepad 5 14 amd and its really good",
  "This laptop has a 5600u mx450 version here in the Philippines this review gave me a bit of a better perspective on expectations though",
  "This will be my next techpurchase",
  "Very details explaination I am planning to change my daily driver from ZenBook pro duo 2 to IdeaPad was confused with the and and Intel chipset And now I know that the AMD version doesnt support thunderbolt 40",
  "T14s gen 2 is out Looking forward to your review",
  "I am so glad you did this review Lenovo was supposed to release this laptop and I was very hyped to buy it but had to settle on the XPS 15 9500 after waiting for months Glad to know what Ive been missing out on I still choose the XPS for its speakers color accuracybrightness and chassis",
  "Great review Could you do a review on the Thinkbook 16p gen 2 It has amazing specs with Ryzen 5000 series RTX 3060 Max Q",
  "I have seen your most of the reviews They are detailed and great Thanks for such a great review I am requesting you to please review dell inspiron 7415 2 in 1 ryzen 5000 series",
  "Tempted to get the Ryzen model with a 3050 instead of a Legion 5 Pro or Legion 7 I dont play games that often anymore but when I do a 3050 may be sufficient for the handful of games I do play when I have time And IdeaPad it wont be as unwieldy as a Legion gaming machine Nice job on these Lenovo and thanks Josh for the preview on these machines",
  "This video just came 1 week late for me But this is best info we get here Keep it up please",
  "sold me on the 1610 aspect ratio",
  "Very detailed review",
  "Thanks Josh I have bought this laptop after I watch your review I am using it for programming and it is working good Guys I recommend you to buy this laptop",
  "Awesome video Josh Any tips on how to cleanmaintenance a laptop 3 thanks in advance",
  "And here I am with my modded XPS 9700 w 10875H and I still need 90W of juice to get 10800pts in Cinebench R23 Ryzen 5000 series is just on another level",
  "The performance section just showed to me that if you dont need maximum performance the 14 inch HP envy is the one to get Its crazy how that mid range i5 is keeping up with an intel chip that is geared for more performance Honestly if you are getting an 11th gen intel chip the i5 with 16 gigs is the best bang for your buck config with how it can be a tossup with laptop manufactures configurations",
  "Thats a sick review and a sick laptop Love IT",
  "Man You are by far the most refined laptop reviewer Ive seen on YouTube Good work Quick question I have to buy a new laptop max budget 1000 USD Heavy office work some analytics work and 1080p video editing are some of my use cases Ive pinned down base model M1 air What do you suggest",
  "Hey Josh big news from hp Seems like they listened to their issues for the pavilion line their new 13 inch laptops will contain a 400 nit screen with the 5800u processor AND a 1610 ratio I believe All for 750 and its 22 lbs",
  "It was announced at CES in January shipping started in April So on shelf in June Blame CES for the pull to announce products early",
  "Whoa thanks for bringing attention to this model This one had slipped under the radar for me Looks very promising",
  "Legion Slim 7 shipping May 31st available in bestbuy 3050ti and 3060 Sub 17mm However it is 15 169",
  "barrierankin2234 Slim 7 is not gonna sell as much since they didnt make it a 1610 screen That was a mistake",
  "rudymoralesjr so 169 is the dominant panel in the industry 1610 is still relatively low volume this is why so few manufacturers have products right now but it is accelerating Check back in 2022",
  "Hi i want to buy this laptops but there are some questions that i need to get the answers Does it get really hot under heavy tasks How about fan noise I heard that these are the only issues with this laptop",
  "arekudjasewu47ruid Hy I have used it until now I dont hear any fan noise while I am working still now also I dont feel any hotness while I am using it In programming I have learnt html and css and now I am working on challenges and the laptop works good for me I havent used it for programming languages until now but I will learn after I finish doing the html and css challenges",
  "Now that looks great I will get one",
  "JustJoshTech its the hp pavilion aero if Im not mistaken And from the recent leaks you can open it with one finger",
  "Another great review Josh Thx Can you please review the Thinkbook 13s Gen 2 Preferably both the Intel and AMD versions",
  "Great review Thank you a lot Do you have any prediction how much a possible RTX 3050 would add to the prize I know its early D",
  "Whats the best laptop for college students this school year Its getting later into the summer and lots of people need to buy their laptops now",
  "Josh can you also review Lenovos Thinkbook Series specifically the 15p",
  "finally its here WOW",
  "Hey Josh we need a review for the msi modern 14 with intel 11th gen please Huge support from Lebanon",
  "Another stunning review",
  "Very good review I hope Dumbledore wont get upset with you for playing with Muggles tech",
  "Lenovo needs to make a this form factor laptop with Tenkeyless keyboard with a Ryzen 8 core clocked for efficiency and an rx6700M with SmartShift And it would be the best laptop on the market",
  "Thats a a very good review",
  "Josh thank you for the content Are you planning to review surface laptop 4 If you do could you please include overview of linux functionality on it Thanks a lot",
  "I really liked the video and i hope you and your mom are doing great",
  "THANK YOU JOSH NOW WHEN ARE THEY BEING RELEASED PLUS I AM NOT A GAMER SO which one is still better Heavyduty on work load Zoom conference More business less gamer BTW Loved the video This is going to be my next acquisition Whenever its hatched",
  "The 3050 model should be promising Even though it runs at 35w it has a superior encoder to the 1650 I wish they wouldve given these 16 models a 60w 3060 at the cost of running the CPU at lower wattage like 35w Asus has already managed to fit a 3060 in a 14 laptop But either way these are great laptops thats if you can actually buy them After waiting for the Legion 5 Pro for months still havent managed to find one even though other laptops with Ryzen 5000RTX 3000 are available Im convinced that decent Lenovo laptops with Ryzen 5000 and dedicated GPUs only exist in renders and Singapore",
  "Im seeing ryzen 6000 series versions of these I want to buy one but Im hesitant without reviews",
  "While it is nice to see the great benchmark results of the IdeaPad 5 Pro 16ACH6 featuring a GTX1650 this particular model has never made it to Germany The trend of Just Josh reviewing unobtainium continues At least in the last 3 weeks the RTX3050 variants have finally been listed by online retailers and are now actually in stock though somewhat expensive At this price I think the Dell Inspiron 16 Plus 7610 might be the better deal at the very least it offers userupgradable slotted RAM instead of the Lenovos soldered RAM",
  "Just ordered the 16 i7 one Super hyped yea it was released earlier",
  "As for the AMD model w 5800H CPU and availability in Europe and pricing Amazon Germany had it listed very briefly for about 960 EUR incl taxes one month ago but not on stock Since then the model has been removed from the shop and no other reliable seller has this model even listed Availability for Ideapad 5 Pro AMD and Yoga Slim 7 Pro listed for 999 EUR is zero",
  "Hi Josh I just watched your video the first time and honestly youre the best in giving reviews Can you just please give a review or at least a suggestion about HP 14s AMD Ryzen 75700U Pleaseeeee",
  "Hi Josh waiting impatiently for your Samsung Book pro 360 review thanks in advance",
  "where are u from And what was the price",
  "Could you share where from Thanks",
  "This device is not on my short list of devices to review Sorry",
  "Any possibility of making your videos ultra wide Also nice video bro And the new models look awesome I want 45watt laptop though from Intel Or AMD but we all know theres gonna be like a couple of them available Mmm back to the future I absolutely in love with those movies I wonder if we will get 6000 series in laptops",
  "You provide wonderful reviews Josh thank you Just wanted to see the thermal footage if possible of the laptops you review even using the thermal gun would help it is important to know if a laptop feels hot on the surface or the keyboard not just the CPU and GPU watched some more reviews and I guess the Ideapad 5i pro is told to be getting hot on the keys especially on the IJKM line of the keyboard maxing out at 50 degrees while rest of the keys are between 46 and 49 which really hot Is is the same case for the AMD variant",
  "Please take notes professional and creative laptop makers This is definitely a budget laptop and still if everything will be still true when it hits the shelves as it can be expected Has a usable webcam Not great but its not below the screen and its ok for zoom compared to my XMG Fusion 15 for example that paints me blue as a smurf so I had to buy a USB cam Has HomeEndPgDwn keys Ok it has a full numpad too but I dont know how many professional laptops leave out those basic keys that dont take up much space but their absence can be a dealbreaker to many Has 7h reallife battery life even on a 70Wh battery Having both integrated and dedicated GPUs theres no excuse for the atrocious battery lives we often see on high end laptops even with 90Wh battery Has a decent everything Not excellent but no BS like you shouldnt use the trackpad buy a mouse or you shouldnt use this screen outside Its a laptop not a desktop pc I will have to use it in various conditions Has USB charging even with dedicated GPU Its no rocket science the question is why dont all the professional laptops have it I use my dGPU like 5 of the time tops so for the other 95 I should be able to use a USB charger without battery drain Why have a sub2kg laptop if you have to carry another 08kg as the charger Oh and while were at it its a sub2kg 15 laptop with dedicated GPU Its a budget feature now Stop charging luxury tax for being light and powerful especially if you have a brick for charger The lack of upgradability is sad though but again budget laptop",
  "Upgradeable RAMs and itll surely crush the market",
  "Your way tooo goood",
  "I am really tempted to buy this one however the big issue is availability With the state of global supply chains and the popularity of this laptop I expect it to be very difficult to find one for sale especially outside lenovo main markets like the US UK",
  "Appreciate your work Josh mom please let him stay late at night to create these amazing vids",
  "I will be upgrading from my 4 year old med school yoga 720 to this as my primary residency pc I will miss my touchscreen though",
  "Josh excelent information Do you know about any refresh models for the Lenovo Flex series as well Thanks in advance",
  "I get a discount on Legion 5 Pro rn 1100 for R7 5800H RTX3060 upgradeable RAM better Keyboard build quality Heavier and less batterylife though Wonder what to get I am gaming but I dont need extra high settings and often playing indie games or modded minecraft So maybe an RTX3050 is enough Can get it on the ideapad and I appreciate longer batterylife of the Ideapad But I am also typing alot and the Legion 5 has very nice keyboard",
  "i would of love to seen a performance test when charging with 100 watt usbc because laptops are supposed to be portable Also I would love to see you stress the gpu cpu individually and together I saw some chinese reviews and the laptops cpu and gpu together output 45w and 35 w with a combined 80w",
  "Ideapad slim5 pro are like slim version of ideapad gaming 3",
  "great reivew josh and laptop now where do i buy one Kinda frustrating to see these new models and im ready to buy like yesterday and I dont see them maybe im blind I actually have the older 4500u on order but I want another one",
  "Thanks for sharing your insights much appreciated You mention that you wouldnt recommend this laptop for dedicated photo editing referring to the screen What if you use an external monitor instead Also which laptop would you recommend for dedicated photo editing in the same price range Thanks again",
  "Unfortunately the spec they sell in Australia has the AMD Radeon as standard and if I want the Geforce basic card like your spec I have to add 700 dollar making it close to AUD1900 which is no longer in the budget price range If the config is like yours and selling similar to the US pricing I will buy it in a heartbeat",
  "Glad to hear AMD will overperform the INTEL version Is this true guys lol nice video my dude thanksdecision changing video",
  "This is it This is the laptop Fix the webcam and were in the promised land",
  "Please review the Asus flip 14 tm420 the ryzen 5 5000 series Its very affordable considering its specs but Im pretty sure it has flaws and I know youre the only one who can honestly point them out",
  "Please review the hp pavilion aero 13 it just came out and i think it is the next best laptop for average people It have 16 by 10 below 1kg great price and amd ryzen 5 5600u zen3 based I hope you can further review this laptop as i finally find my ideal laptop period",
  "If i do cinematic ones then yes id consider it",
  "l1q yeah but no charge when both cpu and gpu underload right",
  "danny8911 with 100w PD adapter it will also use the battery to fullfill the power needsbut it drains really slow and there are also probably copability problems",
  "l1q ive found a good 100watt usbc charger for like 50 dollar so will look into it c thank you",
  "They are shipping now Cannot comment on US availability but in Europe Asia and China supply is coming in big volume In Europe alone 50000 are shipping this quarter",
  "I love the value Lenovo gives with their products but they really need to trim down their model lineups There are way to many SKUs and alot of what they announce never seems to actually come out or by the time the product you want does release they announced a refresh with a different name",
  "Great review Josh one thing Can you also provide screenshots of the CPUz SPD tab for the RAM so that we can see what the timings are whether they are in dual channel dual rank and maybe shots of the internals chips themselves so we can work out whether x8 or x16 chips are being used with such laptops with solderen on RAM Thanks",
  "Love your videos Pls review the acer swift 5 i5 11th gen",
  "Excellent review as always",
  "Excellent review thanks",
  "I really hate Lenovos website I hope they just sell them in Amazon",
  "It looks like Lenovo produced an astonishingly small number of these laptops The product page at lenovo says discontinued with zero customer reviews",
  "Oh wow this looks so impressive I wish they could get replaceable RAM in a laptop like this",
  "Thanks Josh for the comprehensive review Any ideapredictions on when this device will become available for the NA region",
  "Hi Josh why did you compare this computer to the HP Envy and the Dell XPS but not the X1 Carbon It wouldve been to compare these 2 since theyre both made by Lenovo and the X1 carbon is SO expensive now Thanks for the video pal",
  "Lenovo wouldve shaken the entrylevel content creation and gaming laptop market to its core with a 1200p120Hz100 sRGB display option Even if the response times were crap I wouldnt complain at less than 1000 USD",
  "Hello sir big fan Im requesting you to make a video about some budget laptop for using capture card and streaming on streaming platforms",
  "wowthats really a valueformoney device",
  "Very impressive stuff from Lenovo",
  "The Ideapad 5 Pro is already on sold in China under the Xiaoxin brand btw",
  "Can you review the Ideapad Gaming 3 in 2021 Because I really enjoy your reviews bro",
  "I wish PC laptop makers enable us choosing the keyboard with a numpad or without a numpad Ive never ever used a numpad but I have to have one which makes the keyboard of centered If you need a numpad just buy a bluetooth one you can place it anywhere",
  "Nice but I really dont like it when trackpads are not in the center",
  "Thats really one of the only ways they can force an user to upgrade from such a good laptop to another when they need more RAM They had to make a compromise somewhere No laptop is perfect",
  "So what you dont want 2560p you want worse",
  "barrierankin2234 I want cheaper Entry level laptop with DLSS for gaming and RT hardware for 3D renders for cheap",

  "Great video Josh as always Are you considering reviewing the 2021 version of the Yoga slim 7 pro with AMD 5000 series",
  "Great to see IdeaPad evolving except that atrocious keyboard design around the enter key they did it to save costs around manufacturing to fit different keyboard layouts as a result the German version of IdeaPad has this really slip Enter key which is barely usable In ThinkPads the Enter key on the Germany keyboard is wide enough to be usable but here in IdeaPad Lenovo needs to rethink",
  "A numpad is a deal breaker for me I just havent been able to get used to offsetting my hands to one side I wish we could do away with numpads on laptops and start selling cheaper membrane numpads for those who need it That also provides the flexibility to put the numpad on the left side leaving the right side for the mouse",
  "Fans josh Just dont forget them please",
  "This will be my gaming and productivity laptop if the intel version comes with Nvidia 3050 nottoobad battery life or at least a Thunderbolt 4 for external GPU The MX450 is just not good enough",
  "Great video What laptop would you recommend for work and also gaming under 1000",
  "Hi Josh first time watching your videos At first I was skeptical that I would sit through the whole 14 minutes but I was thoroughly entertained Quick question though The Ryzen version of the Ideapad 5 Pro seems to be highly recommended by you but would you say the same for the Intel version as well",
  "I bought the xps 15 7590 a year ago for 1300 with gtx 1650 this looks like a better deal even if it had the same price the xps gets worm to the touch the speakers are bad and the cpu throttling badly Next time I buy a laptop it would be after a recommendation from you",

  "Great review Josh and thank you so much for the lots of hard work you put in it does show Interesting how the midlevel of the notebook market has developed since a year ago obviously AMD has shaken up things quite a bit But I think there is one aspect that has not been explored in a really structured way by any youtuber The variety of displays especially highres higher than FHD I mean you put so much hard work into spreadsheets and graphics of performance to show 5 difference but those 5 have probably far less impact on how good is a machine than the whole display topic There is so much variety out there just look at the uppermiddle tier The Dell XPS with a IPS 4k and the new OLED 4k Lenovo with the X1 yoga that last year had a Dolby HDR 4k this year apparently no HDR any more is it a different display now which review can I trust now Then theres that super glossy 4k in the current X1 carbon Then the 25k IPS in the Thinkpad X13 yoga then the Thinkpad nano with yewt another display As a consumer I feel totally overwhelmed quite frankly 4k 3k 25k glossy abitlessglossy stilltooglossy reduced glossyness its midboggling I am currently looking for a unit and top of my list is the X1 yoga 4k but is it too glossy You rated the carbon 4k as very glossy but how does the yoga stack up in comparison I know this is a hard request because you as a youtuber not necessarily can choose what displays you get in your review units and I fuly acknowledge that you more than anyone I know online have already put in quite a few comparisons eg should I get 4k or not But is there a chance you could approach this topic a bit more structured Like really picking displays on purpose and trying to filter out whats noteworthy and what not Is there a way to standardize a measure of glossyness Like perhaps you set units up in a fixed always similar way with the same lighting situation each time and show direc comparison still images For me as a consumer it does make quite a difference to choose an X1 yoga with matte FHD or with glossy 4k its a totally different machine Probably more so than the difference between a X1 carbon FHD and X1 yoga FHD THAT difference I understand but whats it like to have the carbon 4k vs the yoga 4k Frankly this will make a much bigger impact on how good a machine suits me than 10 difference in performance or if its 2C warmer to the touch If theres any youtuber that can come up with a more structured solution to this my bet would be on you so I so hope this comes into focus a bit more Ok that was a wall of text above all Id like to thank you for your so very helpful and well done work Best wishes and best of luck",
  "I wish you have 1 million subscriber and more",

  "Great video as usual 3 Can I assume that the RAM is soldered",
  "Very helpful reviewI enjoyed itbut do you know anything about the release datesbecause lenovo is keeping quiet and just releasing promos and not answering customers question only on that topicIt is a pretty shady practice on their behalf but obviously theyve sent you one for promotional services So if you have any info on that it would be great Also I am expecting for your review on the Thinkbook 16p Gen2 Ryzen 9 modelwhenever they start selling it too From the specs it looks like a dope machine for creative professionals I need it because I study architecture and work in interior design Thanks in advance",

  "Probably it will go out of stock even before many of us realize that its on sale",
  "You cant go wrong with any If you want to do gaming get the IdeaPad Pro 15 If you need max portability get the mac",
  "Hi Great review as usual Do either of these powerthrottle when running on battery I noted with the Surface Laptop 4 with AMD that it reduces the performance by half when on the battery to achieve those battery figures I suspect Lenovo does not do this as battery life is average but it would be good to know I have found that the MX450 on my Samsung Flex2 is a battery killer with no switch to just using Xe a pain The nonMX450 version gets 50 more SoT I wonder if that is why the Intel version only gets 78h SoT running a video on loop There seems still no reason to buy the Intel version they are still playing catch up with AMD let alone with the soon to be released M1X Macs Sadly buying AMD has been a lesson in patience and TBH needs to sort out their supplyside problems They have created two great generations of CPUs missing out on millions of sales due to poor planning If you can find an AMD version it looks like a great option",
  "Really good laptop for students",
  "hope it comes to Brazil",
  "Im not sure why I guess I blame Intel but in the US Zen 3 based thinandlight notebooks have been hard to come by Im getting ready to purchase the Ryzen 5 version of the Ideapad 5 Pro here in November",

  "Can you discuss the reliability of these models over the years Also are they noisy I saw the comment about the 51 db and 48 db noise levels but I was not sure if it is an issue",
  "I would have liked to purchase the Ideapad 5 15 but in Europe at least in Hungary the only available configuration has 8 GB soldered RAM Pretty much the same situation with the 14 inch model outside of one place but that seemed fishy So for the love of God if the RAM is nonupgradable offer 16 GB variants if the Pro models are introduced to the market",
  "Please also review the recently launched Dell Inspiron 16 plus laptop",
  "Hey Josh Great review Waiting for these Is the 5600h better than the i7 or i5 in terms of performance Who should be using 5600h and who should be using 5800h Looking forward to your advise",
  "Would love to see a review of the new Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 in 15 with AMD Im torn between this one and the IdeaPad 5 Pro It is build quality and battery life versus performance I dont necessarily need the performance but its difficult to justify the Surface against something the same price but twice the performance specs PS yuck that webcam on the IdeaPad is terrible haha",

  "i cant wait for it to be realesed in my country finally getting rid of my 8 years old lenovo",
  "Trying to decide between the AMD and Intel version I understand that the AMD draws more power but its also higher performing If they were to perform the same low intensity tasks such as webbrowsing watching Netflix wordprocessing etc would the AMD then draw more or less power than the Intel Im asking since I heard you say that the AMDs got more done for the same power with current iterations but here Im seeing that they use more power",
  "Yeah it saddens me to see that thinkpads are not getting that love and competitive pricing nor display",
  "Im surprised about the fact that following the link in the description its taking me to a Lenovo page where this model is currently discontinued This video is only 4 months old and its about a model that its about to be released Is it really discontinued already",
  "The 14inch one has no thunderbolt as mentioned in your video unless they are misadavertising the specs A big shame as I was going to go with one",
  "Available now at Costco price 999",

  "sangfroid well thanks bruh",
  "Update bought the ideapad 3 gaming instead",
  "How do you like it Im taking to get the one from Costco as well",
  "aajeev The screen was the number one selling point for me aside from the 5800H CPU The screen is excellent and gets bright enough to use outdoors I never realized how pleasant a 1610 2K screen is The colors are also excellent I was pleasantly surprised by the build when I got it I thought itll be allplastic but its mostly metal The allmetal chassis feels like a Mac chassis its solid and tanky Battery life switching to Windows battery saver mode and Lenovos Vantage battery saver mode the system estimates about 9 hours at 97 but never above 10h In practice when using actively for web browsing video calling running productivity apps etc probably around 6 hrs I feel it could be better for a 75Wh battery with no discrete GPU Windows and the apps seem to be responding well In contrast Ive been trying some Asus laptops in the last few months there are occasional hiccups like when you click on a line in a text editor the cursor doesnt get there or it will land on a different line They also sometime take a bit a of time to wake up from sleep So far I dont have such issue with this laptop Overall Im loving it so far",
  "hazmat5515 thanks Im going for it Excited for the large 2k screen",
  "They have the 1650 and RTX 3050 models already Im buying the 3050 one",
  "aajeev My apologies I live in EU I thought they would be available there aswell",

  "vixaa damn that would be more appealing than just the Vega graphics I hope Costco would sell that version but it may be unlikely",
  "I would like to know that as well",
  "sangfroid as a Linux user there should likely be no issue Just make sure when you set up dual booting you dont screw up partitioning",
  "Hello Josh Great video as always Im looking for a new laptop which has to be 16 to 17 inch with high refresh rate plus point if I get a QHD display but I dont play games I will use the laptop mainly for productivity work and media Do u think this Ideapad 5 pro with ryzem 7 5800H with dedicated GPU is the best bang for money or is there any other budget alternative Thanks",

  "Dang an excellent machine",
  "Hey there I love your content and your reviews Should I go for the base model m1 MacBook Air the ideapad 5 pro R5 with gtx1650 16gb ram 512ssd or hp envy x360 13 R716gb ram 1TB ssd Thanks in advance",
  "Hi Josh Thanks for your continuous hard work with all your reviews Would you be able to compare this laptop IdeaPad 5 Pro against the Lenovo Thinkbook 13s Gen2 I think the Thinkbook might be a great laptop for most people too",

  "The laptop isnt available",
  "Hi Josh Please review Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 7i carbon",
  "Is this something thats expected to come out soon or is it going to take a couple of months",
  "Great review I have a question though sorry if I missed the answer in the video Is the display matte or glossy",
  "I have been looking for someone to ask him this and I believe you are the right one my question is as a software engineering in his first year would it be OK if I bought a Microsoft services instead of regular laptop You know I just like the shape of the services and how light they are I dont know if they can do what laptop does",
  "Thanks for the review I dont see the AMD version for sale anywhere Do you know where to purchase one",

  "Hello Josh There is a 14 version and what do you think about that Thank you",
  "Josh hello Please recomend the laptop with a good screen for photo and video editing thank you",
  "I am quite disappointed that there is no upgradeable ram in this This is quite bad since they users wont be able to upgrade the ram in a few years when more ram becomes useful It also forces us to buy the overpriced higher specd models with more ram Never the less I will be anxiously waiting for pricing and availability to be released since this currently on my short list of laptops to buy for college",
  "Yoga slim 7 pro amd or this",
  "Would you recommend this or the Yoga slim 7 pro I cant decide between the two",

  "So no slot for another M2 drive Kinda sucks on a laptop of this size 5600H3050Ti combo is tempting though Id prefer 1920x1200 resolution Honestly I dont need anything more than FHD on any screen below 24 inch I get the appeal of higher resolutions but if I have to use scaling to be able to read content comfortably it just doesnt make much sense Guess 515 with same specs and FHD screen would be better for me though Im not sure if Lenovo plans to have 15 inch models with dGPUs this year as 2020 only had low power APUs",
  "You say screen is 100 sRGB but you add a second after its not suitable for photographer because of its lack of colour accuracy It seams contradictory to me Can you explain since I was considering this laptop as a budget photo editing laptop Thanks",
  "For your battery test could you adjust the brightness setting to a fixed lux value You could use your phone sensor to measures it",

  "Hello thank you very much for this video Would you recommend this screen for people who want to do some photo and video editing I wouldnt do anything heavy or super duper ultra professional however colors are important to me What I like is colors in photos and videos which are as true to the real life view as possible so I dont imagine Id like to do much color correction but things like correcting brightness contrast some light photoshop work to remove a small detail and some light color correction perhaps are very much things I suppose Ill need to do I also want to go into simple logo design Ive never had a laptop or pc with such good specifications so I dont really know exactly what Im looking for as I lack experience but I was researching the ideapad 5 gen 6 with Ryzen 7 CPU and sadly however an integrated AMD Radeon graphics card but Ill look further for a one with a dedicated graphics card So basically my question is for such video and photo editing as I described do you think this screen is good When you said its not ideal for photo editing did you mean mostly so for people who do it professionally and do a lot of different kinds of editing of the colors Im not interested in video games however I am interested in multitasking and video and photo editing For example write my homework in WordExcel with a few Chrome tabs open while talking on Discord and a video is rendering I highly appreciate anyone willing to help me I have almost decided to buy this laptop Im only worried about the screen What do those values really mean 100 rgb accuracy and 82 rgb adobe accuracy If I use a different editing program could this inaccuracy be avoided",

  "jaimerodriguez1332 yoga slim 7 pro was never a model aimed at North America but it will be widely available in Europe Asia and China I am told by the US team Ideapad 5 pro 16 will be ranged on Lenovocom and Costco I believe but they are focused on the RTX 3050 model which has just launched Now here is the thing a manufacturer cannot force a retailer to range or buy a product Many retailers especially in the US feel touch based systems in this price bracket is what customers want So if you want products like this ranged from all manufacturerstell the retailers or send an email to the us Lenovocom store All the best",

  "Usercb4jm I agree Dell and HP even has apps to fill in where Windows AndroidSamsung etc left off You can use HP quickdrop as an airdrop alternative Plus MS Your Phone is actually very good except you cant screen mirror like on a Samsung phone And if you prefer something better You can use Dell Mobile connect or Alienware Mobile connect as a MS Your phone Alternative Plus you can control your entire phone even adjusting volume and installing apps from your PC if you know what you are doing The Samsung ecosystem is just not worth the money",

  "Damn shouldve found your channel sooner and bought a used Lenovo Slim 7 Pro instead of an Ideapad 14 Pro Not regretting anything its an absolutely amazing device and Im enjoying every minute of it but the Slim Pro with its fullclock Ryzen 7 5800H for the same price if used wouldve been unbelievable bang for buck",

  "I got one yesterday It is overall a really nice and well build machine but I cant calm down the fans especially during charging Even on battery mode with disabled turbo mode it also periodically starts the fans and stops 12 seconds later This is likely intended behavior by the vendor This happens on idle and when the processor usage peaks up shortly raising the temperature Not sure what to think regarding this and whether other laptops behave better in this regard any idea The touchpad is overall good but at the same time a bit cheap due to rattling noise even on soft tapping It seems to improve though the more I use it since the left side already definitly rattles less I have a weird issue which hopefully wont be my dealbreaker When I plug an USBC charger at the moment I did not try the original one my touchpad slows down with a noticable 500ms delay when moving around the mouse cursor The sound speaker is a bit thin Other than that it seems like a really nice notebook for the price but I eventually will need to return it if the touchpad issue remains",

  "How is the fan noise on the idea 14",
  "nemjht very quiet The fan control software is very aggressive towards being quiet sometimes to the detriment of efficiency games drop frames and yet the fans are on medium speed so the fans rarely reach high speeds but even at max their sound profile is more of a low hum so its not annoying at all",
  "antikovt thanks for responding did you need to use any custom settings for the fan control for the ideapad pro 5 14 or were the fans quiet on their own",
  "nemjht there are no custom fan control settings D All the user control is 100 extinguished from the system",

  "Hi Josh I think people asking about the Lenovo Slim 7 Carbon are generally from other countries outside the US where the product has actually been released and is available To be honest it does sound like the Slim 7 Pro or Yoga 14s but much lighter and possibly better battery life with the Uprocessors in the Carbon as compared to the Hprocessors in the pro",

  "theinktician Or if the XG Mobile didnt cost as much as the laptop",
  "bodhisattvaFM YeahI got the Flow X13 with 3050 ti by itself on sale and cannot justify buying the XG Mobile at more than what I paid the laptop for Waiting for it to come down refurbished or used to then get it",

  "Been checking retailers here in Finland daily since Id rather buy from a local company than from Lenovo Just last week the Gigantti chain added it to their website but it says that it will be in stock in July 2022 Lenovos own website gives 6 weeks plus as delivery time estimate The laptop seems to have everything Im looking for good build quality screen sound and efficiency",
  "AndreasGranqvist9105 delivery of my configuration was estimated for 6 weeks as well But I think it is worth waiting I think it is related to the global shortages and AMD availability",

  "Coming from the 18 mm key travel of the X220 X230 to 13 mm of X1C9 there is definitely a less feel in the keyboard",
  "vardanrathi7777 x1c9s keyboard is 15mm",
  "zhongtianye8400 The travel is 15 mm but the key caps are also smaller than say X1C7",
  "sorry to hear that",
  "What is the procesor in it",
  "Slim 7 Pro is a pretty popular laptop so you might be well off buying it used or in an opened box for the price of a new 5 Pro Thats what I wouldve done had I found out it exists before purchasing the 5 Pro lmao Not regretting anything the 5 Pro is still an amazing device and a joy to use",
  "You answer the question yourself Its way overpriced given the performance it offers Build quality cant alone justify the price Its like getting a nice car but cant run then whats the point Plus there are many many well built laptops from well known brand The Surface devices this year make Macbook look reasonably priced in comparison And Im a lifetime Windows user",
  "The Surface Laptop 4 is a fine choice but the hardware itself is barely updated past the original model Port selection is woeful and bezels comically thick with only a single USBC the trackpad and keyboard are good the build quality is fine but we have a Surface Laptop 3 at home and the hinge creaks loudly the display is nothing to shout about yes its higher res than 1080p but its bad next to a 2016 MacBook Pro from 5 years ago let alone the best XPS and MacBook screens of 2021 My main issue on the one is the very uneven backlight bleed from the bottom and the screen itself lacks a anti reflective coating of any sort and the fairly poor contrast My MacBook Pro 14 absolutely smashes it out of the water as expected Again its fine sort of like a Windows equivalent of a MacBook built from the same company that makes the OS But the Ryzen chips are a year old and the Intel chips arent great from a performance heat or battery life point anyway Youre probably just better off with a M1 MacBook Air that has better battery has better processor and graphics power and doesnt get hot at all underneath unlike the Surface we have that does even on light tasks It was a closer call before Apple Silicon but now why bother unless you have specialist software but for general use nah just get the M1 MacBook Air unless you specifically need a 15in ultrabook",
  "traicetea I think there is no other windows laptop with a similar build quality the xps is rly not my cup of tee with this carbon look The price isnt too bad I found the 13 inch one with ryzen 4680u 8 gb ram and yes only 128gb storage for 700 thats ok If u upgrade to 500gb its around 870 so The decision is windows laptop with less performance or macbook with alot of performance but macOS Maybe it was just a tough decision for me cuz I love windows so much and windows 11 also looks great",
  "I think Microsoft kind of turning into Apple but not in the good kind Instead of really improve the Surface product performance design and offer more value they decided to try to milk every they can from uninformed customers with underperformedunderfeatured products",
  "Usercb4jm I think there are upgrades to the surface 3 the bezels are actually smaller then the macbooks but ye still big for 2021 The ports are IMO better then the macbooks cuz i still use usb a from time to time More then usb c actually The performace was enough for my tasks mainly poweroint and excel and stuff So i care about the battery life which is rly good for a windows laptop and the build quality the keyboard and trackpad both were perfect betten then the macbooks IMO The price was 700 for the 13 inch ryzen modell so pretty fine But yea i agree that if one can to the change from windows to macOS the macbook air m1 is the better option which is why i bought that instad But still there are valid point to go with the surface IMO To your comparison of the surfcae3 with the macbook pro 14 well comon D thats not fair D When i compared the surface 4 screen with the macbook air screen i think the macbook has better contrasts and deeper blacks yes a little backlight bleeding on the surface But the 32 ration screen was pretty nice So just a small for the macbook IMO The Pro models have different screens and cost like 2 times as much D",
  "Im with you here I tried both the m1 MBA and the Surface laptop 4 metal version and although I agree with some of the comments re superior battery life and screen on the MBA I just prefer the SL4 To dismiss the build quality screen keyboard and trackpad of the SL4 seems silly to me the keyboard and trackpad is better than apples in the same way that people are hyperfocused on cinebench scores when the vast majority of people use ChromeEdge and Microsoft Office only for laptop use I tried rendering the same video with Adobe Premiere Pro and the mba took a minute faster than the SL4 in rendering Big freakin deal Also I just cant get into macOS I dont think the SL4 overpriced especially when you consider how much money people spend on gaming desktops andor building their apple ecosystem So I think Josh shouldve at least mentioned this laptop but I also get that there are ton of great laptops to consider",
  "jwadeallen4218 100 agree My main point for still buying the macbook was to learn about macOS maybe i can fingure it out I have a windows desktop pc anyway for most of my use Just needed a well build good battery life laptop for on the go and traveling",
  "MrSchafonator Guys this may sound funny but M1 macs dont necessarily have to be MacOSonly devices These days Parallels Desktop 17 offers such a great level of Windows 11 on ARM virtualization optimization that virtual Windows 11 environment on Mac has better performance than native Dell XPS 9310 And most x86 applications like MS Office CorelDraw AutoCAD etc run smooth and fast without any noticeable lag at all That being said we are approaching the state when Windows shitty quality ultrabooks will become irrelevant when next generations of Apple Silicon come to life even without bootcamp like on previous macs Heck its already unbelievable what virtualization on these macs is able to achieve these days",
  "alexmaxwell Thats a really good point and its something I really thought about I guess I just dont want to have to pay for parallels every year but the points you make are valid I was hoping that the bootcamp will become available after Microsoft ends their deal with Qualcomm but Im not holding my breath anytime soon If bootcamp becomes available youre damn right Im going to buy a m1 MBA",
  "traicetea Those are fair points and my previous comments werent directed towards you at all I think you make some really good points and I agree the SL4 isnt special I have the AMD metal version with 16GB for around 1100 bucks which is the same amount as a refurbished m1 mba with 16GB I think youre right that there are better laptops out there for that price objectively the m1 mba is a better laptop but I guess Im just too lazy to want to learn how to navigate macOS",
  "jwadeallen4218 Im glad that you agree Actually there is a single payment option and you get the current version and updates within it forever And believe me Parallels 17 is already very very good And yeah bootcamp would be perfect But still it depends on Microsoft completely",
  "jwadeallen4218 Very good point about learning MacOS Actually having to relearn everything from scratch may slow down your workingeducation workflow to the point you will lag behind every other guy in the class But we have to accept the fact that since you buy a single Apple device say iPhone you are already in the ecosystem In no way your iPhone will sync with Windows better than with MacOS So if you buy an iPhone get ready to buy a Mac and learn MacOS from scratch Its just as simple as that And yeah MacOS is limited as heck No professional enterprise applications basically exist for MacOS",
  "alexmaxwell Good to know about the single payment option Oh yeah I have an Samsung device so dont really need the Mac ecosystem",
  "jwadeallen4218 To be fair 2021 isnt a good year for Windows laptops Many are stuck with intel i7 quadcore CPUs priced at 1000 or above AMD CPUs arent perfect either The MBA m1 is priced so well or perhaps other Windows laptops are so expensive that they make MBA attractive Who could have imagined that Apple priced MBA M1 that well I wouldnt have been surprised if the MBA m1 started at 12001400 for RD innovation stuff Their iPhones are over 1000 for god sake I hope Apple silicon will force MS and Windows devices manufacturers to up their game and give customers better products Ill continue to stick with Windows so please Windows dont let me down",
  "traicetea hopefully yes But windows laptops are kinda stuck with intel and amd processors and right now they just cant keep up with apple silicon So its not Microsofts fault for having bad performance If you want high performance on a windows laptop you also need very strong cooling aka loud and thick ugly and well loud",
  "Usercb4jm Apple Silcon is a joke It does nothing to improve the user experience of 99 of laptop owners Unless MBs get a touchscreen pen support 2in1 designs etc they will always have 78 global market share Thank God for US government protectionism or their global market share would be under 5 And lets not forget all the classaction lawsuits filed against MBs due to crappy build quality and poor thermal design keyboard thermal throttling green screen connectiity cracked screens for this year",

  "Selahree oh wow This is awesome to hear Very cool",
  "JustJoshTech see how many ppl your helping josh Your doing gods work and Im glad I subbed to your channel I mostly listened to Dave2D but he or most other channels doesnt arent critical enough to call out the BS that goes with laptops these days when you actually GETUSE the products after buying them only to find out their battery life is shyt the Ram battery or WiFi card is not upgradable there is no Ethernet port to hook up directly with a wire to the routermodem if there is a problem connecting to WiFiand you need to continue working remotely and not get in troublethe laptops are too heavy to hold and carry around lack of proper USB ports for extended USB extenders for more connections when working without a nearby charging wall socket and need to rely on a power bank or want to work with wireless keyboard or mouse And laptops that dont support certain programs properly or at all ie MacBooks adobe editing printing to printers unlinkable on macs but can do so on windows laptops Etc Do Lenovo legions supporthave all these features Josh",
  "I also switched from a 15 to a 16 The display is so much improved That 5060 nits of additional brightness have made a huge difference in usability Id say the best way to think about the LG Gram 16 is that it is an X1 Carbon that loses some of its stiff construction to get a huge display and even more battery life",

  "Did you know that most people make at least one of these 15 laptop buying mistakes This ends up either costing them money upfront or it forces them to spend more money because they have to upgrade too soon Ive definitely been guilty of some of these in the past so I put together this video to help you avoid the most common laptop buying mistakes When people shop for laptops the majority of the time what theyre doing is simply comparing a list of specs and this isnt only true for online shoppers The next time youre at a store and you see someone looking at laptops watch them and youll see that theyre basically going from onetoone taking a look at the display and then just reading the spec sheets They dont type on the keyboard They dont use the track pad They dont play around with the brightness on a display and they dont pick it up to see how heavy it is Theyre about to spend some serious cash on a device they plan on using for the next bunch of years and they dont even try it before they buy it Now I know that not every person has access to every laptop that theyre considering but Id recommend that if you can try a similar model maybe with the same keyboard and track pad just to give yourself a sense of the ergonomics Speaking of spending money Another mistake that people make is overpaying for a laptop Look this happens with every product and if this isnt the first video that youve watched on my channel you know that I finish every video by saying buy it nice or buy it twice But that doesnt mean that you need to buy the most expensive laptop that youre considering If a laptop is more expensive because of a feature that youre going to use and thats going to provide you with value then by all means invest in it but if youre just spending more money on a laptop that costs more because that laptop is better then that could be a waste of money Now at the other end of the spectrum is buying the absolute cheapest laptop If its a budget laptop and it serves your needs now and in the future go for it but if youre saving 100 or 150 bucks now only to have to replace it in two years by spending 1200 bucks you actually end up spending more money If you watched any of my M1 MacBook Air videos you know that I do recommend that one even though its an entrylevel model but thats because I think for the majority of users the performancetoprice ratio is very high and most people dont need more power than the M1 MacBook Air offers The next mistake is one that Im guilty of and thats overlooking portability When 17inch laptops came out I immediately got one after seeing it at the store If you see my main workstation you know that I like a lot of desktop real estate and I couldnt wait to use the 17inch display Well guess what It was so heavy and cumbersome to bring with me that I never used it It just stayed at home where of course I was gonna use it when I have my main workstation available So think about where youll be using your laptop and then consider whether small and light is or isnt more important than a bigger machine Another mistake that people make is not considering the ports You need to look at what type of ports a laptop offers how many of them there are and where theyre located Does the laptop charge via USBC or do you need a dedicated power adapter that you have to remember to bring with you Is there a Thunderbolt port for faster connectivity or does it have an SD card slot so you dont need to remember to bring a dedicated card reader Think about what you plan on doing with the laptop and then what types of adapters or hubs youll need to bring with you for your workflow Accessories are great but you do lose some of that portability and convenience of using a laptop The next mistake that laptop buyers make has to do with storage So first I want you to think about how much internal storage you need and you can look at your current laptop to see how much youre using Then I want you to consider whether the laptop youre buying is upgradeable or not I think the M1 MacBooks are a great buy especially now but theyre not upgradable So what you buy now is what youll have forever Now some other laptops allow you to upgrade the SSD and Ram so you can make a smaller investment upfront and then later on when you have more money you can upgrade You can always supplement the internal storage with an external SSD but you want to make sure that you have enough internal storage for all your apps now and for as long as you plan on using that laptop The next mistake that laptop buyers make is becoming obsessed with one spec Manufacturers have become absolute marketing ninjas and they do an excellent job at making the buyers think that they need the latest and greatest feature They get it in your head you cant live without this one thing and then get you to spend more money than you actually need to So since we just talked about port a simple example would be a ThunderboltUSB 4Port Yes it offers higher maximum transfer speeds And yes it will allow you to use more powerful accessories like absurdly fast external SSDs but you should only spend money on this feature if you actually plan on using it otherwise youre just wasting money The next mistake people make is not buying enough power Were all on a budget Well at least most of us are and were always looking for a good deal but if the laptop you buy doesnt serve your needs now or in the near future then youre just throwing away money I get this question a lot like can I do XYZ whatever it is video editing photo editing whatever it may be on whatever laptop The issue is that most recent laptops can do all of those things You can edit 4K video even on pretty basic laptops using proxies But I want you to think about time and money If it takes me twice as long to edit a video because I have to transcode all the footage or because I cant smoothly scrub the timeline or it takes forever for effects to apply how many hours am I wasting by saving a few hundred bucks upfront Then multiply that by every video youre ever going to edit on that laptop and youll see it add up real quick Im only using video editing as an example but I want you to apply this to your needs I know I talked about portability already but now I want you to look specifically at the size of the display Depending on what youre using your laptop for if youve got a laptop thats too small it may be so frustrating to use that even though you can bring it with you you dont end up working on it So make sure that you get a display that works for what you need and at the same time try to minimize the weight by looking at thin and ultra thin options if portability is a priority If you just watched my comparison of the M1 MacBook Air and the Samsung Book Pro 360 you saw the both offer the ability to use a tablet as an additional wireless display If youre already bringing a tablet with you this lets you get by with a smaller display on your laptop because you essentially have a portable dual display setup The next mistake people make is not thinking about the future and only buying for now Now this is a doubleedged sword because I dont fully buy into see what I did there The whole concept of futureproofing but there are levels there When you put together your requirements think about what you need now and what you think youll need for the lifetime of the device Now this isnt the same for every buyer because you might get a new laptop every three years five years or 10 years but whatever that cycle looks like for you make sure that you get a machine that serves you well for that long Another mistake that some buyers make is thinking of a twoinone as a laptop In some cases its actually true like with the Samsung Book Pro 360 but in other cases youre essentially buying a tablet with a keyboard attachment Now in my experience the twoinone laptops that Ive used havent been as good as laptops in that same price range and they havent been as good as the tablets that I already own So you really need to make sure that you want that hybrid touch screen functionality because for the most part if youre looking at laptops at that same price point youre gonna be giving up on something Maybe its processing power and maybe its the quality of the display but something has to give because of the additional costs the manufacturer has to put into the twoinone Another mistake that laptop buyers make is not watching reviews Now there are a ton of reviews on YouTube so find someone who you trust and see what they have to say about the laptop that youre thinking of buying And dont watch just one watch a few of them It doesnt mean that you have to come to the same conclusion as the reviewer but if this is something that they take seriously they should give you a balanced perspective and it may cover some aspects that you didnt think to consider Another mistake that I see all the time is buyers that are blindly brand loyal Now I completely understand that theres some familiarity involved and assuming that you had a positive experience with a brand there is some trust thats built there but this shouldnt come at the cost of you doing your research What if this brand made great laptops at a great value five years ago but now its over priced Or maybe theres another brand thats putting out some amazing products and youre missing out because youve limited your research to one brand Take your time look at the pros and cons of a different few brands and then get the one that works best for you The next couple of mistakes have to do with the displays The first one might just be a personal pet peeve but I do not like glossy displays They initially look really nice at the store but then when it comes to actually using them in real life situations I always get frustrated Now this is where using the laptop at the store for a few minutes can really help you get a sense of what you can expect Now before I get to number 15 while I was recording this video I thought of a 16th mistake so theres one bonus one The next mistake that buyers make is believing that they absolutely need a very high resolution display Its true A nice 4K display looks amazing but do you really need one on a laptop If you do cool get one but otherwise youre paying a premium and your battery life will suffer The last mistake is one that I see all the time and it just makes me shake my head Now Im talking about people who buy a laptop based on other peoples needs When youre either watching a review or accepting a recommendation from someone make sure that theyre addressing your specific needs There are some amazingly powerful gaming laptops out there but if you need portability more than you need power then its not the right fit Just because a laptop has better features doesnt mean that its a better value for your needs Whats right for someone else might not be right for you So please do your best to make an informed decision based on what you actually need Hopefully this video is helpful Click on my face to subscribe and then watch one of these videos You know what I always say buy at

  "Thats true Lol Because of that I adapted to researching models online from the store I usually shop at then look at couple other stores and research their models watch video reviews etc then go in to the store to play with the options Ive narrowed down Learning to do that has helped me make great decisions when purchasing tech or laptop and I never usually have any complaints after I have purchased I also dont have to rush to get a new product in a short period of time like some friends I know lol Its saved me a lot by doing that extra research that he talked about up front",

  "These are some really good tips for people in the market for a device There is SO much choice out there and it is very easy to spend your money on the totally wrong device I see it a lot with parents buying laptops for their kids etc In some cases I would recommend writing a list of 510 things you commonly do in a week on your laptop and showing that to a sales person and giving them your budget The problem with this is most sales staff on shop floors dont really know the devices they sell as well as they should and will make a lot of incorrect assumptions",

  "I love glossy displays and Id take one over matte any day Even in a bright office glossy displays work fine in my experience It is only really outdoors that they become a problem The best compromise though are the semiglossy displays that have a very slight antireflective coating that doesnt mess up the image the way matte displays do I cant see the point in paying for a fancy high resolution display with excellent colour reproduction and then wrecking it with a matte coating In my opinion the first thing to do is figure out your price ceiling then only look at models that are less than that amount Otherwise you risk the lure of just this one more feature and just that one more feature and before you know it your price is far more than you intended",

  "Just buy a maxed out XPS 15 the newer ones are very powerful and performance in games are very playable maybe not got making videos but for casual gaming or on the go it will do the job flawlessly",
  "onemangamer587 yeah probably the better choice Ill probably go for the 17 inch one though because the screen is a bit bigger and more convenient for photo editing Downside being its a bit bigger for traveling but Ill think it through",
  "skullwidget6958 Thats actually why I first recommended the 15 inch because if youre traveling the 17 inch one might be too much its not impossible to travel with a 17 inch laptop but Im sure on a plane a train or in a coffee shop or fast food restaurant it could take up too much space on the little amount of surface you will have But the advantage of the maxed out XPS laptops are that they are touchscreens so you can still use it while taking up less space cause you can hold it in your hands just like a tablet But the choice is up to you mate I just hope you choose the one that suits best your needs",
  "onemangamer587 well I get what you mean but the xps line is relatively small especially with the new screen ratio being higher The 17 inch is more like a normal 15 and the 15 more like a 14 but Ill go into a store to see them in person Thanks a lot for your ideas Btw I would probably not go for the maxed out version but the mid spec version",

  "Yeah I agree overpaying for a laptop is probably a very common thing however can we all agree that the price of laptops is beyond extreme I get why some are expensive but even the simplest of ones are too much in my opinion I also think ports are very important I love having an HDMI and DVD player in my laptops It has to have at least two USB ports and at least one HDMI port",

  "I am in general pleased with my new laptop However it has some problems 1 Randomly closing and remounting SD cards and USB memory sticks without unmounting the file system This guarantees that an SD card or USB memory left mounted for more than a few WILL be corrupted You think formatting it with NTFS a journaling filesystem will allow Windows to fix the corrupted file system THINK AGAIN Windows cannot fix this drive 2 Mouse buttons are underneath the trackpad This makes it impossible to point the device with any precision because the cursor will move a little when you press the button This is my third laptop with a 17 inch display and every laptop has been lighter than the one before it I guess I have the go big or go home philosophy when it comes to screen size My current laptop is amazingly light and thin",

  "Usage and software matters to chose the specs but money is often the deciding factor Many if not most people would be fine with basic laptops anyway but they want to show off the latest product with some new spec they need that latest MacBook or GPU I suppose you are doing some design because personally I dont see any use for the touchscreen on my laptop except with detachable or 360 foldable screen maybe My 8 years old Acer Aspire Nitro 15 that I used as a main desktop just died I dont really need a tower and I want something that I can take with me so lighter would be great but mostly a nice matte display with good color coverage and reproduction 32 Gb and 1 Tb most demanding task is photo editing no gaming no video editing or rarely I wanted 1516 but I finally chose the small Acer TravelMate P6 11 kg only 14 will this be enough time will tell I have a larger screen at home that was seldom necessary with the 156 for websurfing or office work maybe more frequently now with a 14 I usually spend a few days looking at the offer comparing specs in this case notebookcheck dot net laptopmedia dot com its not an easy task considering that hardware is changing every day Most of the time you wont find the latest or local version on these websites About reviews I agree that they are often misleading I suppose only enthusiastic youtubers get free laptops to test Reading comments from real users can be more informative but you have to analyze a lot of them Just now I was looking at the Yoga SlimPro 7 light gpu good display cheaper and better specd than my TravelMate I was geting buyer remorse 10 hours battery life announced by all reviews yet many users complain about only 34 hours with basic tasks and energy saving mode Same complaints about fan noise hard to tell what can explain such a difference",
