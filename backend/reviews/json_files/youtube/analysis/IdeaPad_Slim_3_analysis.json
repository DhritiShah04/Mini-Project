        "after using literally the same design for nearly a century Im sure this new 2023 Lenovo IdeaPad 3i has a all new design cant wait to see it oh no no no please be a different design please be a different design please you just had one jobs Noble you just had to change the design whats this theres something in here fair enough I suppose foreign if it aint broke dont fix it quite literally as they have not changed the physical appearance of the IdeaPad 3 Series for quite some time now the good news here is that they have refreshed it with the latest internals and so this model right here is rocking Intels 13th generation 1350 new series I3 chip with 6 physical cores we also have a 512 gigabyte solid state drive to my surprise we have LP ddr5 memory with 8 gigabytes total over here we also have Intels UHD Graphics furthermore we have WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5 on board and finally this is a 15 inch full AC display and it comes with Windows 11 now while not a whole lot has changed on the surface there are a number of notable changes on the inside and a few physical ones as well at that so were gonna go through all those in full detail and give you guys all all the information you need lets get started in terms of packaging content you can expect a very primitive cardboard box here with the basic Lenovo branding but again its a budget series laptop now inside behind a ton of protective packaging you will of course find the Lenovo IdeaPad 3i itself its a price surprise it looks very familiar to previous models past that you do have a 65 watt charging adapter and it is worth noting unfortunately you do not get USBC charging out of the box even with the latest 2023 variant you also have the wall outlet charging cable piece and then finally you have the documentation now at first glance the IdeaPad 3i really has not changed all that much like I mentioned everything from the straight linear edges to its Conservative Business Like design all remain very much the same they even offer the same Abyss blue color we saw with the previous generation however technically speaking this laptop is 10 percent Slimmer than the previous iteration a change again you can really only notice if you keep the old one next to it now with that said this laptop does have a full plastic build from top to bottom so you wont get any premium feeling or looking elements however it does have a modest weight of 352 pounds making it light enough for a 15 inch laptop to carry around starting with the top side like I mentioned you have a Simple and Clean textureless plastic finishing over here it doesnt feel cheap or finicky but its nothing really to glance at either though that Abyss blue color does have a nice unique touch to it and then of course you have some basic Lenovo branding on the sides of this laptop is where you will find all the i o Port diversity so on one side you have the DC charging port you have a USB a super speed Port you do have a rather dated HDMI 14 port a very primitive USBC gen 1 Port a headphone jack now on the other side one more usba Super Speed port and to my surprise you have a fullsize SD card reader which is always a welcome addition but as you can see that poor diversity hasnt really improved all that much but I suppose for a laptop of this caliber its fair enough the bottom side of the laptop also has a plastic finish like the rest of the body you will notice you have a nice long linear air intake vent though its worth noting that you only have one cooling fan so a lot of it is just for I guess dramatic effect but aside from that theres really not a whole lot more to see at the bottom aside from rubber grips to keep the laptop in place upon unfolding the laptop you will find a decent sized amount of palm rest space and of course its a full plastic inner chassis though its worth noting that Abyss blue color gives it a far more premium feel than there actually is now you have a surprisingly smaller trackpad than you would otherwise find on most 15inch laptops but thats not really a problem here because this is such a nice trackpad otherwise despite having a plastic surface finish you have super tactile clicks youll also find theres a very very limited amount of flex over here which surprised me honestly and the clicks are really well calibrated and tuned this is exactly what a nice track patch should be like even if it doesnt use fancy materials like a glass surface so I Gotta Give Lenovo full Kudos on that keyboards have always been my favorite thing about Lenovo laptops and this one right here is just as good as any other Lenovo machine out there if not better so you still have those super well labeled keycaps with a reasonable amount of surface area per keycap theyve also slightly improved the orientation of the keyboard to make it a little bit more user friendly you still have a full size 10 key number pad over here and the power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner Additionally you will also notice that this year to my surprise they actually include standard backlighting even in this base I3 configuration a feature that was previously only reserved for the I5 and i7 configurations thank you Lenovo for taking that feedback now on top of that of course the typing experience remains just as good as ever you have a generous amount of key travel every keystroke feels tactile yet firm and it makes for a great typing experience as you might have expected directly above the keyboard you will find a top firing speaker Grill and yes we will do a full sound test later on in the video now the hinge quality here is okay so you do have a decent amount of screen wobble and while you do get a full 180 degree tilt its worth noting that you want to be careful with the hinge as using it recklessly will undoubtedly result in longterm wear and tear damage display fitting is okay as well so you have a reasonably thin enough chin I guess its not super noticeable but its not super Sleek either the the bezels again are narrow enough for modern day display standards and then you have a average size forehead at the very top though at the center of it you have a 720p webcam something that did disappoint me as hoping by this point Lenovo would shift to a full HD1 but I guess somehow including a privacy shutter is supposed to make you forget about that fact if Lenovo could save the world by upgrading the display on this laptop I feel like they would just let the world end because we still get that same mediocre display weve been getting for years now so things start off normal enough with a standard full HD resolution you have a 16x9 aspect ratio additionally a standard 60 hertz refresh rate heck you even get a nice IPS panel with decent viewing angles now you only get 300 nits of peak brightness I know it could be worse at 250 but this display easily gets Overcomer when youre using it in bright daylight settings but the real crime over here by far is that 45 ntsd color rating or approximately 56 srgb rating colors look depressed on this thing they need therapy literally if you are using this for Microsoft Excel youre not gonna care but if youre using this or photo editing or any other color sensitive activity keep in mind this display is not designed for that kind of stuff and that may be a deal killer for some people performance on this machine is very impressive despite having a mirror useries I3 chip these 13th generation chips are no joke daytoday web browsing and watching video for example are all gonna be super Snappy as you might have guessed but even more demanding activities like programming or 3D modeling are not only possible they work well enough on a machine like this of course I would recommend a more powerful machine if thats going to be your daily use case and when I really push this machine to its limit by doing multilayer 4K video editing on DaVinci Resolve to my absolute surprise despite the limited 8 gigabytes of RAM I was still able to actually perform edits and yes there were occasional frame drops and it wasnt an ideal experience but it was ultimately possible something that I would not have expected with a chip of this caliber now in terms of gaming I was again pleasantly surprised games like fortnite can easily run on Lower settings at 30 plus frames per second despite only having Intels basic UHD Graphics again casual gaming is very much possible on here while this laptop may run fast it also runs pretty hot so under unrealistic Peak loads we were able to hit surface temperatures right around 44 degrees Celsius even sustained loads yielded around 40 degrees celsius which in my opinion is a number thats not very healthy for a useries I3 chip but what really makes me sweat is the fact that we were able to hit fan noises around 56 decibels despite having a single fan set up on this machine and to make matters worse the fan goes off pretty much anytime youre doing anything thats more intensive lets say running Microsoft Word now to be entirely fair this problem seems to be rampant across all Intel 13th generation chips they run far too hot in my opinion and can have repercussions in the long term so its not a problem exclusive to this model but that is definitely a concerning point over here you have a 47 watt hour battery on here which roughly equates to about seven hours of real world usage assuming youre doing mostly light load activities in terms of the sound quality you do have a top fine Grill like I mentioned its a stereo speaker setup but its very underwhelming sound theres not getting a lot of depth to it have a quick listen for yourself Music Music now based on lenovos website this laptop retails for approximately 640 US Dollars and if Im being honest that price might be slightly more on the expensive side for an I3 chip but in all fairness Lenovo definitely proves itself in the performance Department the 13th generation i3 chips are very powerful theyre doing tasks that I would not expect them to do like the ability to do programming modeling and even video editing to an extent aside from that I think lenovos specialty Remains the fact that it offers one of the best keyboard and trackpad experiences you will find in the laptop industry even at a midrange level that we see over here plus improvements like backlighting and slight revisions to the i o poor diversity definitely make this a lucrative laptop for productivity specialist now with that said the display remains as mediocre as ever if you are someone whos more on the creative industry this laptop might not be the best option for you especially when compared to Dells 5000 series of Inspiron laptops now with that said of course for General productivity I can wholeheartedly recommend this laptop and if youre looking at something thats not two or the top has a clean yet simple design lenovos IdeaPad 3 Series definitely hits all the right check marks in that regard let me know what you thought of this review and what you think of this laptop Id love to hear all your thoughts thanks again for watching catch you in the next one",

of it you have a 720p webcam something that did disappoint me as hoping by this point Lenovo would shift to a full HD1 but I guess somehow including a privacy shutter is supposed to make you forget about that fact if Lenovo could save the world by upgrading the display on this laptop I feel like they would just let the world end because we still get that same mediocre display weve been getting for years now so things start off normal enough with a standard full HD resolution you have a 16x9 aspect ratio additionally a standard 60 hertz refresh rate heck you even get a nice IPS panel with decent viewing angles now you only get 300 nits of peak brightness I know it could be worse at 250 but this display easily gets Overcomer when youre using it in bright daylight settings but the real crime over here by far is that 45 ntsd color rating or approximately 56 srgb rating colors look depressed on this thing they need therapy literally if you are using this for Microsoft Excel youre not gonna care but if youre using this or photo editing or any other color sensitive activity keep in mind this display is not designed for that kind of stuff and that may be a deal killer for some people performance on this machine is very impressive despite having a mirror useries I3 chip these 13th generation chips are no joke daytoday web browsing and watching video for example are all gonna be super Snappy as you might have guessed but even more demanding activities like programming or 3D modeling are not only possible they work well enough on a machine like this of course I would recommend a more powerful machine if thats going to be your daily use case and when I really push this machine to its limit by doing multilayer 4K video editing on DaVinci Resolve to my absolute surprise despite the limited 8 gigabytes of RAM I was still able to actually perform edits and yes there were occasional frame drops and it wasnt an ideal experience but it was ultimately possible something that I would not have expected with a chip of this caliber now in terms of gaming I was again pleasantly surprised games like fortnite can easily run on Lower settings at 30 plus frames per second despite only having Intels basic UHD Graphics again casual gaming is very much possible on here while this laptop may run fast it also runs pretty hot so under unrealistic Peak loads we were able to hit surface temperatures right around 44 degrees Celsius even sustained loads yielded around 40 degrees celsius which in my opinion is a number thats not very healthy for a useries I3 chip but what really makes me sweat is the fact that we were able to hit fan noises around 56 decibels despite having a single fan set up on this machine and to make matters worse the fan goes off pretty much anytime youre doing anything thats more intensive lets say running Microsoft Word now to be entirely fair this problem seems to be rampant across all Intel 13th generation chips they run far too hot in my opinion and can have repercussions in the long term so its not a problem exclusive to this model but that is definitely a concerning point over here you have a 47 watt hour battery on here which roughly equates to about seven hours of real world usage assuming youre doing mostly light load activities in terms of the sound quality you do have a top fine Grill like I mentioned its a stereo speaker setup but its very underwhelming sound theres not getting a lot of depth to it have a quick listen for yourself Music Music now based on lenovos website this laptop retails for approximately 640 US Dollars and if Im being honest that price might be slightly more on the expensive side for an I3 chip but in all fairness Lenovo definitely proves itself in the performance Department the 13th generation i3 chips are very powerful theyre doing tasks that I would not expect them to do like the ability to do programming modeling and even video editing to an extent aside from that I think lenovos specialty Remains the fact that it offers one of the best keyboard and trackpad experiences you will find in the laptop industry even at a midrange level that we see over here plus improvements like backlighting and slight revisions to the i o poor diversity definitely make this a lucrative laptop for productivity specialist now with that said the display remains as mediocre as ever if you are someone whos more on the creative industry this laptop might not be the best option for you especially when compared to Dells 5000 series of Inspiron laptops now with that said of course for General productivity I can wholeheartedly recommend this laptop and if youre looking at something thats not two or the top has a clean yet simple design lenovos IdeaPad 3 Series definitely hits all the right check marks in that regard let me know what you thought of this review and what you think of this laptop Id love to hear all your thoughts thanks again for watching catch you in the

        "after using literally the same design for nearly a century Im sure this new 2023 Lenovo IdeaPad 3i has a all new design cant wait to see it oh no no no please be a different design please be a different design please you just had one jobs Noble you just had to change the design whats this theres something in here fair enough I suppose foreign if it aint broke dont fix it quite literally as they have not changed the physical appearance of the IdeaPad 3 Series for quite some time now the good news here is that they have refreshed it with the latest internals and so this model right here is rocking Intels 13th generation 1350 new series I3 chip with 6 physical cores we also have a 512 gigabyte solid state drive to my surprise we have LP ddr5 memory with 8 gigabytes total over here we also have Intels UHD Graphics furthermore we have WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5 on board and finally this is a 15 inch full AC display and it comes with Windows 11 now while not a whole lot has changed on the surface there are a number of notable changes on the inside and a few physical ones as well at that so were gonna go through all those in full detail and give you guys all all the information you need lets get started in terms of packaging content you can expect a very primitive cardboard box here with the basic Lenovo branding but again its a budget series laptop now inside behind a ton of protective packaging you will of course find the Lenovo IdeaPad 3i itself its a price surprise it looks very familiar to previous models past that you do have a 65 watt charging adapter and it is worth noting unfortunately you do not get USBC charging out of the box even with the latest 2023 variant you also have the wall outlet charging cable piece and then finally you have the documentation now at first glance the IdeaPad 3i really has not changed all that much like I mentioned everything from the straight linear edges to its Conservative Business Like design all remain very much the same they even offer the same Abyss blue color we saw with the previous generation however technically speaking this laptop is 10 percent Slimmer than the previous iteration a change again you can really only notice if you keep the old one next to it now with that said this laptop does have a full plastic build from top to bottom so you wont get any premium feeling or looking elements however it does have a modest weight of 352 pounds making it light enough for a 15 inch laptop to carry around starting with the top side like I mentioned you have a Simple and Clean textureless plastic finishing over here it doesnt feel cheap or finicky but its nothing really to glance at either though that Abyss blue color does have a nice unique touch to it and then of course you have some basic Lenovo branding on the sides of this laptop is where you will find all the i o Port diversity so on one side you have the DC charging port you have a USB a super speed Port you do have a rather dated HDMI 14 port a very primitive USBC gen 1 Port a headphone jack now on the other side one more usba Super Speed port and to my surprise you have a fullsize SD card reader which is always a welcome addition but as you can see that poor diversity hasnt really improved all that much but I suppose for a laptop of this caliber its fair enough the bottom side of the laptop also has a plastic finish like the rest of the body you will notice you have a nice long linear air intake vent though its worth noting that you only have one cooling fan so a lot of it is just for I guess dramatic effect but aside from that theres really not a whole lot more to see at the bottom aside from rubber grips to keep the laptop in place upon unfolding the laptop you will find a decent sized amount of palm rest space and of course its a full plastic inner chassis though its worth noting that Abyss blue color gives it a far more premium feel than there actually is now you have a surprisingly smaller trackpad than you would otherwise find on most 15inch laptops but thats not really a problem here because this is such a nice trackpad otherwise despite having a plastic surface finish you have super tactile clicks youll also find theres a very very limited amount of flex over here which surprised me honestly and the clicks are really well calibrated and tuned this is exactly what a nice track patch should be like even if it doesnt use fancy materials like a glass surface so I Gotta Give Lenovo full Kudos on that keyboards have always been my favorite thing about Lenovo laptops and this one right here is just as good as any other Lenovo machine out there if not better so you still have those super well labeled keycaps with a reasonable amount of surface area per keycap theyve also slightly improved the orientation of the keyboard to make it a little bit more user friendly you still have a full size 10 key number pad over here and the power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner Additionally you will also notice that this year to my surprise they actually include standard backlighting even in this base I3 configuration a feature that was previously only reserved for the I5 and i7 configurations thank you Lenovo for taking that feedback now on top of that of course the typing experience remains just as good as ever you have a generous amount of key travel every keystroke feels tactile yet firm and it makes for a great typing experience as you might have expected directly above the keyboard you will find a top firing speaker Grill and yes we will do a full sound test later on in the video now the hinge quality here is okay so you do have a decent amount of screen wobble and while you do get a full 180 degree tilt its worth noting that you want to be careful with the hinge as using it recklessly will undoubtedly result in longterm wear and tear damage display fitting is okay as well so you have a reasonably thin enough chin I guess its not super noticeable but its not super Sleek either the the bezels again are narrow enough for modern day display standards and then you have a average size forehead at the very top though at the center

        "My laptop is mostly used while Im in bed watching tv propped up against pillows Back YEARS ago my track pad became erratic and almost unusable this wasnt this brand and I used an external mouse and since then Ive used external mouse regardless if the track pad works I remember not liking that feel at first but I had no choice I had gotten so used to it that when I got a new laptop where the track pad actually worked I wasnt happy using it that way and went back to an external usb mousewhich I guess its good It saves me from destroying the track pad",
