        "Ive been reviewing Lenovos IdeaPad 5 series for over half a decade And whether it sounds impressive or outright depressing Ill leave to you But what I can tell you is that Lenovo is not a company thats particularly fond of changing things up for no reason I mean this Idea Pad 5 more or less looks exactly the same as it did 5 years ago However with that said this is the most dramatic leap in terms of the internals that weve seen probably in the last 5 years from the Idea Pad 5 which is why I was super excited when I was reviewing this laptop Now the latest models we have here have multiple configurations The one here in particular is rocking AMDs Ryzen AI7 processor 16 GB of DDR5 memory AMDs Radeon 860M integrated graphics We do have a nice large 1 TBTE SSD We get WiFi 7 and Bluetooth version 54 standards And yes this is a 16in full HD plus display Now the IDPAD 5 is ultimately a midrange productivity laptop So well review it in that capacity But like I said a lot has changed on the inside and that has some serious implications in mostly good ways But theres also a few things to watch out for and were going to cover all of that in todays review So lets get into it Things are pretty down to earth as far as packaging is concerned We get a standard cardboard box inside it behind some more protective packaging Here it is the Idea Pad 5 And my goodness is that abyss blue color look appealing More on that in just a minute though We also did get a petite 65 watt charging adapter with a typeC interface something thats become standard with most Lenovo laptops now And of course the standard while out there charging cable piece for more extendability And then we get some basic documentation As I mentioned earlier the Idea Pad 5 doesnt really change a whole lot and thats true of this generation as well It looks very similar to the previous generation the one before it and the one before it and the one before it as well probably However with that said I do appreciate that Lenovo has perfected the cosmic blue color I believe in the past it was called Abyss Blue but really that blue tone with that dark finishing just goes so well with this laptop You do have a semi premium finish with a top half metallic exterior while the bottom third has a plastic finish I also want to mention that you get a respectable conservative form factor here that does great in both business and casual environments alike The laptop does have a modest weight just shy of 41 lbs which honestly isnt too shabby given youve got a 16in form factor Starting with the top side like I mentioned you do have a metallic exterior no rough textures Its very smooth to the touch and I love the high degree of fingerprint resistance You actually get a decent amount of ports with the AMD configuration So youve basically got a fully loaded HDMI 21 port You have two typeC ports with power delivery and display port version 14 and youve got the good old headphone jack On the other side you actually get two USBA super speed ports The only disappointment here is that you get a micro SD card reader rather than a fullsize one which kind of limits your compatibility and they definitely have the real estate to fit it here But other than that I do want to mention that the Intel configuration in the lowerend models actually has HDMI 14 so the AMD variant is giving you better IO ports right out of the box Bottom side of this laptop pretty standard stuff Youve got a removable plastic lid Youve got a long air intake vent here though half of it is pretty much fake since you only have a single fan setup on the left side And then youll notice you have no speaker grills on the bottom side indicating this is in fact a top firing speaker system Yay The moment you unfold this laptop you get an immediate appreciation for the metallic inner chassis with that cosmic blue color It is one of the finest color codings that Ive seen on a laptop honestly With that said you get a decent amount of palm rest space thanks to 16inch form factor At the center you do have a mediumsized trackpad Unfortunately it is a hollow plastic surface finish However despite cutting corners this is a very nice trackpad Doesnt have a whole lot of flex Its very tactile and very responsive Somehow Lenovo has managed to use cheap materials and get good results So its hard to hate on them The keyboard is genuinely a piece of work like weve seen with past models So youve got nice large key caps with easy to read and clear font I also appreciate the fact that you have a respectable backlit system here And yes you do get a 10 key number pad of the 16inch model so you can do your number crunching productivity However my favorite part here is the typing experience You have a ton of key travel a nice amount of tactility and a good amount of softness as well making this laptop really comfortable to type on for extended periods and often rivaling if not exceeding higher tier laptops like the Dell XPS and MacBook Pro for example Right above the keyboard youll notice you have a nice long speaker grill because after all this is a top firing speaker system As far as the hinge mechanism goes its not particularly great Theres a ton of wobble Its not the most durable hinge mechanism either So if youre not careful in the long term with the way you open your laptop there can be potential implications You do have a similar display fitting compared to previous generations So youve got a plastic encasing all around You have a slightly noticeable chin at the bottom though its not too dramatic At the side you have reasonably thin bezels allowing for an immersive view And then the top forehead isnt too big either At the center you do have a IR equipped full HD webcam system Its not really all that good It performs quite poorly in medium to low light settings though it does well enough in brighter settings Believe it or not Lenovo has been spamming the same display specs roughly for the past four years on the Idea Pad 5 and its getting a little out of hand with the base display So things start off nice enough with a IPS panel a 16in size as well as a full HD plus resolution that gives you a 16x10 aspect ratio But then it quickly goes downhill cuz you still get a base 60 Hz refresh rate And to make matters even worse you have a peak brightness of just 300 nits which is barely enough for a welllit room But anything beyond that you are going to get a ton of glare And the antiglare coating here is kind of overextended So instead of reducing and mitigating glare it kind of just spreads the light even more not helping a lot To make matters worse while you do have a very responsive touch captive system here you have a ton of resistance because of the way theyve applied the antiglare coating making it not ideal to touch with your fingers And the worst crime here is the fact that you still get a 45 NTSC rating with the base display in 2025 They should have been 100 sRGB as standard and why its not there is beyond me Now with that said it is worth noting depending on where you are you may have the option to upgrade this to a higher quality OLED display with a higher refresh rate as well as color spectrum rating So if color sensitivity is important to you definitely consider that option if its available A quick recap of the technical specifications on board So with this model we do have AMDs Ryzen AI7 350 processor We got 16 GB of DDR5 memory and also we do have AMDs Radeon 860M integrated graphics You can also downscale to a lower tier Ryzen AI5 processor instead which gives you the 840M integrated graphics And you can also get the IdeaPad 5i which has various Intel configurations You may remember earlier in the review I said that one of the biggest improvements with the Idea Pad 5 is the internal performance and I wasnt exaggerating So things start off pretty standard with general performance Everythings smooth whether its surfing the web or crunching word documents Advanced productivity like programming code compilation We had absolutely no performance issues or zero hiccups if you will and a great experience overall What really impressed me though was when youre doing 3D modeling and programs like Blender we had such a smooth experience It was almost unrealistic So as long as youve got a light to medium intensity model youre going to find that theres not a lot of frame drops You can actually add quite a bit and you dont run into any major limitations Something that would be absolutely unheard of a generation or two ago with the older Idea Pad 5 models Equally impressive is the fact that you can now do multilayer 4K video editing on Procast and Adventure Resolve Stack up to three 10bit layers without any major frame drops You can actually play a timeline in such a smooth fashion Youre like Does this thing have a discrete GPU It doesnt Its running off an introgated GPU the 860M But thats how far these laptops have come And performance here is spectacular to say the least Render times are also quite fast when youre actually trying to render all these 4K files at the same time Now gaming performance just as impressive Casual gaming is entirely in smooth experience Games like Counter Strike Goto for example can consistently hit close to 60 frames per second at high settings with the native resolution enabled showing you again just how far integrated GPUs have come compared to a generation or two ago And this is one of the best Idea Pad 5s Ive seen in terms of performance to date The IdeaPad 5 is one of the handful laptops that still allows you to get a respectable self upgrade option So you have two Sodium DDR5 slots which can be maxed at 32 GB of memory Furthermore you get two M2 slots as well Not one but two which means you dont have to replace your existing SSD You can just add a second one to double your storage And yes the connectivity module is also M2 based So if it goes bad or you want to upgrade to a more powerful WiFi system in the future you can do that as well Thermals for the most part are quite impressive So we found under a unrealistic peak load this laptop hit a average surface temperature around 39 C which is a full 3 cooler than the previous generation A more realistic sustain load however will yield you numbers of around 37 C which again is quite respectable fan noise is not so impressive So you have a single fan setup but despite that when you start doing medium to high intensity workloads the fans or sorry the fan quickly picks up and can hit noise levels around 50 dB which is quite loud So we get a mediumsiz 60Wh battery And while there are gains in efficiency you can expect a realistic runtime of 9 and 12 hours with a general productivity use case Yes benchmark will yield you higher results but a real world use case is generally a better indicator in my honest opinion Now as far as the speaker quality is concerned it is shallow While we do get a top firing speaker system which means good volume theres not a lot of depth theres not a lot of bass and even the highs arent particularly great Heres a quick sound test for reference Applause Heat Heat Applause Music Applause Music Applause With a 900 price tag this is probably one of the best iterations of the IdeaPad 5 yet Yes its true Its not a perfect laptop but you get a ton of value in the form of great performance hardware and IO ports with this machine The fact that you are getting highend productivity laptop performance at that sub 1000 price point in todays world is impressive and you know respectable in its own rights Furthermore youve got great port selection and the overall build quality of the Idea Pad 5 hasnt gone down something that we have seen with some other manufacturers Now the laptop like I mentioned isnt perfect You know the display is quite lackluster and the hinge quality is also quite questionable But despite these flaws from a general productivity perspective this is one of the best sub 1000 laptop configuration you get on the market right now And if theres one thing I can tell you about the Idea Pad 5 it might be a boring looking laptop but it is an equally reliable one and its one that I can wholeheartedly recommend in that capacity There are product links below if you are interested in learning more or purchasing this laptop And as always let me know what you think of this machine If you enjoyed the content please consider subscribing to our channel and liking this video",
        "My version of ideapad slim 5 slim 5 15arp10 has a nice 70wh battery which holds really well outside of gaming It has a ryzen 7 7735hs which isnt the most efficient nowadays but still holds well i can quite easily do 12 hours or more of streaming videomovie on a single charge",
        "Music all right its been a while since I reviewed a Fastback lit laptop and this year Lenovo did bring some new machines this is aapad 5 it is one of lenovos sleeker 15in laptops but there are also 13 and 17in versions in the idea pad 5 series whats exciting about this one is that it has the ryzen processor with a super fast RAM and SSD drive and youll see in a minute that it is far more capable than just for writing or watching videos on the web and it can be easily used for advanced creative work or gaming but like all laptops in this price category there is always something hidden until it bumps into you so lets take a look at inside the box so here is a charger cables laptop and is that all where are the papers uhhuh here you are I almost thought that I would need to guess how to turn that thing on the build quality of the Lenovo Idea pad 5 is a sophisticated Simplicity I think for a lot of people a good size and weight the exterior surfaces have this cold old metallic clean finish otherwise its got a standard smooth thin lid its not an extraordinary design but if you think silver color is too shiny there are also dark Music versions now when you pop it open the keyboard makes typing a very enjoyable experience and the buttons feel durable the tactile feedback is adequate and there is no visible bending going on around buttons even when you press harder on it for me a good sturdy keyboard is something thats really important because you cant replace it easily the keyboard itself can be bright especially if you have an idea pad with a white backlit keyboard so if you often work at night you will appreciate backl shortcuts but if you want more colors then you will need to check out Lenovo gaming laptops the touchpad itself offers a spaces interface with a smooth surface and good responsiveness its clicking mechanism is wellb built and it quickly detects touch when you press the top and bottom half of the touchpad I like the multitouch just dont expect miracles from it now lets talk a bit about the inputs Lenovo gave the idea pad 5 all essential and New Ports so on the left side of the notebook you can connect the two US USBC one is for charger HDMI along with a headphone jack on the right side we have two usba a and card reader on the top of the screen is a webcam with privacy shutter and it can easily record HD video If you compare it to the phone selfie cams it has average picture quality which is sharp enough for chatting of course you can even use it for creating short clips if you know how to upscale video quality idea pad 5 comes with an almost 16in LED backlit screen with a full HD resolution this screen does a great job of displaying web pages and YouTube videos it will be good for everyday use but if you want even better colors then go with the super IPS screen version with 100 color accuracy which also has a lot better viewing angles even though this IPS screen has average 60 color accuracy colors still look convincing of course its not all perfect like many other laptops in this price class it cant get a lot brighter than 300 nits which is not the best for working outside but its still usable and it still has more than enough brightness for normal use in the office or at home Music as you can see Lenovo outfitted the idea pad 5 with an improved cooling vents designed to keep the laptop quieter and less hot when it is fully loaded the device exhausts its heat towards the bottom of the screen during typing I didnt feel any heat but when you play games the left side below screen can become warmer yet its far from distractable unless you are ice cream if were talking sheer speed the SSD drive booted Windows 11 in an impressive 9 seconds in terms of upgradeability there are no free slots for ram upgrade but you can still replace the M2 Drive Benchmark wise it does quite stack up to the other laptops in this category it has a great CPU and a good amount of ram so completing tasks like programming application or basic editing of photos and videos is an easy thing to do for an affordable mainstream laptop designed for work and play the ryzen 7 processor performed well and without annoying fan noise when it comes to multitasking I tested some apps with YouTube in the background there wasnt lag when scrolling and switching between apps I also tested some games it ran smoothly Apex on High settings and I can say Radeon graphics offers good performance for most popular online games but if you want to play more demanding games like Battlegrounds then it is best to go with the GeForce GTX graphics with a 57 watt battery inside I wasnt expecting to be surprised on the battery test which involves some heavy editing gaming and watching YouTube the battery lasted more than 6 hours but it should last up to 10 hours and more if you lower the screen brightness to 70 and disable some unused background apps the two stereo speakers support Dolby audio and can produce a satisfying range of highs midtones that let you hear all the details and sound effects while only 3 Watts base is subtle it can still surprise in some clips and can perform well for watching shows in general speakers produce a clear sound and its peak max power is comparable with similarly priced laptops unlike a lot of 15 in laptops the Lenovo Idea pad 5 ab7 packs a lightweight chassis with thinnest bezels great keyboard and above average speakers the fhd screen is sharp the only disadvantages are the narrow color coverage so if you want more accurate colors go with 100 color gamut IP screen version as of the build quality despite the plastic around metal the laptop is robustly built and feels it will last the only complaint is there is no RAM memory upgradeability overall Lenovo IdeaPad 5 is still one of the best entry midrange laptops on the market and a great choice for anyone who want a fast and affordable laptop from Music Lenovo"

with some other manufacturers Now the laptop like I mentioned isnt perfect You know the display is quite lackluster and the hinge quality is also quite questionable But despite these flaws from a general productivity perspective this is one of the best sub 1000 laptop configuration you get on the market right now And if theres one thing I can tell you about the Idea Pad 5 it might be a boring looking laptop but it is an equally reliable one and its one that I can wholeheartedly recommend in that capacity There are product links below if you are interested in learning more or purchasing

        "Music all right its been a while since I reviewed a Fastback lit laptop and this year Lenovo did bring some new machines this is aapad 5 it is one of lenovos sleeker 15in laptops but there are also 13 and 17in versions in the idea pad 5 series whats exciting about this one is that it has the ryzen processor with a super fast RAM and SSD drive and youll see in a minute that it is far more capable than just for writing or watching videos on the web and it can be easily used for advanced creative work or gaming but like all laptops in this price category there is always something hidden until it bumps into you so lets take a look at inside the box so here is a charger cables laptop and is that all where are the papers uhhuh here you are I almost thought that I would need to guess how to turn that thing on the build quality of the Lenovo Idea pad 5 is a sophisticated Simplicity I think for a lot of people a good size and weight the exterior surfaces have this cold old metallic clean finish otherwise its got a standard smooth thin lid its not an extraordinary design but if you think silver color is too shiny there are also dark Music versions now when you pop it open the keyboard makes typing a very enjoyable experience and the buttons feel durable the tactile feedback is adequate and there is no visible bending going on around buttons even when you press harder on it for me a good sturdy keyboard is something thats really important because you cant replace it easily the keyboard itself can be bright especially if you have an idea pad with a white backlit keyboard so if you often work at night you will appreciate backl shortcuts but if you want more colors then you will need to check out Lenovo gaming laptops the touchpad itself offers a spaces interface with a smooth surface and good responsiveness its clicking mechanism is wellb built and it quickly detects touch when you press the top and bottom half of the touchpad I like the multitouch just dont expect miracles from it now lets talk a bit about the inputs Lenovo gave the idea pad 5 all essential and New Ports so on the left side of the notebook you can connect the two US USBC one is for charger HDMI along with a headphone jack on the right side we have two usba a and card reader on the top of the screen is a webcam with privacy shutter and it can easily record HD video If you compare it to the phone selfie cams it has average picture quality which is sharp enough for chatting of course you can even use it for creating short clips if you know how to upscale video quality idea pad 5 comes with an almost 16in LED backlit screen with a full HD resolution this screen does a great job of displaying web pages and YouTube videos it will be good for everyday use but if you want even better colors then go with the super IPS screen version with 100 color accuracy which also has a lot better viewing angles even though this IPS screen has average 60 color accuracy colors still look convincing of course its not all perfect like many other laptops in this price class it cant get a lot brighter than 300 nits which is not the best for working outside but its still usable and it still has more than enough brightness for normal use in the office or at home Music as you can see Lenovo outfitted the idea pad 5 with an improved cooling vents designed to keep the laptop quieter and less hot when it is fully loaded the device exhausts its heat towards the bottom of the screen during typing I didnt feel any heat but when you play games the left side below screen can become warmer yet its far from distractable unless you are ice cream if were talking sheer speed the SSD drive booted Windows 11 in an impressive 9 seconds in terms of upgradeability there are no free slots for ram upgrade but you can still replace the M2 Drive Benchmark wise it does quite stack up to the other laptops in this category it has a great CPU and a good amount of ram so completing tasks like programming application or basic editing of photos and videos is an easy thing to do for an affordable mainstream laptop designed for work and play the ryzen 7 processor performed well and without annoying fan noise when it comes to multitasking I tested some apps with YouTube in the background there wasnt lag when scrolling and switching between apps I also tested some games it ran smoothly Apex on High settings and I can say Radeon graphics offers good performance for most popular online games but if you want to play more demanding games like Battlegrounds then it is best to go with the GeForce GTX graphics with a 57 watt battery inside I wasnt expecting to be surprised on the battery test which involves some heavy editing gaming and watching YouTube the battery lasted more than 6 hours but it should last up to 10 hours and more if you lower the screen brightness to 70 and disable some unused background apps the two stereo speakers support Dolby audio and can produce a satisfying range of highs midtones that let you hear all the details and sound effects while only 3 Watts base is subtle it can still surprise in some clips and can perform well for watching shows in general speakers produce a clear sound and its peak max power is comparable with similarly priced laptops unlike a lot of 15 in laptops the Lenovo Idea pad 5 ab7 packs a lightweight chassis with thinnest bezels great keyboard and above average speakers the fhd screen is sharp the only disadvantages are the narrow color coverage so if you want more accurate colors go with 100 color gamut IP screen version as of the build quality despite the plastic around metal the laptop is robustly built and feels it will last the only complaint is there is no RAM memory upgradeability overall Lenovo IdeaPad 5 is still one of the best entry midrange laptops on the market and a great choice for anyone who want a fast and affordable laptop from Music Lenovo",

        "Ive been reviewing Lenovos IdeaPad 5 series for over half a decade And whether it sounds impressive or outright depressing Ill leave to you But what I can tell you is that Lenovo is not a company thats particularly fond of changing things up for no reason I mean this Idea Pad 5 more or less looks exactly the same as it did 5 years ago However with that said this is the most dramatic leap in terms of the internals that weve seen probably in the last 5 years from the Idea Pad 5 which is why I was super excited when I was reviewing this laptop Now the latest models we have here have multiple configurations The one here in particular is rocking AMDs Ryzen AI7 processor 16 GB of DDR5 memory AMDs Radeon 860M integrated graphics We do have a nice large 1 TBTE SSD We get WiFi 7 and Bluetooth version 54 standards And yes this is a 16in full HD plus display Now the IDPAD 5 is ultimately a midrange productivity laptop So well review it in that capacity But like I said a lot has changed on the inside and that has some serious implications in mostly good ways But theres also a few things to watch out for and were going to cover all of that in todays review So lets get into it Things are pretty down to earth as far as packaging is concerned We get a standard cardboard box inside it behind some more protective packaging Here it is the Idea Pad 5 And my goodness is that abyss blue color look appealing More on that in just a minute though We also did get a petite 65 watt charging adapter with a typeC interface something thats become standard with most Lenovo laptops now And of course the standard while out there charging cable piece for more extendability And then we get some basic documentation As I mentioned earlier the Idea Pad 5 doesnt really change a whole lot and thats true of this generation as well It looks very similar to the previous generation the one before it and the one before it and the one before it as well probably However with that said I do appreciate that Lenovo has perfected the cosmic blue color I believe in the past it was called Abyss Blue but really that blue tone with that dark finishing just goes so well with this laptop You do have a semi premium finish with a top half metallic exterior while the bottom third has a plastic finish I also want to mention that you get a respectable conservative form factor here that does great in both business and casual environments alike The laptop does have a modest weight just shy of 41 lbs which honestly isnt too shabby given youve got a 16in form factor Starting with the top side like I mentioned you do have a metallic exterior no rough textures Its very smooth to the touch and I love the high degree of fingerprint resistance You actually get a decent amount of ports with the AMD configuration So youve basically got a fully loaded HDMI 21 port You have two typeC ports with power delivery and display port version 14 and youve got the good old headphone jack On the other side you actually get two USBA super speed ports The only disappointment here is that you get a micro SD card reader rather than a fullsize one which kind of limits your compatibility and they definitely have the real estate to fit it here But other than that I do want to mention that the Intel configuration in the lowerend models actually has HDMI 14 so the AMD variant is giving you better IO ports right out of the box Bottom side of this laptop pretty standard stuff Youve got a removable plastic lid Youve got a long air intake vent here though half of it is pretty much fake since you only have a single fan setup on the left side And then youll notice you have no speaker grills on the bottom side indicating this is in fact a top firing speaker system Yay The moment you unfold this laptop you get an immediate appreciation for the metallic inner chassis with that cosmic blue color It is one of the finest color codings that Ive seen on a laptop honestly With that said you get a decent amount of palm rest space thanks to 16inch form factor At the center you do have a mediumsized trackpad Unfortunately it is a hollow plastic surface finish However despite cutting corners this is a very nice trackpad Doesnt have a whole lot of flex Its very tactile and very responsive Somehow Lenovo has managed to use cheap materials and get good results So its hard to hate on them The keyboard is genuinely a piece of work like weve seen with past models So youve got nice large key caps with easy to read and clear font I also appreciate the fact that you have a respectable backlit system here And yes you do get a 10 key number pad of the 16inch model so you can do your number crunching productivity However my favorite part here is the typing experience You have a ton of key travel a nice amount of tactility and a good amount of softness as well making this laptop really comfortable to type on for extended periods and often rivaling if not exceeding higher tier laptops like the Dell XPS and MacBook Pro for example Right above the keyboard youll notice you have a nice long speaker grill because after all this is a top firing speaker system As far as the hinge mechanism goes its not particularly great Theres a ton of wobble Its not the most durable hinge mechanism either So if youre not careful in the long term with the way you open your laptop there can be potential implications You do have a similar display fitting compared to previous generations So youve got a plastic encasing all around You have a slightly noticeable chin at the bottom though its not too dramatic At the side you have reasonably thin bezels allowing for an immersive view And then the top forehead isnt too big either At the center you do have a IR equipped full HD webcam system Its not really all that good It performs quite poorly in medium to low light settings though it does well enough in brighter settings Believe it or not Lenovo has been spamming the same display specs roughly for the past four years on the Idea Pad 5 and its getting a little out of hand with the base display So things start off nice enough with a IPS panel a 16in size as well as a full HD plus resolution that gives you a 16x10 aspect ratio But then it quickly goes downhill cuz you still get a base 60 Hz refresh rate And to make matters even worse you have a peak brightness of just 300 nits which is barely enough for a welllit room But anything beyond that you are going to get a ton of glare And the antiglare coating here is kind of overextended So instead of reducing and mitigating glare it kind of just spreads the light even more not helping a lot To make matters worse while you do have a very responsive touch captive system here you have a ton of resistance because of the way theyve applied the antiglare coating making it not ideal to touch with your fingers And the worst crime here is the fact that you still get a 45 NTSC rating with the base display in 2025 They should have been 100 sRGB as standard and why its not there is beyond me Now with that said it is worth noting depending on where you are you may have the option to upgrade this to a higher quality OLED display with a higher refresh rate as well as color spectrum rating So if color sensitivity is important to you definitely consider that option if its available A quick recap of the technical specifications on board So with this model we do have AMDs Ryzen AI7 350 processor We got 16 GB of DDR5 memory and also we do have AMDs Radeon 860M integrated graphics You can also downscale to a lower tier Ryzen AI5 processor instead which gives you the 840M integrated graphics And you can also get the IdeaPad 5i which has various Intel configurations You may remember earlier in the review I said that one of the biggest improvements with the Idea Pad 5 is the internal performance and I wasnt exaggerating So things start off pretty standard with general performance Everythings smooth whether its surfing the web or crunching word documents Advanced productivity like programming code compilation We had absolutely no performance issues or zero hiccups if you will and a great experience overall What really impressed me though was when youre doing 3D modeling and programs like Blender we had such a smooth experience It was almost unrealistic So as long as youve got a light to medium intensity model youre going to find that theres not a lot of frame drops You can actually add quite a bit and you dont run into any major limitations Something that would be absolutely unheard of a generation or two ago with the older Idea Pad 5 models Equally impressive is the fact that you can now do multilayer 4K video editing on Procast and Adventure Resolve Stack up to three 10bit layers without any major frame drops You can actually play a timeline in such a smooth fashion Youre like Does this thing have a discrete GPU It doesnt Its running off an introgated GPU the 860M But thats how far these laptops have come And performance here is spectacular to say the least Render times are also quite fast when youre actually trying to render all these 4K files at the same time Now gaming performance just as impressive Casual gaming is entirely in smooth experience Games like Counter Strike Goto for example can consistently hit close to 60 frames per second at high settings with the native resolution enabled showing you again just how far integrated GPUs have come compared to a generation or two ago And this is one of the best Idea Pad 5s Ive seen in terms of performance to date The IdeaPad 5 is one of the handful laptops that still allows you to get a respectable self upgrade option So you have two Sodium DDR5 slots which can be maxed at 32 GB of memory Furthermore you get two M2 slots as well Not one but two which means you dont have to replace your existing SSD You can just add a second one to double your storage And yes the connectivity module is also M2 based So if it goes bad or you want to upgrade to a more powerful WiFi system in the future you can do that as well Thermals for the most part are quite impressive So we found under a unrealistic peak load this laptop hit a average surface temperature around 39 C which is a full 3 cooler than the previous generation A more realistic sustain load however will yield you numbers of around 37 C which again is quite respectable fan noise is not so impressive So you have a single fan setup but despite that when you start doing medium to high intensity workloads the fans or sorry the fan quickly picks up and can hit noise levels around 50 dB which is quite loud So we get a mediumsiz 60Wh battery And while there are gains in efficiency you can expect a realistic runtime of 9 and 12 hours with a general productivity use case Yes benchmark will yield you higher results but a real world use case is generally a better indicator in my honest opinion Now as far as the speaker quality is concerned it is shallow While we do get a top firing speaker system which means good volume theres not a lot of depth theres not a lot of bass and even the highs arent particularly great Heres a quick sound test for reference Applause Heat Heat Applause Music Applause Music Applause With a 900 price tag this is probably one of the best iterations of the IdeaPad 5 yet Yes its true Its not a perfect laptop but you get a ton of value in the form of great performance hardware and IO ports with this machine The fact that you are getting highend productivity laptop performance at that sub 1000 price point in todays world is impressive and you know respectable in its own rights Furthermore youve got great port selection and the overall build quality of the Idea Pad 5 hasnt gone down something that we have seen

trackpad Doesnt have a whole lot of flex Its very tactile and very responsive Somehow Lenovo has managed to use cheap materials and get good results So its hard to hate on them The keyboard is genuinely a piece of work like weve seen with past models So youve got nice large key caps with easy to read and clear font I also appreciate the fact that you have a respectable backlit system here And yes you do get a 10 key number pad of the 16inch model so you can do your number crunching productivity However my favorite part here is the typing experience You have a ton of key travel a nice amount of tactility and a good amount of softness as well making this laptop really comfortable to type on for extended periods and often rivaling if not exceeding higher tier laptops like the Dell XPS and MacBook Pro for example Right above the keyboard youll notice you have a nice long speaker grill because after all this is a top firing speaker system As far as the hinge mechanism goes its not particularly great Theres a ton of wobble Its not the most durable hinge mechanism either So if youre not careful in the long term with the way you open your laptop there can be potential implications You do have a similar display fitting compared to previous generations So youve got a plastic encasing all around You have a slightly noticeable chin at the bottom though its not too dramatic At the side you have reasonably thin bezels allowing for an immersive view And then the top forehead isnt too big either At the center you do have a IR equipped full HD webcam system Its not really all that good It performs quite poorly in medium to low light settings though it does well enough in brighter settings Believe it or not Lenovo has been spamming the same display specs roughly for the past four years on the Idea Pad 5 and its getting a little out of hand with the base display So things start off nice enough with a IPS panel a 16in size as well as a full HD plus resolution that gives you a 16x10 aspect ratio But then it quickly goes downhill cuz you still get a base 60 Hz refresh rate And to make matters even worse you have a peak brightness of just 300 nits which is barely enough for a welllit room But anything beyond that you are going to get a ton of glare And the antiglare coating here is kind of overextended So instead of reducing and mitigating glare it kind of just spreads the light even more not helping a lot To make matters worse while you do have a very responsive touch captive system here you have a ton of resistance because of the way theyve applied the antiglare coating making it not ideal to touch with your fingers And the worst crime here is the fact that you still get a 45 NTSC rating with the base display in 2025 They should have been 100 sRGB as standard and why its not there is beyond me Now with that said it is worth noting depending on where you are you may have the option to upgrade this to a higher quality OLED display with a higher refresh rate as well as color spectrum rating So if color sensitivity is important to you definitely consider that option if its available A quick recap of the technical specifications on board So with this model we do have AMDs Ryzen AI7 350 processor We got 16 GB of DDR5 memory and also we do have AMDs Radeon 860M integrated graphics You can also downscale to a lower tier Ryzen AI5 processor instead which gives you the 840M integrated graphics And you can also get the IdeaPad 5i which has various Intel configurations You may remember earlier in the review I said that one of the biggest improvements with the Idea Pad 5 is the internal performance and I wasnt exaggerating So things start off pretty standard with general performance Everythings smooth whether its surfing the web or crunching word documents Advanced productivity like programming code compilation We had absolutely no performance issues or zero hiccups if you will and a great experience overall What really impressed me though was when youre doing 3D modeling and programs like Blender we had such a smooth experience It was almost unrealistic So as long as youve got a light to medium intensity model youre going to find that theres not a lot of frame drops You can actually add quite a bit and you dont run into any major limitations Something that would be absolutely unheard of a generation or two ago with the older Idea Pad 5 models Equally impressive is the fact that you can now do multilayer 4K video editing on Procast and Adventure Resolve Stack up to three 10bit layers without any major frame drops You can actually play a timeline in such a smooth fashion Youre like Does this thing have a discrete GPU It doesnt Its running off an introgated GPU the 860M But thats how far these laptops have come And performance here is spectacular to say the least Render times are also quite fast when youre actually trying to render all these 4K files at the same time Now gaming performance just as impressive Casual gaming is entirely in smooth experience Games like Counter Strike Goto for example can consistently hit close to 60 frames per second at high settings with the native resolution enabled showing you again just how far integrated GPUs have come compared to a generation or two ago And this is one of the best Idea Pad 5s Ive seen in terms of performance to date The IdeaPad 5 is one of the handful laptops that still allows you to get a respectable self upgrade option So you have two Sodium DDR5 slots which can be maxed at 32 GB of memory Furthermore you get two M2 slots as well Not one but two which means you dont have to replace your existing SSD You can just add a second one to double your storage And yes the connectivity module is also M2 based So if it goes bad or you want to upgrade to a more powerful WiFi system in the future you can do that as well Thermals for the most part are quite impressive So we found under a unrealistic peak load this laptop hit a average surface temperature around 39 C which is a full 3 cooler than the previous generation A more realistic sustain load however will yield you numbers of around 37 C which again is quite respectable fan noise is not so impressive So you have a single fan setup but despite that when you start doing medium to high intensity workloads the fans or sorry the fan quickly picks up and can hit noise levels around 50 dB which is quite loud So we get a mediumsiz 60Wh battery And while there are gains in efficiency you can expect a realistic runtime of 9 and 12 hours with a general productivity use case Yes benchmark will yield you higher results but a real world use case is generally a better indicator in my honest opinion Now as far as the speaker quality is concerned it is shallow While we do get a top firing speaker system which means good volume theres not a lot of depth theres not a lot of bass and even the highs arent particularly great Heres a quick sound test for reference Applause Heat Heat Applause Music Applause Music Applause With a 900 price tag this is probably one of the best iterations of the IdeaPad 5 yet Yes its true Its not a perfect laptop but you get a ton of value in the form of great performance hardware and IO ports with this machine The fact that you are getting highend productivity laptop performance at that sub 1000 price point in todays world is impressive and you know respectable in its own rights Furthermore youve got great port selection and the overall build quality of the Idea Pad 5 hasnt gone down something that we have seen with some other manufacturers Now the laptop like I mentioned isnt perfect You know the display is quite lackluster and the hinge quality is also quite questionable But despite these flaws from a general productivity perspective this is one of the best sub 1000 laptop configuration you get on the market right now And if theres one thing I can tell you about the Idea Pad 5 it might be a boring looking laptop but it is an equally reliable one and its one that I can wholeheartedly recommend in that capacity There are product links below if you are interested in learning more or purchasing

        "Music all right its been a while since I reviewed a Fastback lit laptop and this year Lenovo did bring some new machines this is aapad 5 it is one of lenovos sleeker 15in laptops but there are also 13 and 17in versions in the idea pad 5 series whats exciting about this one is that it has the ryzen processor with a super fast RAM and SSD drive and youll see in a minute that it is far more capable than just for writing or watching videos on the web and it can be easily used for advanced creative work or gaming but like all laptops in this price category there is always something hidden until it bumps into you so lets take a look at inside the box so here is a charger cables laptop and is that all where are the papers uhhuh here you are I almost thought that I would need to guess how to turn that thing on the build quality of the Lenovo Idea pad 5 is a sophisticated Simplicity I think for a lot of people a good size and weight the exterior surfaces have this cold old metallic clean finish otherwise its got a standard smooth thin lid its not an extraordinary design but if you think silver color is too shiny there are also dark Music versions now when you pop it open the keyboard makes typing a very enjoyable experience and the buttons feel durable the tactile feedback is adequate and there is no visible bending going on around buttons even when you press harder on it for me a good sturdy keyboard is something thats really important because you cant replace it easily the keyboard itself can be bright especially if you have an idea pad with a white backlit keyboard so if you often work at night you will appreciate backl shortcuts but if you want more colors then you will need to check out Lenovo gaming laptops the touchpad itself offers a spaces interface with a smooth surface and good responsiveness its clicking mechanism is wellb built and it quickly detects touch when you press the top and bottom half of the touchpad I like the multitouch just dont expect miracles from it now lets talk a bit about the inputs Lenovo gave the idea pad 5 all essential and New Ports so on the left side of the notebook you can connect the two US USBC one is for charger HDMI along with a headphone jack on the right side we have two usba a and card reader on the top of the screen is a webcam with privacy shutter and it can easily record HD video If you compare it to the phone selfie cams it has average picture quality which is sharp enough for chatting of course you can even use it for creating short clips if you know how to upscale video quality idea pad 5 comes with an almost 16in LED backlit screen with a full HD resolution this screen does a great job of displaying web pages and YouTube videos it will be good for everyday use but if you want even better colors then go with the super IPS screen version with 100 color accuracy which also has a lot better viewing angles even though this IPS screen has average 60 color accuracy colors still look convincing of course its not all perfect like many other laptops in this price class it cant get a lot brighter than 300 nits which is not the best for working outside but its still usable and it still has more than enough brightness for normal use in the office or at home Music as you can see Lenovo outfitted the idea pad 5 with an improved cooling vents designed to keep the laptop quieter and less hot when it is fully loaded the device exhausts its heat towards the bottom of the screen during typing I didnt feel any heat but when you play games the left side below screen can become warmer yet its far from distractable unless you are ice cream if were talking sheer speed the SSD drive booted Windows 11 in an impressive 9 seconds in terms of upgradeability there are no free slots for ram upgrade but you can still replace the M2 Drive Benchmark wise it does quite stack up to the other laptops in this category it has a great CPU and a good amount of ram so completing tasks like programming application or basic editing of photos and videos is an easy thing to do for an affordable mainstream laptop designed for work and play the ryzen 7 processor performed well and without annoying fan noise when it comes to multitasking I tested some apps with YouTube in the background there wasnt lag when scrolling and switching between apps I also tested some games it ran smoothly Apex on High settings and I can say Radeon graphics offers good performance for most popular online games but if you want to play more demanding games like Battlegrounds then it is best to go with the GeForce GTX graphics with a 57 watt battery inside I wasnt expecting to be surprised on the battery test which involves some heavy editing gaming and watching YouTube the battery lasted more than 6 hours but it should last up to 10 hours and more if you lower the screen brightness to 70 and disable some unused background apps the two stereo speakers support Dolby audio and can produce a satisfying range of highs midtones that let you hear all the details and sound effects while only 3 Watts base is subtle it can still surprise in some clips and can perform well for watching shows in general speakers produce a clear sound and its peak max power is comparable with similarly priced laptops unlike a lot of 15 in laptops the Lenovo Idea pad 5 ab7 packs a lightweight chassis with thinnest bezels great keyboard and above average speakers the fhd screen is sharp the only disadvantages are the narrow color coverage so if you want more accurate colors go with 100 color gamut IP screen version as of the build quality despite the plastic around metal the laptop is robustly built and feels it will last the only complaint is there is no RAM memory upgradeability overall Lenovo IdeaPad 5 is still one of the best entry midrange laptops on the market and a great choice for anyone who want a fast and affordable laptop from Music Lenovo",
