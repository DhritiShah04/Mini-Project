        "it is my pleasure to bring you the first look and review of the brand new idea pad 5 pro and whats even better is i have two of them one with an intel 11th gen cpu and one with an amd ryzen 5000 processor if you arent familiar with the ideapad 5 series let me refresh you because its one of the most important laptop series in recent times in 2020 the idea pad 5 laptops particularly with ryzen 4000 cpus were one of the best devices of the year the ideapad 515 and 14 which i have right here really revolutionized the budget laptop category they were the first budget laptops that combined a super powerful cpu with a good enough screen a great keyboard and they were very lightweight to boot all in all they were really the first budget laptops that didnt sacrifice much in fact in my best videos throughout 2020 i awarded the ideapad 515 the best budget laptop you could buy heck to this date my reviews of these laptops are the most viewed on this channel the only major thing wrong with them was that the colors on the displays werent that accurate so you couldnt really use them for photo or video editing plus there were some other little things that i would love to see improved such as a more premium build quality better webcam and less fan noise well today is an exciting day because i have with me the next iteration of these great laptops that promises to deliver a lot more for only around 100 us dollars at least thats what lenovo tells me now keep in mind these are prototypes so things may be different in the final models also these laptops come with a variety of configurations for example my silver model has an intel 11th gen processor paired with a 25 watt nvidia mx450 graphics my dark grey model has a ryzen 5000 series processor with a more powerful nvidia 1650 graphics which lenovo tells me will also be available with the newer more powerful rtx 3050 graphics because of the variations of components and the fact that these are early stage units im not going to go quite as bonkers as i would normally with my performance tests but instead focus more on what its like to use these laptops oh freak in my excitement i forgot to introduce myself if youre new here im josh and i talk tech from the perspective of what its like to own and use these devices if at the end of this video you like what you watched dont forget to smash that subscribe button hit the thumbs up and the notification bell it shows your appreciation for the insane amount of hours that goes into making these and it also makes my mum very happy lets start off with the look and feel of the laptop the ryzen 5000 model is a dark grey and the intel model is a light grey i prefer the color of the intel model with its lid closed its not quite as stunning as a macbook pro 6d but its also not too far off not bad for a midrange laptop with its lid open though it does look a little cheaper than a higher end device like the macbook pro that being said it certainly feels like a high quality build much improved from the plastic feeling ideapad 515 from 2020 there are minimal bezels around the display and the laptop can be opened with one hand one thing that i did like a lot about the ideapad 515 from last year was how lightweight it was at 36 pounds these new models are heavier but then again the chassis is better quality than that device the intel model with the mx450 weighed in at 43 pounds and the amd model with the g4 1650 at 44 pounds this is in line with the macbook pro 16s weight at 43 pounds so its still not too bad the intel variant comes with either an i5 113 ooh cpu or an i71370h which mine has these are the rather confusing new h35 watt intel parts confusing because they are still four core and eight thread 11 gen tiger lake laptop cpus the same as the cpus weve been looking at for the last nine months or so the only difference is they are supposedly designed to work with higher wattage where this falls apart is manufacturers have been feeding the original 11th gen tiger lake laptop cpus with high wattage anyway im looking at you hpn v14 so performance here really isnt that much better as youre about to see it is nice that the intel models do come with an nvidia mx450 graphics as that will provide a nice boost to graphics lets talk about the more interesting amd variants you can get it with either the ryzen 5 5600h or ryzen 75800h which mine has these are super powerful processors with 6 cores and 12 threads and 8 cores and 16 threads respectively i expect these to annihilate the 4 core 8 thread intel variants the amd variant also comes with a gtx 1650 and i believe that in the future you may be able to get it with an rtx 3050 performance of the laptop cant be controlled in lenovos vantage software there is intelligent cooling which is normally a good balance of keeping the laptop quiet and performing well and extreme performance which has the laptop running at its full max performance i ran all my performance tests on extreme performance lets start off with geekbench which tests a variety of performance tasks you can see that the newer h35 intel model does actually perform better than the ultrabook 11th gen cpus that have come before it like in the dell xps 13 or the hp envy 14 the ryzen 5800h model performs much better in multicore but its still not as strong as the hb omen a gaming laptop with the same ryzen processor as you can see the macbook air with apples phenomenal m1 chip still beats out both in this test now lets switch to cinebench which runs the cpu at max here we can see the intel model performing a decent amount better than prior ultrabooks with intels 11th gen cpus but its really the ryzen model that shines in this test its extra 4 cores are being utilized here it performs very well for a midtier device however not as well as the hp omen with the same cpu lets take a look at why this might be the case when we look at power delivery the omen just feeds more power to the cpu so that explains it take a look here that the ideapad 5 pro is delivering a lot more power to the amd variant than the intel one this isnt overly surprising given that the amd model has doubled the threads and cores its actually pretty impressive how little extra power it draws for almost double the performance in multicore lets see how well the laptop can sustain its performance as you can see here when i ran cinebench on repeat for 10 minutes i did not see much of a performance drop which demonstrates an effective cooling solution now when we look at cpu temperatures under full load you can see a good result for the ryzen model and a decent result for the intel model at least it doesnt hit boiling point of 100 degrees celsius like the dell xps that being said the ryzens models better performance comes at the expense of extra fan noise by the way remember how the hp omen performed better with the same ryzen cpu look how much louder the fan noise from that laptop is it sounds like a jet engine and i wouldnt take the trade off for a bit of extra performance versus the idea pad 5 pro the laptop feels very cool to the touch when using it for light tasks like browsing the web you dont have to deal with warm temperatures like on the dell xps 13 for those tasks but then again these are much larger laptops when under max load both these laptops feel pretty cool to the touch particularly the intel model but then again it doesnt perform as well as the ryzen model turning to graphics lets take a look at fire strike the full 25 watt nvidia mx450 in the intel model performs very well giving you a nice performance boost over the integrated graphics in something like the dell xps that being said it cant compete with the 1650 in the ryzen model which is substantially more powerful notice how the ryzen ideapad 5 pro beats out the hp and v14 with a supposed more powerful 1650 ti max q i did note in my review of that laptop that its graphics underperformed ill post a link to that review in the description below check it out as its a good one its a similar story when we look at time spy i cant wait to see how much better this laptop performs with the rtx 3050 its apparently getting so overall performance on this laptop is very good for how cool it feels to the touch and the fan noise the intel model with the h35 cpu and mx 450 graphics is a nice step up from ultrabooks the ryzen model the 8 core cpu and beefier graphics is a very competent performance laptop that will be good enough for some fairly intensive tasks inside the laptop the fan and cooling system seems robust with two large fans i dont see replaceable ram but do see an upgradeable ssd the port situation is ample youve got two usb a ports ill be at the slower 32 gen 1 ports youve also got an hdmi port 14 b and for the models with the integrated graphics or the less powerful geforce mx450 charging will be by a usbc power adapter and both usb c ports do support charging on the models with the more powerful dedicated graphics are the geforce 1650 and above they use lenovos charging port to power the device my model with the g4 1650 came with a 135 watt charger please note that even those laptops can be charged from their single usb c port and i powered my ryzen 5000 model with a tiny 45 watt usbc charger while doing light tasks such as browsing the web and there was no battery drain for the intel models one of the usb c port supports thunderbolt 4 for the ryzen models the fastest youll get is usb c 32 gen 2 youve also got an sd card reader which although handy performed poorly in my tests unfortunately i was getting slow speeds in line with the uhs one card reader the sound from the two down facing speakers at the front of the laptop gets reasonably loud and is clear but it lacks a sound stage and bass the display is a monstrous leap forward on so many dimensions its got a large 16 inch display at 2560x1600 resolution with an aspect ratio of 16x10 and whats super cool is it runs at a fast 120hz refresh rate lets stop for a moment seriously those are some really awesome specs everything looked super sharp at this resolution and with that fast refresh rate any movement like scrolling a web page was very smooth in fact in my excel test which i use to show how much information i can comfortably see on screen without needing to squint at the default 150 window scaling i saw an excellent 41 lines of excel but if i drop the scaling down to 125 percent which i found very viewable i saw a monstrous 52 lines absolutely fantastic if you intend to do productivity work on this laptop compared to its predecessors the idea pad 515 and 14 this display is brighter and the color accuracy has been fixed with an excellent 100 srgb score this monitor is excellent for most use cases although dedicated photo editors should still look elsewhere as the colors arent quite accurate enough for that use case overall two thumbs up for the display oh i believe there will also be a 60hz refresh rate version of the display with similar specs that will be in some units so if you do want that fast 120 hertz refresh rate make sure you buy the right model the keyboard is outstanding there is no odd things in the layout its got a numpad its backlit with two levels and importantly it feels very comfortable a little low travel but honestly as far as laptop keyboards go in 2021 its one of the more comfortable ones the trackpad is a very good one its large tracking is accurate and the click is good enough its not the absolute best trackpad ive used on a windows laptop but you wont have any issues with it one thing that i want to address is that the trackpad is not centered on this chassis this is 100 the correct placement it is shifted to the left because this keyboard has a numpad and therefore the whole thing is shifted to the left the webcam really isnt great here it is in excellent lighting conditions oh and by the way a little birdie told me that in the very near future were going to get much better webcams in laptops by the way if youre wondering what this bar is at the top of this laptop it houses a windows hello ir camera for login there was no fingerprint reader though in my models the laptop comes with a sizable 75 watt hour battery that provides excellent run times i ran both laptops on battery saver mode with brightness down three notches playing netflix movies over wifi for 35 hours the amd model had 48 battery remaining and the intel 56 percent this means you should get at least seven hours on the amd model and around eight on the intel model keep in mind im certain that if you dim the screen further youll be able to eke out around an extra hour these really are very good battery results on a large and powerful laptop particularly the 8 core amd model with the geforce gtx 1650 lastly pricing this was one of the greatest benefits of the ideopad 515 and 14 they were very affordable i remember seeing top spec models with 16 gig of ram for under 800 us dollars i think i saw them priced for around 600 for the entry level models anyway according to my sources these should be around a hundred us dollars more for similar specs however as we know this new pro model can be spec with some pretty powerful components so id imagine it would be priced in the lower to mid range for laptops this brings me to my conclusion if these laptops come in at a thousand us dollars or under especially for the ryzen model the ideapad five pro will be one of the main laptops i recommend most people buy ill basically be asking the following do you need a lot of portability then get the macbook air do you want more productivity get the ideapad 5 pro its larger screen and more powerful components particularly in the ryzen model will really make a difference for office work programming and even light to medium weight video editing heck the 120 hertz refresh rate on the screen and as i said those decent gaming graphics will give you a very good esports gaming experience as well look lenovo really have done a superb job with this laptop im super tough in my reviews and for me to say i will be recommending this laptop for most people for around the thousand us dollar price range is a big win well thats all for today folks if you like this video you know what to do smash that

        "This is the kind of laptop I was looking for Looks like an school office laptop but packs some gaming power Perfect for students who also play esports titles",
        "Josh thank you so much for your research and videos I saw your video last year regarding the Lenovo ideapad 5 15 and went ahead and bought it The best investment Ive made in a budget friendly laptop perfect for working from home I am using the laptop as Im writing and I absolutely LOVE it I cant wait for this new release and buy the updated version 3 Thank you"

        "I am quite disappointed that there is no upgradeable ram in this This is quite bad since they users wont be able to upgrade the ram in a few years when more ram becomes useful It also forces us to buy the overpriced higher specd models with more ram Never the less I will be anxiously waiting for pricing and availability to be released since this currently on my short list of laptops to buy for college",
        "What How is this better than my slim 7i pro I feel scammed Isnt the IdeaPad 5 supposed to be kinda the downgraded version of the Slim 7 line If this is priced cheaper than my Slim 7i Pro Im gonna be very disappointed Its already exhausting enough to do research for the very confusing Lenovo series variation and now theres a chance Ive probably paid more money for the inferior product Please tell me that Im wrong",
        "Likewise Ive just bought the 845 laptop cuz im doing compsci next year with software engineering n AI And Id rather buy something thats durable got good graphics allows me to run complex code and I can take notes on Im gonna do it And its scary as hell Cuz thats so much money About 4 months worth tbh"

        "it is my pleasure to bring you the first look and review of the brand new idea pad 5 pro and whats even better is i have two of them one with an intel 11th gen cpu and one with an amd ryzen 5000 processor if you arent familiar with the ideapad 5 series let me refresh you because its one of the most important laptop series in recent times in 2020 the idea pad 5 laptops particularly with ryzen 4000 cpus were one of the best devices of the year the ideapad 515 and 14 which i have right here really revolutionized the budget laptop category they were the first budget laptops that combined a super powerful cpu with a good enough screen a great keyboard and they were very lightweight to boot all in all they were really the first budget laptops that didnt sacrifice much in fact in my best videos throughout 2020 i awarded the ideapad 515 the best budget laptop you could buy heck to this date my reviews of these laptops are the most viewed on this channel the only major thing wrong with them was that the colors on the displays werent that accurate so you couldnt really use them for photo or video editing plus there were some other little things that i would love to see improved such as a more premium build quality better webcam and less fan noise well today is an exciting day because i have with me the next iteration of these great laptops that promises to deliver a lot more for only around 100 us dollars at least thats what lenovo tells me now keep in mind these are prototypes so things may be different in the final models also these laptops come with a variety of configurations for example my silver model has an intel 11th gen processor paired with a 25 watt nvidia mx450 graphics my dark grey model has a ryzen 5000 series processor with a more powerful nvidia 1650 graphics which lenovo tells me will also be available with the newer more powerful rtx 3050 graphics because of the variations of components and the fact that these are early stage units im not going to go quite as bonkers as i would normally with my performance tests but instead focus more on what its like to use these laptops oh freak in my excitement i forgot to introduce myself if youre new here im josh and i talk tech from the perspective of what its like to own and use these devices if at the end of this video you like what you watched dont forget to smash that subscribe button hit the thumbs up and the notification bell it shows your appreciation for the insane amount of hours that goes into making these and it also makes my mum very happy lets start off with the look and feel of the laptop the ryzen 5000 model is a dark grey and the intel model is a light grey i prefer the color of the intel model with its lid closed its not quite as stunning as a macbook pro 6d but its also not too far off not bad for a midrange laptop with its lid open though it does look a little cheaper than a higher end device like the macbook pro that being said it certainly feels like a high quality build much improved from the plastic feeling ideapad 515 from 2020 there are minimal bezels around the display and the laptop can be opened with one hand one thing that i did like a lot about the ideapad 515 from last year was how lightweight it was at 36 pounds these new models are heavier but then again the chassis is better quality than that device the intel model with the mx450 weighed in at 43 pounds and the amd model with the g4 1650 at 44 pounds this is in line with the macbook pro 16s weight at 43 pounds so its still not too bad the intel variant comes with either an i5 113 ooh cpu or an i71370h which mine has these are the rather confusing new h35 watt intel parts confusing because they are still four core and eight thread 11 gen tiger lake laptop cpus the same as the cpus weve been looking at for the last nine months or so the only difference is they are supposedly designed to work with higher wattage where this falls apart is manufacturers have been feeding the original 11th gen tiger lake laptop cpus with high wattage anyway im looking at you hpn v14 so performance here really isnt that much better as youre about to see it is nice that the intel models do come with an nvidia mx450 graphics as that will provide a nice boost to graphics lets talk about the more interesting amd variants you can get it with either the ryzen 5 5600h or ryzen 75800h which mine has these are super powerful processors with 6 cores and 12 threads and 8 cores and 16 threads respectively i expect these to annihilate the 4 core 8 thread intel variants the amd variant also comes with a gtx 1650 and i believe that in the future you may be able to get it with an rtx 3050 performance of the laptop cant be controlled in lenovos vantage software there is intelligent cooling which is normally a good balance of keeping the laptop quiet and performing well and extreme performance which has the laptop running at its full max performance i ran all my performance tests on extreme performance lets start off with geekbench which tests a variety of performance tasks you can see that the newer h35 intel model does actually perform better than the ultrabook 11th gen cpus that have come before it like in the dell xps 13 or the hp envy 14 the ryzen 5800h model performs much better in multicore but its still not as strong as the hb omen a gaming laptop with the same ryzen processor as you can see the macbook air with apples phenomenal m1 chip still beats out both in this test now lets switch to cinebench which runs the cpu at max here we can see the intel model performing a decent amount better than prior ultrabooks with intels 11th gen cpus but its really the ryzen model that shines in this test its extra 4 cores are being utilized here it performs very well for a midtier device however not as well as the hp omen with the same cpu lets take a look at why this might be the case when we look at power delivery the omen just feeds more power to the cpu so that explains it take a look here that the ideapad 5 pro is delivering a lot more power to the amd variant than the intel one this isnt overly surprising given that the amd model has doubled the threads and cores its actually pretty impressive how little extra power it draws for almost double the performance in multicore lets see how well the laptop can sustain its performance as you can see here when i ran cinebench on repeat for 10 minutes i did not see much of a performance drop which demonstrates an effective cooling solution now when we look at cpu temperatures under full load you can see a good result for the ryzen model and a decent result for the intel model at least it doesnt hit boiling point of 100 degrees celsius like the dell xps that being said the ryzens models better performance comes at the expense of extra fan noise by the way remember how the hp omen performed better with the same ryzen cpu look how much louder the fan noise from that laptop is it sounds like a jet engine and i wouldnt take the trade off for a bit of extra performance versus the idea pad 5 pro the laptop feels very cool to the touch when using it for light tasks like browsing the web you dont have to deal with warm temperatures like on the dell xps 13 for those tasks but then again these are much larger laptops when under max load both these laptops feel pretty cool to the touch particularly the intel model but then again it doesnt perform as well as the ryzen model turning to graphics lets take a look at fire strike the full 25 watt nvidia mx450 in the intel model performs very well giving you a nice performance boost over the integrated graphics in something like the dell xps that being said it cant compete with the 1650 in the ryzen model which is substantially more powerful notice how the ryzen ideapad 5 pro beats out the hp and v14 with a supposed more powerful 1650 ti max q i did note in my review of that laptop that its graphics underperformed ill post a link to that review in the description below check it out as its a good one its a similar story when we look at time spy i cant wait to see how much better this laptop performs with the rtx 3050 its apparently getting so overall performance on this laptop is very good for how cool it feels to the touch and the fan noise the intel model with the h35 cpu and mx 450 graphics is a nice step up from ultrabooks the ryzen model the 8 core cpu and beefier graphics is a very competent performance laptop that will be good enough for some fairly intensive tasks inside the laptop the fan and cooling system seems robust with two large fans i dont see replaceable ram but do see an upgradeable ssd the port situation is ample youve got two usb a ports ill be at the slower 32 gen 1 ports youve also got an hdmi port 14 b and for the models with the integrated graphics or the less powerful geforce mx450 charging will be by a usbc power adapter and both usb c ports do support charging on the models with the more powerful dedicated graphics are the geforce 1650 and above they use lenovos charging port to power the device my model with the g4 1650 came with a 135 watt charger please note that even those laptops can be charged from their single usb c port and i powered my ryzen 5000 model with a tiny 45 watt usbc charger while doing light tasks such as browsing the web and there was no battery drain for the intel models one of the usb c port supports thunderbolt 4 for the ryzen models the fastest youll get is usb c 32 gen 2 youve also got an sd card reader which although handy performed poorly in my tests unfortunately i was getting slow speeds in line with the uhs one card reader the sound from the two down facing speakers at the front of the laptop gets reasonably loud and is clear but it lacks a sound stage and bass the display is a monstrous leap forward on so many dimensions its got a large 16 inch display at 2560x1600 resolution with an aspect ratio of 16x10 and whats super cool is it runs at a fast 120hz refresh rate lets stop for a moment seriously those are some really awesome specs everything looked super sharp at this resolution and with that fast refresh rate any movement like scrolling a web page was very smooth in fact in my excel test which i use to show how much information i can comfortably see on screen without needing to squint at the default 150 window scaling i saw an excellent 41 lines of excel but if i drop the scaling down to 125 percent which i found very viewable i saw a monstrous 52 lines absolutely fantastic if you intend to do productivity work on this laptop compared to its predecessors the idea pad 515 and 14 this display is brighter and the color accuracy has been fixed with an excellent 100 srgb score this monitor is excellent for most use cases although dedicated photo editors should still look elsewhere as the colors arent quite accurate enough for that use case overall two thumbs up for the display oh i believe there will also be a 60hz refresh rate version of the display with similar specs that will be in some units so if you do want that fast 120 hertz refresh rate make sure you buy the right model the keyboard is outstanding there is no odd things in the layout its got a numpad its backlit with two levels and importantly it feels very comfortable a little low travel but honestly as far as laptop keyboards go in 2021 its one of the more comfortable ones the trackpad is a very good one its large tracking is accurate and the click is good enough its not the absolute best trackpad ive used on a windows laptop but you wont have any issues with it one thing that i want to address is that the trackpad is not centered on this chassis this is 100 the correct placement it is shifted to the left because this keyboard has a numpad and therefore the whole thing is shifted to the left the webcam really isnt great here it is in excellent lighting conditions oh and by the way a little birdie told me that in the very near future were going to get much better webcams in laptops by the way if youre wondering what this bar is at the top of this laptop it houses a windows hello ir camera for login there was no fingerprint reader though in my models the laptop comes with a sizable 75 watt hour battery that provides excellent run times i ran both laptops on battery saver mode with brightness down three notches playing netflix movies over wifi for 35 hours the amd model had 48 battery remaining and the intel 56 percent this means you should get at least seven hours on the amd model and around eight on the intel model keep in mind im certain that if you dim the screen further youll be able to eke out around an extra hour these really are very good battery results on a large and powerful laptop particularly the 8 core amd model with the geforce gtx 1650 lastly pricing this was one of the greatest benefits of the ideopad 515 and 14 they were very affordable i remember seeing top spec models with 16 gig of ram for under 800 us dollars i think i saw them priced for around 600 for the entry level models anyway according to my sources these should be around a hundred us dollars more for similar specs however as we know this new pro model can be spec with some pretty powerful components so id imagine it would be priced in the lower to mid range for laptops this brings me to my conclusion if these laptops come in at a thousand us dollars or under especially for the ryzen model the ideapad five pro will be one of the main laptops i recommend most people buy ill basically be asking the following do you need a lot of portability then get the macbook air do you want more productivity get the ideapad 5 pro its larger screen and more powerful components particularly in the ryzen model will really make a difference for office work programming and even light to medium weight video editing heck the 120 hertz refresh rate on the screen and as i said those decent gaming graphics will give you a very good esports gaming experience as well look lenovo really have done a superb job with this laptop im super tough in my reviews and for me to say i will be recommending this laptop for most people for around the thousand us dollar price range is a big win well thats all for today folks if you like this video you know what to do smash that

        "Very nice preview I was one of the people who bought the Ryzen IdeaPad 5 14 model at top specs The only thing that killed me was the abysmal color accuracy and I dont use it for editing photos or anything color sensitive So it ended up going back and Ive been on the hunt for something that fits the bill for me for the past 9 months If they only made one of these without a number pad so that I would actually be centered to the screen I think it would be a slam dunk for me Maybe there will be a 14 IdeaPad 5 Pro",
        "Hi Great review as usual Do either of these powerthrottle when running on battery I noted with the Surface Laptop 4 with AMD that it reduces the performance by half when on the battery to achieve those battery figures I suspect Lenovo does not do this as battery life is average but it would be good to know I have found that the MX450 on my Samsung Flex2 is a battery killer with no switch to just using Xe a pain The nonMX450 version gets 50 more SoT I wonder if that is why the Intel version only gets 78h SoT running a video on loop There seems still no reason to buy the Intel version they are still playing catch up with AMD let alone with the soon to be released M1X Macs Sadly buying AMD has been a lesson in patience and TBH needs to sort out their supplyside problems They have created two great generations of CPUs missing out on millions of sales due to poor planning If you can find an AMD version it looks like a great option",

combined a super powerful cpu with a good enough screen a great keyboard and they were very lightweight to boot all in all they were really the first budget laptops that didnt sacrifice much in fact in my best videos throughout 2020 i awarded the ideapad 515 the best budget laptop you could buy heck to this date my reviews of these laptops are the most viewed on this channel the only major thing wrong with them was that the colors on the displays werent that accurate so you couldnt really use them for photo or video editing plus there were some other little things that i would love to see improved such as a more premium build quality better webcam and less fan noise well today is an exciting day because i have with me the next iteration of these great laptops that promises to deliver a lot more for only around 100 us dollars at least thats what lenovo tells me now keep in mind these are prototypes so things may be different in the final models also these laptops come with a variety of configurations for example my silver model has an intel 11th gen processor paired with a 25 watt nvidia mx450 graphics my dark grey model has a ryzen 5000 series processor with a more powerful nvidia 1650 graphics which lenovo tells me will also be available with the newer more powerful rtx 3050 graphics because of the variations of components and the fact that these are early stage units im not going to go quite as bonkers as i would normally with my performance tests but instead focus more on what its like to use these laptops oh freak in my excitement i forgot to introduce myself if youre new here im josh and i talk tech from the perspective of what its like to own and use these devices if at the end of this video you like what you watched dont forget to smash that subscribe button hit the thumbs up and the notification bell it shows your appreciation for the insane amount of hours that goes into making these and it also makes my mum very happy lets start off with the look and feel of the laptop the ryzen 5000 model is a dark grey and the intel model is a light grey i prefer the color of the intel model with its lid closed its not quite as stunning as a macbook pro 6d but its also not too far off not bad for a midrange laptop with its lid open though it does look a little cheaper than a higher end device like the macbook pro that being said it certainly feels like a high quality build much improved from the plastic feeling ideapad 515 from 2020 there are minimal bezels around the display and the laptop can be opened with one hand one thing that i did like a lot about the ideapad 515 from last year was how lightweight it was at 36 pounds these new models are heavier but then again the chassis is better quality than that device the intel model with the mx450 weighed in at 43 pounds and the amd model with the g4 1650 at 44 pounds this is in line with the macbook pro 16s weight at 43 pounds so its still not too bad the intel variant comes with either an i5 113 ooh cpu or an i71370h which mine has these are the rather confusing new h35 watt intel parts confusing because they are still four core and eight thread 11 gen tiger lake laptop cpus the same as the cpus weve been looking at for the last nine months or so the only difference is they are supposedly designed to work with higher wattage where this falls apart is manufacturers have been feeding the original 11th gen tiger lake laptop cpus with high wattage anyway im looking at you hpn v14 so performance here really isnt that much better as youre about to see it is nice that the intel models do come with an nvidia mx450 graphics as that will provide a nice boost to graphics lets talk about the more interesting amd variants you can get it with either the ryzen 5 5600h or ryzen 75800h which mine has these are super powerful processors with 6 cores and 12 threads and 8 cores and 16 threads respectively i expect these to annihilate the 4 core 8 thread intel variants the amd variant also comes with a gtx 1650 and i believe that in the future you may be able to get it with an rtx 3050 performance of the laptop cant be controlled in lenovos vantage software there is intelligent cooling which is normally a good balance of keeping the laptop quiet and performing well and extreme performance which has the laptop running at its full max performance i ran all my performance tests on extreme performance lets start off with geekbench which tests a variety of performance tasks you can see that the newer h35 intel model does actually perform better than the ultrabook 11th gen cpus that have come before it like in the dell xps 13 or the hp envy 14 the ryzen 5800h model performs much better in multicore but its still not as strong as the hb omen a gaming laptop with the same ryzen processor as you can see the macbook air with apples phenomenal m1 chip still beats out both in this test now lets switch to cinebench which runs the cpu at max here we can see the intel model performing a decent amount better than prior ultrabooks with intels 11th gen cpus but its really the ryzen model that shines in this test its extra 4 cores are being utilized here it performs very well for a midtier device however not as well as the hp omen with the same cpu lets take a look at why this might be the case when we look at power delivery the omen just feeds more power to the cpu so that explains it take a look here that the ideapad 5 pro is delivering a lot more power to the amd variant than the intel one this isnt overly surprising given that the amd model has doubled the threads and cores its actually pretty impressive how little extra power it draws for almost double the performance in multicore lets see how well the laptop can sustain its performance as you can see here when i ran cinebench on repeat for 10 minutes i did not see much of a performance drop which demonstrates an effective cooling solution now when we look at cpu temperatures under full load you can see a good result for the ryzen model and a decent result for the intel model at least it doesnt hit boiling point of 100 degrees celsius like the dell xps that being said the ryzens models better performance comes at the expense of extra fan noise by the way remember how the hp omen performed better with the same ryzen cpu look how much louder the fan noise from that laptop is it sounds like a jet engine and i wouldnt take the trade off for a bit of extra performance versus the idea pad 5 pro the laptop feels very cool to the touch when using it for light tasks like browsing the web you dont have to deal with warm temperatures like on the dell xps 13 for those tasks but then again these are much larger laptops when under max load both these laptops feel pretty cool to the touch particularly the intel model but then again it doesnt perform as well as the ryzen model turning to graphics lets take a look at fire strike the full 25 watt nvidia mx450 in the intel model performs very well giving you a nice performance boost over the integrated graphics in something like the dell xps that being said it cant compete with the 1650 in the ryzen model which is substantially more powerful notice how the ryzen ideapad 5 pro beats out the hp and v14 with a supposed more powerful 1650 ti max q i did note in my review of that laptop that its graphics underperformed ill post a link to that review in the description below check it out as its a good one its a similar story when we look at time spy i cant wait to see how much better this laptop performs with the rtx 3050 its apparently getting so overall performance on this laptop is very good for how cool it feels to the touch and the fan noise the intel model with the h35 cpu and mx 450 graphics is a nice step up from ultrabooks the ryzen model the 8 core cpu and beefier graphics is a very competent performance laptop that will be good enough for some fairly intensive tasks inside the laptop the fan and cooling system seems robust with two large fans i dont see replaceable ram but do see an upgradeable ssd the port situation is ample youve got two usb a ports ill be at the slower 32 gen 1 ports youve also got an hdmi port 14 b and for the models with the integrated graphics or the less powerful geforce mx450 charging will be by a usbc power adapter and both usb c ports do support charging on the models with the more powerful dedicated graphics are the geforce 1650 and above they use lenovos charging port to power the device my model with the g4 1650 came with a 135 watt charger please note that even those laptops can be charged from their single usb c port and i powered my ryzen 5000 model with a tiny 45 watt usbc charger while doing light tasks such as browsing the web and there was no battery drain for the intel models one of the usb c port supports thunderbolt 4 for the ryzen models the fastest youll get is usb c 32 gen 2 youve also got an sd card reader which although handy performed poorly in my tests unfortunately i was getting slow speeds in line with the uhs one card reader the sound from the two down facing speakers at the front of the laptop gets reasonably loud and is clear but it lacks a sound stage and bass the display is a monstrous leap forward on so many dimensions its got a large 16 inch display at 2560x1600 resolution with an aspect ratio of 16x10 and whats super cool is it runs at a fast 120hz refresh rate lets stop for a moment seriously those are some really awesome specs everything looked super sharp at this resolution and with that fast refresh rate any movement like scrolling a web page was very smooth in fact in my excel test which i use to show how much information i can comfortably see on screen without needing to squint at the default 150 window scaling i saw an excellent 41 lines of excel but if i drop the scaling down to 125 percent which i found very viewable i saw a monstrous 52 lines absolutely fantastic if you intend to do productivity work on this laptop compared to its predecessors the idea pad 515 and 14 this display is brighter and the color accuracy has been fixed with an excellent 100 srgb score this monitor is excellent for most use cases although dedicated photo editors should still look elsewhere as the colors arent quite accurate enough for that use case overall two thumbs up for the display oh i believe there will also be a 60hz refresh rate version of the display with similar specs that will be in some units so if you do want that fast 120 hertz refresh rate make sure you buy the right model the keyboard is outstanding there is no odd things in the layout its got a numpad its backlit with two levels and importantly it feels very comfortable a little low travel but honestly as far as laptop keyboards go in 2021 its one of the more comfortable ones the trackpad is a very good one its large tracking is accurate and the click is good enough its not the absolute best trackpad ive used on a windows laptop but you wont have any issues with it one thing that i want to address is that the trackpad is not centered on this chassis this is 100 the correct placement it is shifted to the left because this keyboard has a numpad and therefore the whole thing is shifted to the left the webcam really isnt great here it is in excellent lighting conditions oh and by the way a little birdie told me that in the very near future were going to get much better webcams in laptops by the way if youre wondering what this bar is at the top of this laptop it houses a windows hello ir camera for login there was no fingerprint reader though in my models the laptop comes with a sizable 75 watt hour battery that provides excellent run times i ran both laptops on battery saver mode with brightness down three notches playing netflix movies over wifi for 35 hours the amd model had 48 battery remaining and the intel 56 percent this means you should get at least seven hours on the amd model and around eight on the intel model keep in mind im certain that if you dim the screen further youll be able to eke out around an extra hour these really are very good battery results on a large and powerful laptop particularly the 8 core amd model with the geforce gtx 1650 lastly pricing this was one of the greatest benefits of the ideopad 515 and 14 they were very affordable i remember seeing top spec models with 16 gig of ram for under 800 us dollars i think i saw them priced for around 600 for the entry level models anyway according to my sources these should be around a hundred us dollars more for similar specs however as we know this new pro model can be spec with some pretty powerful components so id imagine it would be priced in the lower to mid range for laptops this brings me to my conclusion if these laptops come in at a thousand us dollars or under especially for the ryzen model the ideapad five pro will be one of the main laptops i recommend most people buy ill basically be asking the following do you need a lot of portability then get the macbook air do you want more productivity get the ideapad 5 pro its larger screen and more powerful components particularly in the ryzen model will really make a difference for office work programming and even light to medium weight video editing heck the 120 hertz refresh rate on the screen and as i said those decent gaming graphics will give you a very good esports gaming experience as well look lenovo really have done a superb job with this laptop im super tough in my reviews and for me to say i will be recommending this laptop for most people for around the thousand us dollar price range is a big win well thats all for today folks if you like this video you know what to do smash that subscribe button hit the thumbs up and the notification bell i would truly appreciate it and so would my mum for behind the scenes coverage and just generally whats going on in my life please follow me on instagram tick tock and twitter links in the description below till next time go do something awesome with your day and i will catch you later",
        "Yup this is the one I legit listed my current gaming laptop on a local marketplace right after I finished the video So hyped for this I hope a decent spec model with the 1650 is around 1200 Thanks Josh",
        "Btw insanely great reviews josh Been following you for quite a while and honestly I dont quite understand how you havent got millions of subscribers yet Keep up the insanely good work i believe its only a matter of time til the YouTube recommendation algorithm do you justice"

        "Likewise Ive just bought the 845 laptop cuz im doing compsci next year with software engineering n AI And Id rather buy something thats durable got good graphics allows me to run complex code and I can take notes on Im gonna do it And its scary as hell Cuz thats so much money About 4 months worth tbh",
        "D R Im not really sure I hear their XPS products are pretty solid If those are the only issues with your tablet that may not be so bad I wonder if it is a software issue",
        "buy it nice or buy it twice i learned that the hard way going though XOTIC PC they are poorly built parts on them break or dont function properly I think I bought 5 different ones and each one had a problem within 12 years So a big mistake would be buying from XOTIC PC if you must at least get the 3 year warranty you will make use of it I assure you first bad net wired connection card w tons of problems with their killer software second GPU died around 2 years old 3rd power issues within 2 years 4th SSD fails around 2 years old i had a 3 year coverage asked about upgrade expected me pay full price for the upgrade said just give me a replacement and got a new secondary SSD from amazon cheaper then their upgrade RMA price 5th a key randomly pops out of the socket after being 6 months old weird lock ups when storing to data drive please warn people from buying from XOTIC PC"
