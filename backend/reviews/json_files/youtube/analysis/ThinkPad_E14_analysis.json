        "Hello everyone Join me at the beach in 4K to discuss the Lenovo ThinkPad E14 to determine if its any good and if you should buy one yourself As Ive said before on this channel the Lenovo ThinkPad is one of my favorite computers possible Why you ask Well because its built well they look cool and theyre very serviceable Theyre fast They are just sort of the Toyota of laptops Theyre reliable They dont have a lot of drama They just they just do Wardrobe change Now the ThinkPad series laptops in the last decade have creeped up in price Basically theyve started kind of hitting anywhere between the000 and 2000 ranges depending on how you want to how you want to deck one out Thing is though is that these E14s can now be found online eBay Amazon the works for as little as 700 sometimes cheaper if youre getting a good sale And that is exceptional value for this machine See the thing is is that it really only has a few Achilles heels Namely the speakers are absolutely horrible Its not the lightest and thinnest thing in the world especially for a 14in computer I mean for example here we have a 15in MacBook Air And the 15inch MacBook Air is not that much wider and deeper I dont know if you can see that on camera Its not that much wider and deeper than than the E14 but it has much much much better battery life It is much much much faster It has a much much much nicer screen with much much much nicer speakers All is to say that the E14 ThinkPad is a little girthy And youd think that that extra weight would translate into more power or battery better battery life but unfortunately it does not The battery life on this computer is a little bit scant getting somewhere between 8 to 10 hours of practical use which you know in todays day and age is like enough to get you by for a full a full workday but ultimately I would have loved to see a little bit something better out of this class of computer But where its poor in battery life and speaker quality it absolutely is rich in IIO Left side of the computer gets two Thunderbolt 4s a USB typeA port a fullsize HDMI and then of course a TRR R S jack And then on the other side youve got Kensington lock because everybody uses Kensington lock Another type A port And then a little talking Ethernet jack What I really like is that Lenovo ditched the whole proprietary connector in favor for a USBC charger because it doesnt run on solar energy But thats really nice because when that battery inevitably dies youll have a wide array of different options at your disposal to charge it with Bottom line is that the computer is a pretty welle equipped little business machine which is exactly what the ThinkPad series was designed for in the first place And I feel like Lenovo is doing a pretty good job keeping with that theme on these particular computers I dont really have a huge wish list of stuff I would like to see improved on it other than maybe the battery life and the speakers but otherwise for 700 bucks you can do a whole lot worse And in fact I would go so far as to say that it might be one of the best 700 computers you can buy So bottom line is do I recommend the Lenovo ThinkPad E14 I do Despite some of its shortcomings it is a pretty nice laptop with a lot of decent features And overall if youre somebody thats looking to do things like productivity work office tasks a lot of Firefox tabs Chrome etc and so forth and you want to do things like podcasting on site because of the Thunderbolt 4 you can plug in switches and microphones and all that good stuff If you want to do even a little bit of of video editing like some compressed 4K light gaming like Minecraft or Roblox then I think that the E14 is one of the best bangs for your buck especially considering the fact that it is very serviceable and they do tend to be made pretty bulletproof So should you buy the Lenovo ThinkPad 14 Yes you should",
        "Bravox84 M3 has better single core performance and WAY better power efficiency Core 7 has somewhat better multi core slightly better igpu And overall the M3 is better",
        "in many of my videos I actually recommend people pick up the AMD models of these ThinkPad laptops typically because they have better CPU offerings theyre just better battery life more power whatever the case is here this year is a little different because AMD is actually a previous generation CPU in this laptop whereas Intel using the current generation CPU in this laptop so I think that the Intel model is actually very compelling this year because youre getting a very very budget friendly ThinkPad here these are meant to be very budget friendly think pads however youre still getting a brand new recent chip in this laptop here youre not getting a previous generation of and thats what the noo does when it comes to you the E Series and L Series to keep the costs down part of it is what they do is they use previous generation CPUs which is fine I mean it keeps the cost down its not like a CPU becomes useless because its a year old however in this specific case they have decided to keep that CPU current generation this laptop so if youre looking for a very budget friendly but still very premium ThinkPad lets have a look at the e14 Intel model for 24 okay lets have a quick look at some of the offerings here well look at the psref document to get an idea so several different CPU options here we do have some high powerered variants H and some low powered variants U typically what youre seeing here is maybe even that the same number of cores or slightly differ in cores however typically youre going to be getting a different configuration for example so 125h you actually get four P cores and eight efficiency cores and two of these LP cores and then on the 125 U you get the same number of efficiency CES but you actually lose two of the performance cores so that potentially could make a big difference for you depending what youre looking for of course the threads are different there too 155h which is a very powerful CPU Im actually using that on the laptop to do the editing of this video and you get up to a 155 U 165 U there are some differences here you can see the U variants come with Intel Graphics the H variants come with Intel arc graphics so if you are going to be using the igpu here you definitely want to go with one of the H ones 125s its decent realistically and the 155h is a very capable Intel art Graphics its again on the laptop Im using right now same thats going to be in an MSI claw for example so this is going to be most capable CPU by far in general just in terms of raw performance six performance cores eight efficiency cores and you get better Intel art Graphics but theyre all going to be very capable overall some different screen options here here in Canada I dont think we have access to this 1400p well have to see but there are two 1200p 45 ntse 45 ntse nothing special realistic Im not a big fan of those screens big jump here 22k up to a little bit more resolution so you get slightly more pixel density that will be pretty nice realistically on a 14in laptop you get better contrast ratio and you also get 100 srgb so pretty big jump up there so depending on the cost added in Id probably recommend going for that 1400p uh 125h we dont even have the 155h here I guess in Canada realistically you can only go up to 155 U its good but the igpu is not going to be that performant uh but if you dont care not going to be a huge difference some different Ram configurations here again its not soldered or anything like that so you can add it yourself 32 GB uh thats pretty expensive so I mean I would recommend 32 on this laptop however you can certainly add it on your own storage 2242 size storage so thats again thats very expensive there realistically uh screen offerings here not a big fan of either of these realistically theyre okay for just like a general typing machine but I would recommend getting the better one if you get access to it realistically that 1400p screen looks pretty nice realistically it should be uh upgrade you would it should be an upgrade you should pursue if you can and then in terms of the CPU its really up to you if youre going to be doing any form of gaming on the laptop uh the 155 VI is is obviously going to be the 155h is obviously going to be a lot more capable okay lets have a look at the laptop here you can see theres some fingerprints on it Ive been using it actually for about an hour getting it set up you can see fingerprints uh but easy to wipe these things down you basically just take I dont know whatever any type of cloth you know give it a wipe down like that right not going to work give it a quick little so I actually know I like black the black of think pads from back in the day uh but nowadays I really wish there was more gray options realistically just specifically for fingerprints right uh its a pretty structurally sound laptop considering its one of the lower options from Lenovo its very sturdy realistically doesnt have any Flex whatsoever right its got a lot of plastic too but despite that this thing is very sturdy right feels good in the hand sharp edges right some think pads have rounded edges some have sharp edges this one is sharp all right very nice lets get the weight not going to be super heavy 1500 gr so so I dont know 32 33 lb somewhere around there not too bad realistically uh yeah intake on the bottom foot to raise it up pretty standard right same as the AMD version uh you can see here on the left side power in Thunderbolt ports you get Thunderbolt four port very nice usba HDMI microphone combo microphone headphone combo Jack speaker out there other side another usba and RJ45 ethernet and CT lot slot so two usba two USBC one of which is Thunderbolt and then you know just typical power out display out in that so thats nice looking pretty good inside as I said Ive turned it on already right typical ThinkPad design here modern style with the kickout for the camera which I prefer some people dont but I do actually prefer function control swapped kind of the traditional style where the function is on the outside you can go into Advantage here uh well disappear but little Advantage there or bios and swap that around no problem looking pretty nice here right fingerprint you get your power on there uh some of these have backl keyboards some do not right all your embedded keys there so lets actually open this up now have a look inside okay getting inside the laptop is usually pretty easy looks like this has washer style screws which I actually do prefer meaning they dont fall out when you take them out just a little bit of torque and you can go like that get that in there give it a Twist see that some to like that then you dont have to pull and you dont overextend it basically always go in the back on these and Ill show you why okay and just going around the front right this one actually doesnt have a hinge style clip so you can go all the way around with a guitar pick some of them have kind of hooks on the bottom so you dont want to you typically want to hinge like that this one doesnt have that so some structure in here for the ram pretty straightforward right metal bottom interestingly it actually is metal I thought it was plastic but it actually is a metal bottom to give it some extra structure so thats nice nice to got a little metal on it and theres a look inside the laptop so for a budget oper ring I mean these look pretty good considering their budget different battery options on this this one here is a one here is a 46 47 wat hour battery probably as big as you could get in this thing physically cuz the motherboard actually is pretty large realistically in this laptop the new upgraded ThinkPad speakers you can see that they are the rectangular Style higher wattage ones which they basically have all the think pads are upgraded this year which I love to see because think pads are premium supposed to be premium even the lowend even the lower cost ones like this here should at least have acceptable sound so I expect this to sound decent not you know be groundbreaking but it should be decent and decent should be a huge upgrade from last year realistically so thats nice there upgrade ability you do have dual nvme really nice 2242 one there 2280 I me fantastic upgradeable WiFi Fant fantastic and upgradeable Ram two kits of uh two sticks of ram there so I mean what more do you want out of a 14in laptop two storage devices two RAM and upgradeable WiFi good speakers as big as batteries you can possibly fit and a huge heat sink right I mean its not a gaming laptop its just got an APU nice thick heat pipe on there there right over the Apu there and one of these larger fans there should not produce too much turbulence or noise so this actually looks really nice inside really stickly okay well do a quick typing test here fire that up there uh function and control as I mentioned are swap there swap it in at Lov Advantage if you dont like that you can get backlit keyboards you can get it without backlit keyboards uh I mean usually like a 10 addon or something like that copilot button unfortunately uh you do get your uh function keys up here and you can also do function swap so that they turn back into you know volume up volume down kind of stuff right really nice uh typical of the modern think pads where its a lower profile key see that there slightly lower profile Keys like the physical keys arent super tall uh but tons of travel just like any ThinkPad right tons of travel lets do a quick typing test Im assuming its going to be very nice Ive reviewed the AMD version of this yeah its really nice very very nice ThinkPad keyboard one of the best keyboards youre going to get to type on I actually prefer kind of now the Lenovo Yoga the highend yogas and the legions but thinkpads are just slightly behind that theyre still fantastic realistically youre gonna its going to be a joy youre going to want to type on this and the nice thing is you can see theyre actually recessed down right so you can see that there theres actually a recess down from the chassis which allows the keys to be slightly higher up so theyre actually raised above slightly meaning more travel very nice trackpad is not big typical ThinkPad trackpad very smooth very precise soft click these are meant for you know business environments typically so not going to have a super sharp click of course you do have your track Point nib here left right scroll so when youre typing you can use this to navigate especially in text right use that and then what happens there is you dont have to remove your hand down here every single time youre typing so really really good for typists overall looking pretty good though okay lets have a look at the screen here so its nothing special on this model here 45 ntsc 60 HZ 120 uh 1 1200p 1200p its nothing special realistically there is actually a much better screen offering on this laptop uh its a 1400p so 22k give you a little bit more resolution which look nice right we can see right off the bat its got a little bit of a pinkish tone to it there um you know little bit orangey pink not a really bold red unfortunately because its only 45 ntsc uh blacks are good though in this room here especially right theres absolutely no bleed or anything like that so the blacks are good its not a bad panel in terms of quality its just that the color space is crushed a bit being a 45 ntsc so you know they do have that Higher One realistically come in here right not really that vibrant in terms of the colors its not bad its not a bad screen not a TN 220 TN or something but its a little muted here realistically uh for daytoday business work youre not going to care realistically its going to be fine even watching shows itll be fine but I would recommend if youre going to be using this for any type of content creation or you know as a really primary device in terms of consuming Med media I would recommend just splurging get that 22k screen uh youre going to get the same brightness but youre going to get 100 srgb and a better contrast ratio slightly better resolution so definitely worth it okay well check the audio here I do expect the audio to be okay it has those upgraded speakers these are typically undertuned you can use FX sound to increase the volume but because these are business laptops Applause Music Music Applause Music yeah its totally fine uh theyre not super loud I think they do that on purpose with these think pads that theyre not super super loud in a business setting easy to tune that download FX sound and youll get more sound but overall the speakers are clear sound good big improvement over last year C scores on performance mode uh were getting 93 71 not staggering by any means but again this is the 155 U not the 155h if you got the same laptop with the H variant you would probably get 13 14 even 15000 so it be much more performant but if you dont need that kind of power I mean 9371 still very good youll be able to even do 4K multiframe video editing no problem on this laptop with that kind of score and then when you throw it in silent mode it does drop down to about half of that 4535 more more than enough for just casual browsing you can see thats around 11th gen i7 so I mean definitely going to be more than enough for daytoday use even some fairly demanding stuff will be totally fine even on silent mode WiFi is okay on it I did this in my office area upstairs where I dont have the best reception so its getting okay reception realistically its pretty standard and then looking at battery life thats going to be one of the more strength of this laptop even with that relatively small battery its not going to have a giant battery like some laptops this lower wattage lower power variant of this Intel Core chip is just going to sip on power so here and were burning around 68 Watts so thats good for probably six or even seven hours of just kind of hanging out again and then did some 108p YouTube at 60fps and not a huge jump few more watts being burned around eight or so so thats still going to be good for about 6 hours so youre looking at about 6 hours of YouTube watching on this laptop and then the Envy me thats it do actually very high very high nvme here uh this is a Samsung I believe its a Samsung 980 Pro OEM variant here they put these in a lot of these laptops so its actually very quick here very good if youre using it for any type of video editing or anything like that as a look at the builtin webcam its nighttime not too much lighting my office but decent enough and its doing an okay job a little bit of a more challenging scene Hing rate is actually really good realistically uh so Id say its a decent webcam especially for such a budget offering its definitely fine depending on which model of CPU you get in this you are going to get different igpus this one here is the 155 U so its not going to have the Intel art Graphics still decently capable youre going to be able to play some different games here some semi demanding games things that arent going to be you know super demanding AAA titles will run just fine anything thats older will run very well this some some sparking zero here if you got the 155h with the Intel cor Graphics though then you get very outstanding performance similar to what you get on something like an MSI claw so I guess the takeaway for this laptop is if youre looking for a very high quality but more budget friendly offering of the ThinkPad lineup this is a really nice laptop I would highly recommend getting the better screen the 22k if you can overall these are pretty nice laptops and theyre definitely a lot more budget friendly I am liking the Intel model this year more than the AMD model just because it does have access to those 155h processor which I would highly recommend if you can but these U variant are still pretty good if you need to focus on battery life in a think pad"

options realistically just specifically for fingerprints right uh its a pretty structurally sound laptop considering its one of the lower options from Lenovo its very sturdy realistically doesnt have any Flex whatsoever right its got a lot of plastic too but despite that this thing is very sturdy right feels good in the hand sharp edges right some think pads have rounded edges some have sharp edges this one is sharp all right very nice lets get the weight not going to be super heavy 1500 gr so so I dont know 32 33 lb somewhere around there not too bad realistically uh yeah intake on the bottom foot to raise it up pretty standard right same as the AMD version uh you can see here on the left side power in Thunderbolt ports you get Thunderbolt four port very nice usba HDMI microphone combo microphone headphone combo Jack speaker out there other side another usba and RJ45 ethernet and CT lot slot so two usba two USBC one of which is Thunderbolt and then you know just typical power out display out in that so thats nice looking pretty good inside as I said Ive turned it on already right typical ThinkPad design here modern style with the kickout for the camera which I prefer some people dont but I do actually prefer function control swapped kind of the traditional style where the function is on the outside you can go into Advantage here uh well disappear but little Advantage there or bios and swap that around no problem looking pretty nice here right fingerprint you get your power on there uh some of these have backl keyboards some do not right all your embedded keys there so lets actually open this up now have a look inside okay getting inside the laptop is usually pretty easy looks like this has washer style screws which I actually do prefer meaning they dont fall out when you take them out just a little bit of torque and you can go like that get that in there give it a Twist see that some to like that then you dont have to pull and you dont overextend it basically always go in the back on these and Ill show you why okay and just going around the front right this one actually doesnt have a hinge style clip so you can go all the way around with a guitar pick some of them have kind of hooks on the bottom so you dont want to you typically want to hinge like that this one doesnt have that so some structure in here for the ram pretty straightforward right metal bottom interestingly it actually is metal I thought it was plastic but it actually is a metal bottom to give it some extra structure so thats nice nice to got a little metal on it and theres a look inside the laptop so for a budget oper ring I mean these look pretty good considering their budget different battery options on this this one here is a one here is a 46 47 wat hour battery probably as big as you could get in this thing physically cuz the motherboard actually is pretty large realistically in this laptop the new upgraded ThinkPad speakers you can see that they are the rectangular Style higher wattage ones which they basically have all the think pads are upgraded this year which I love to see because think pads are premium supposed to be premium even the lowend even the lower cost ones like this here should at least have acceptable sound so I expect this to sound decent not you know be groundbreaking but it should be decent and decent should be a huge upgrade from last year realistically so thats nice there upgrade ability you do have dual nvme really nice 2242 one there 2280 I me fantastic upgradeable WiFi Fant fantastic and upgradeable Ram two kits of uh two sticks of ram there so I mean what more do you want out of a 14in laptop two storage devices two RAM and upgradeable WiFi good speakers as big as batteries you can possibly fit and a huge heat sink right I mean its not a gaming laptop its just got an APU nice thick heat pipe on there there right over the Apu there and one of these larger fans there should not produce too much turbulence or noise so this actually looks really nice inside really stickly okay well do a quick typing test here fire that up there uh function and control as I mentioned are swap there swap it in at Lov Advantage if you dont like that you can get backlit keyboards you can get it without backlit keyboards uh I mean usually like a 10 addon or something like that copilot button unfortunately uh you do get your uh function keys up here and you can also do function swap so that they turn back into you know volume up volume down kind of stuff right really nice uh typical of the modern think pads where its a lower profile key see that there slightly lower profile Keys like the physical keys arent super tall uh but tons of travel just like any ThinkPad right tons of travel lets do a quick typing test Im assuming its going to be very nice Ive reviewed the AMD version of this yeah its really nice very very nice ThinkPad keyboard one of the best keyboards youre going to get to type on I actually prefer kind of now the Lenovo Yoga the highend yogas and the legions but thinkpads are just slightly behind that theyre still fantastic realistically youre gonna its going to be a joy youre going to want to type on this and the nice thing is you can see theyre actually recessed down right so you can see that there theres actually a recess down from the chassis which allows the keys to be slightly higher up so theyre actually raised above slightly meaning more travel very nice trackpad is not big typical ThinkPad trackpad very smooth very precise soft click these are meant for you know business environments typically so not going to have a super sharp click of course you do have your track Point nib here left right scroll so when youre typing you can use this to navigate especially in text right use that and then what happens there is you dont have to remove your hand down here every single time youre typing so really really good for typists overall looking pretty good though okay lets have a look at the screen here so its nothing special on this model here 45 ntsc 60 HZ 120 uh 1 1200p 1200p its nothing special realistically there is actually a much better screen offering on this laptop uh its a 1400p so 22k give you a little bit more resolution which look nice right we can see right off the bat its got a little bit of a pinkish tone to it there um you know little bit orangey pink not a really bold red unfortunately because its only 45 ntsc uh blacks are good though in this room here especially right theres absolutely no bleed or anything like that so the blacks are good its not a bad panel in terms of quality its just that the color space is crushed a bit being a 45 ntsc so you know they do have that Higher One realistically come in here right not really that vibrant in terms of the colors its not bad its not a bad screen not a TN 220 TN or something but its a little muted here realistically uh for daytoday business work youre not going to care realistically its going to be fine even watching shows itll be fine but I would recommend if youre going to be using this for any type of content creation or you know as a really primary device in terms of consuming Med media I would recommend just splurging get that 22k screen uh youre going to get the same brightness but youre going to get 100 srgb and a better contrast ratio slightly better resolution so definitely worth it okay well check the audio here I do expect the audio to be okay it has those upgraded speakers these are typically undertuned you can use FX sound to increase the volume but because these are business laptops Applause Music Music Applause Music yeah its totally fine uh theyre not super loud I think they do that on purpose with these think pads that theyre not super super loud in a business setting easy to tune that download FX sound and youll get more sound but overall the speakers are clear sound good big improvement over last year C scores on performance mode uh were getting 93 71 not staggering by any means but again this is the 155 U not the 155h if you got the same laptop with the H variant you would probably get 13 14 even 15000 so it be much more performant but if you dont need that kind of power I mean 9371 still very good youll be able to even do 4K multiframe video editing no problem on this laptop with that kind of score and then when you throw it in silent mode it does drop down to about half of that 4535 more more than enough for just casual browsing you can see thats around 11th gen i7 so I mean definitely going to be more than enough for daytoday use even some fairly demanding stuff will be totally fine even on silent mode WiFi is okay on it I did this in my office area upstairs where I dont have the best reception so its getting okay reception realistically its pretty standard and then looking at battery life thats going to be one of the more strength of this laptop even with that relatively small battery its not going to have a giant battery like some laptops this lower wattage lower power variant of this Intel Core chip is just going to sip on power so here and were burning around 68 Watts so thats good for probably six or even seven hours of just kind of hanging out again and then did some 108p YouTube at 60fps and not a huge jump few more watts being burned around eight or so so thats still going to be good for about 6 hours so youre looking at about 6 hours of YouTube watching on this laptop and then the Envy me thats it do actually very high very high nvme here uh this is a Samsung I believe its a Samsung 980 Pro OEM variant here they put these in a lot of these laptops so its actually very quick here very good if youre using it for any type of video editing or anything like that as a look at the builtin webcam its nighttime not too much lighting my office but decent enough and its doing an okay job a little bit of a more challenging scene Hing rate is actually really good realistically uh so Id say its a decent webcam especially for such a budget offering its definitely fine depending on which model of CPU you get in this you are going to get different igpus this one here is the 155 U so its not going to have the Intel art Graphics still decently capable youre going to be able to play some different games here some semi demanding games things that arent going to be you know super demanding AAA titles will run just fine anything thats older will run very well this some some sparking zero here if you got the 155h with the Intel cor Graphics though then you get very outstanding performance similar to what you get on something like an MSI claw so I guess the takeaway for this laptop is if youre looking for a very high quality but more budget friendly offering of the ThinkPad lineup this is a really nice laptop I would highly recommend getting the better screen the 22k if you can overall these are pretty nice laptops and theyre definitely a lot more budget friendly I am liking the Intel model this year more than the AMD model just because it does have access to those 155h processor which I would highly recommend if you can but these U variant are still pretty good if you need to focus on battery life in a think pad"
