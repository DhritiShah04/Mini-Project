        "heres another laptop you cant buy this is the Lenovo thinkbook 14 plus you can buy it but you have to import it its not available in Canada or the United States I ordered this from AliExpress off of a reseller brought it in and then fell in love with it and Ive been using it for 2 months basically as a daily driver this is a truly truly outstanding laptop to start the video before I even get into it Lenovo you need to bring this laptop to the West cuz this thing is an absolute killer 14in laptop relatively thin not crazy thin its actually a thick enough that it can actually accommodate quite good Cooling in this here does come with an Intel model this is the AMD model here has a gorgeous screen this is going to be a 3K screen 120 HZ refresh rate 100 dcip And its nice and bright this is a killer screen pretty much as good as you can expect from a nonoled screen all metal chassis gorgeous keyboard great trackpad dual nvme inside lots of RAM on this model here its truly fantastic let me show you why this laptop has been my daily driver for the past 2 months unfortunately you just cant buy it though okay and here is the laptop thinkbook 14 plus lovely laptop Ive been using it as a daily driver for I think about two months now you can see theres like fingerprints on it um yeah so I mean Im going to be very well versed in this product its not like a first look uh some of the footage I filmed was when I first got it uh you know doing comparisons and that but Ive actually legitimately been using this as a Dr driver for two months uh or whatever month and a half its probably been uh ports here are fantastic you get a thats the charging port its also 10 gigabit 10 gigabyte per second so 100000 megabytes second when transfers usba HDMI out thats a USB 4 and its a full function USB 4 you can power screen off of it you can do all that uh 40 GB per second 40 gigabyte per second so youll get transfers on like a nvme en closure of you know 3500 3700 megabytes per second headphone microphone combo Jack right side uh you get a little uh I dont know what you call this thing like a little hidden passageway with a usba in there and you can pop in your uh dongle on there which I do I just took it out for now uh you also get a Micro SD card which Ive used for video editing you get a other usba and an ethernet port and a Kensington lock slot fantastic for a little 14inch nongaming notebook here uh it looks really really nice all metal here well bring it in take a look at the weight I Ill cut to some footage of me comparing to the 16in uh variant of this and uh you know get an idea of that but you can see here its not super super heavy 157 g 1571 g thats about 32 33 lb its not super super super light but this is an allmetal chassis and its very robust its not exactly thick its not the thinnest like you know some impossibly Thin MacBook Air cuz this thing has some serious serious Cooling and uh components inside uh but it is you know its all metal so its going to be a little bit heavier than you might expect from you know a little plastic variant of this you know sometimes these things can be plastic basically but this is a fantastic fantastic itic laptop again Ive been using it as a daily driver I kind of got it to just do a review and then I was pretty much Blown Away by it so thats how these things happen right you start to do a review and then youre like well I guess Im using that for the next month and a half to two months uh m2 slot m2 slot that has a little tiny heat sink on it you see that there spoiler alert theres two m2 slots on this little 14inch laptop 2280 size there 2280 size there 2280 size there but they put in a 2242 its a little like half thing but its got a little adapter you just take it out I had a 2242 in this here I had a 2280 in this before actually I had two I had a 2 terab over here I took this out because it wasnt big enough I put in a 2 terab over there and I had a 4 terab over there uh the fans are pretty clean a little bit of dust in there and Ive done a lot of video editing on this but uh yeah I dont I keep a pretty I keep a pretty clean house around here uh you also get a massive battery 85w hour battery in this laptop isnt that just fantastic uh decent speakers too theyre the kind of higher wattage speakers theyre not the full siiz ones you get in like a yoga 9i which are just like massive Boomers but these sound good youll see when we get to the audio section its pretty good better than you know your generic business laptops by a mile upgradeable WiFi is also nice here too then you get this really robust cooling solution again this is just an 8845 HS right uh reasonably thick heat pipes I dont know if you can see that its hard to come some sometimes see thicker heat pipes than the G14 from Asus this thing runs cooler than an Asus G14 which is like three times the price isnt that funny uh you get dual fans here nice dense fins there and uh theyre run they run theres no annoying sounds and they run relatively quiet even during heavy video editing again Ive done dozen like maybe a dozen or two dozen videos on this laptop uh just an APU there theres no dedicated graphics on this model or anything like that uh but the cooling is very robust for what it is the only negative is the ram is soldered uh but you know 32 GB so whatever um you know taking out the sodum I guess they can get in dual nvme once you get up to 32 GB Im fine right thats going to be good for many years to come to be honest the laptop will probably wear out before that point you know youll be using it for years and years and years and years and years eventually wear out so I mean you get two nvme slots that you get over uh you know having sod in memory but you get 32 GB options so youll be fine right and it doesnt have dedicated graphics its not like youre doing like heavy video game programming where you need you know 96 gbt of RAM on a laptop like this its not really what its for its more for you know daytoday drivers or people like me who are doing video editing okay and heres a look at the inside of the laptop you can see the keyboard here its kind of that Microsoft Surface style where it has like a um little bit of a rubbery texture I guess Id call it uh these this is the thinkbook the yoga the idea pad 5 pros theyre all kind of like the same keyboard but sometimes they come with like a smoother texture like that sometimes they come with a rubber one uh then they have the chassis here really really nice uh all metal chassis here speakers firing you know little speaker vent here whatever uh nice big trackpad too um nice Sleek kind of package inside webcam up here with the slider you know nice clean simple package theyre not supposed to be like you know ridiculous and have all kinds of you know accents on them supposed to be a nice clean professional looking package lets have a quick look at the specs here uh so we get the 8845 HS the best processor thats out right now J uh June I guess its July 1st July 2nd of 2024 uh the new AMD and lenov and uh Intel stuffs going to drop so um you know this in a month or two this might be like the second best chip or the third best chip or whatever but as it stands right now its the best chip on the market fantastic uh then you get here 32 GB of RAM soldered but runs nice and fast 7500 MHz good for the GPU igpu uh weird SSD no idea um whatever it runs fine though real Tech uh WiFi six nice good WiFi whatever and then you get the 78m graphics yes yes I have gamed on this a lot and it games well put it that way um this is a import from China so it doesnt really have too much um you know software that comes with it it has none realistically uh they just clean they just put a fresh Windows install because language and that uh but you do you can get Vantage here and you can do your updates through Vantage I probably dont have any because I use this laptop all the time uh so you come in here and you do your updates it works totally fine right uh so lets have a look at the keyboard here uh I mean spoiler its going to be very similar to some of the other tests its going to be similar to some of the other laptops that Ive used recently with basically the same keyboard and I like them so lets do a quick typing test yeah so I mean its like a 10 out of 10 right so the only keyboard that are really better would be like a legion because theyre slightly higher travel slightly higher larger key caps but this thing has you know reasonably large key caps realistically um you know I dont know if you can see that on the camera uh but theyre relatively large for such a thin laptop and theres tons of travel nice and snappy uh you do get backlighting again its kind of the gray thing its not easy to see thats low right you can see it there right you can see that there its perfect for nighttime right its not going to like not super bright with RGB but its enough to light up the keys track pads fantastic its got this nice little cut metal here to give it a little bit of an accent you can see there if I get some reflectivity off it just its just a simple little thing that makes it look nice and pretty nice click on it just really really nice screen here is really something special and thats one of the reasons I got sucked into this laptop besides you know the build quality the performance massive battery good cooling all that whatever you know its just a killer laptop look at the screen here 1920 but the other way so we get 3000 by 1920 its like just should I have a 32k screen its above an 1800p screen isnt that crazy for a 14inch laptop this thing is very fine resolution interestingly it doesnt really seem to kill the battery this thing has crazy good battery life so you get a very fine resolution uh you also get kill it over here 120 HZ refresh rate so its super fine resolution its 120 HZ refresh rate and its 100 dcip And its bright its a bright screen its 100 dcip this thing is absolutely a killer screen uh but I retired an OLED screen laptop for this a very similar OLED screen laptop for this the shaen the adad 5 Pro which had a fantastic olded screen and it wasnt really much of a compromise because yeah I lost some blacks right uh but I gained not being glossy and its still such a nice screen like you can see here thats 100 dcip red right there you nice Vivid Reds here well go to this little part here killer contrast on the killer colors on that really really really vibrant Reds there just an absolutely gorgeous screen turn off that light there I kill off a little these lights here so its not so much washing it out just an absolutely killer screen and such minimal reflectivity and because its not an OLED you dont have to worry about burn in or anything like that which isnt the biggest issue these days but still you just use the laptop right so there are advantages to IPS everything doesnt have to be an OLED especially when you get such a nice uh IPS screen as this right and well bring that down get the Ive used this at night I cant really show it that well black uniformity is perfect theres no Bloom anywhere I use it at night all the time so for this is this is probably the nicest IPS screen Ive ever used realistically I mean you could make it glossy I guess which would make the colors even more vibrant somehow but I dont think its a good idea on this laptop because this is like something that people would actually probably be using in very bright environments and you get no gloss no glare on this at all like its completely non glare but the colors are so freaking vibrant despite that um so I mean this is the nicest IPS screen Ive ever used certainly its Music loud right around 80 or so 82 um decent decent sound overall yeah so a really good sound like obviously they it doesnt have that really lowend base that you know like a yoga 9i or a g 14 or something would have where its a ton of like really lowend deep base uh but there still is base its just you know not that really really low end and its nice and clear throughout the whole track there its really really theyre just nice speakers overall just okay were going to do some cine bench runs not for scores just for uh just for noise and temperatures but well just get this booted up here Im in performance mode you can see you can do function Q balanced silent high performance and that will change the amount of Watts that go to the CPU basically um so its something you might want to use so this is performance okay so we can see there its dumping a ton of watts into the CPU 65 watts in this thin little chassis looks like we are getting a little bit of heat there is it technically throttling though I dont know I dont think its actually throttling yet yeah its not throttling its just getting really hot uh but the fans are going Max Speed lets check the noise so 50 so like a quiet gaming laptop uh but its not an annoying sound theres no pitchy wine or anything like that so uh you know its not super annoying youll see theyll just take a peek at the scores here like 16000 thats the type of scores youd get on this chip on like a gaming laptop U because it it has a two fan cooling system and it can dump 65 Watts a lot of times these thin notebooks only dump 30 Watts or 35 Peak um its usually when you get into a 16in chassis where you can dump the full wattage little 65 Watts so thats going to give it a lot more performance here than some little thin variant of the same laptop because its able to dump more watts into it but it obviously runs a little bit warmer its really nice when youre doing video editing to just get that overhead you can drop it down to balance mode here well see the core package drop down to 50 or so much quieter temperature is dropping down fan spinning down most of the time you can do work on on this thing and honestly you can do in silent mode but even balance mode and its so much quieter wattage will drop down even more probably around 20 or so sustained yeah you can see that there you can see that uh its not even remotely warm anymore now the 8845 HS does scale like obviously you know 20 watts versus 35 watts versus 60 65 Watts there is a performance difference there but these AMD gpus these G AMD apus do very well on Lower Watts so itll still perform like you can see just a peak here right like this is silent Modes still going to get probably in like youre still going to get in five digits no problem on silent mode um so it really depends what youre trying to do just daytoday stuff honestly just even silent mode okay well just do a quick here we dont need to do a ton here we know what the 8845 HS is capable of and that is a lot uh so were here 60 watts on the system there uh were here in balers gate were at 1200p on medium I just threw on a quality d uh quality FSR you dont even need it in the indoor areas you can see they were at 60 FPS right this these apus are very capable um know this is pulling twice the Watts of what an Rog Al or Legion go can do uh so thats good lets go like this and throw it down to balance thatll give us more uh drop down wats 45 no drop in performance right so you dont need to be in performance mode the scaling on these apus is it kind of does a curve and then it kind of levels off so I usually game on balance because it doesnt make a difference those extra 15 wats dont really do anything uh then you can throw it down a silent here and youll still get relatively good performance well go like that there right 23 Watts were still at 55 right so you can pretty much game in most games with s on silent with the Fans not really going uh you know 30 watts is around where those handhelds run and this has a pretty robust cooling system in comparison so you know the fans barely need to do anything just kind of slightly move some arrow and youre going to be fine if youre playing very demanding 2024 titles you know on higher settings you may need to throw it up into balanced mode for example just to get those extra Watts but you can see here I mean its going to run incredibly well here right like this is an indoor area so its not the most demanding area of the game but this game is super hard to run thats why I do it uh do my tests on these apus in balers gate because it really does slam the CPU and the GPU and uh gives you a good idea of kind of a worst case scenario all right lets just eat her in there bye uh and then if well go to just an outdoor area well just kind of go and get an idea of what it will be like Outdoors well go to the most demanding area in the game I guess um by far and kind of get an idea there okay and heres a look at balers gate itself like the city of balers gate youre going to see its going to drop down a bit here so were going to have to throw up the performance mode probably at least not in silent right and now now youre going to youre going to get those little drop downs there as it loads in but usually it does stabilize this is the most demanding area in the game by far uh just massively more demanding than other areas in the game uh typically in here youre going to want to throw on a little bit more scaling or you can turn it down to low just whatever uh were only on quality right so we can throw it on balanced or probably balanced will be fine to be honest uh just in the city of balers gate its just so hard to run right and now you can see were stable those lows like the average is fine 40 or so and then the lows have come up here so this is the most demanding area in the game so if you can run it here youre going to be singing throughout the vast majority of the game so what do I think of the laptop well lets go over the pros first all day battery life youre going to get 12 to 20 hours on idle youre going to be burning around 4 Watts or so sometimes even 35 Watts on idle which is very good at 100 brightness and youre still going to get around 8 to 12 hours on YouTube at 1080p60 partially due to how efficient the system is partially due to to the fact that it has a gigantic 84w battery youre also going to get incredibly good CPU and GPU performance that 8845 HHS processor is incredibly performant in CPU tasks and the igpu is best in class as of right now youre going to get a killer screen on it 145 in 100 dcip 120 HZ refresh rate absolutely killer screen on this laptop you get ports Galore ports Galore on this laptop no shortage despite the fact that its 14inch its a very robust design and it has a great keyboard and trackpad uh and then if youre talking about what the negatives are well I mean you cant buy it at least not in the west unless youre willing to import it so thats going to be huge negative so my takeaway is Lenovo bring this laptop to the West it will sell its outstanding and we deserve it",
        "Hello do you know if we can connect an Egpu on the 40 USB port is it thunderbolt or can accept 40gbs Im waiting for the 1111 hope some good deals for this incredible laptop",

for the GPU igpu uh weird SSD no idea um whatever it runs fine though real Tech uh WiFi six nice good WiFi whatever and then you get the 78m graphics yes yes I have gamed on this a lot and it games well put it that way um this is a import from China so it doesnt really have too much um you know software that comes with it it has none realistically uh they just clean they just put a fresh Windows install because language and that uh but you do you can get Vantage here and you can do your updates through Vantage I probably dont have any because I use this laptop all the time uh so you come in here and you do your updates it works totally fine right uh so lets have a look at the keyboard here uh I mean spoiler its going to be very similar to some of the other tests its going to be similar to some of the other laptops that Ive used recently with basically the same keyboard and I like them so lets do a quick typing test yeah so I mean its like a 10 out of 10 right so the only keyboard that are really better would be like a legion because theyre slightly higher travel slightly higher larger key caps but this thing has you know reasonably large key caps realistically um you know I dont know if you can see that on the camera uh but theyre relatively large for such a thin laptop and theres tons of travel nice and snappy uh you do get backlighting again its kind of the gray thing its not easy to see thats low right you can see it there right you can see that there its perfect for nighttime right its not going to like not super bright with RGB but its enough to light up the keys track pads fantastic its got this nice little cut metal here to give it a little bit of an accent you can see there if I get some reflectivity off it just its just a simple little thing that makes it look nice and pretty nice click on it just really really nice screen here is really something special and thats one of the reasons I got sucked into this laptop besides you know the build quality the performance massive battery good cooling all that whatever you know its just a killer laptop look at the screen here 1920 but the other way so we get 3000 by 1920 its like just should I have a 32k screen its above an 1800p screen isnt that crazy for a 14inch laptop this thing is very fine resolution interestingly it doesnt really seem to kill the battery this thing has crazy good battery life so you get a very fine resolution uh you also get kill it over here 120 HZ refresh rate so its super fine resolution its 120 HZ refresh rate and its 100 dcip And its bright its a bright screen its 100 dcip this thing is absolutely a killer screen uh but I retired an OLED screen laptop for this a very similar OLED screen laptop for this the shaen the adad 5 Pro which had a fantastic olded screen and it wasnt really much of a compromise because yeah I lost some blacks right uh but I gained not being glossy and its still such a nice screen like you can see here thats 100 dcip red right there you nice Vivid Reds here well go to this little part here killer contrast on the killer colors on that really really really vibrant Reds there just an absolutely gorgeous screen turn off that light there I kill off a little these lights here so its not so much washing it out just an absolutely killer screen and such minimal reflectivity and because its not an OLED you dont have to worry about burn in or anything like that which isnt the biggest issue these days but still you just use the laptop right so there are advantages to IPS everything doesnt have to be an OLED especially when you get such a nice uh IPS screen as this right and well bring that down get the Ive used this at night I cant really show it that well black uniformity is perfect theres no Bloom anywhere I use it at night all the time so for this is this is probably the nicest IPS screen Ive ever used realistically I mean you could make it glossy I guess which would make the colors even more vibrant somehow but I dont think its a good idea on this laptop because this is like something that people would actually probably be using in very bright environments and you get no gloss no glare on this at all like its completely non glare but the colors are so freaking vibrant despite that um so I mean this is the nicest IPS screen Ive ever used certainly its Music loud right around 80 or so 82 um decent decent sound overall yeah so a really good sound like obviously they it doesnt have that really lowend base that you know like a yoga 9i or a g 14 or something would have where its a ton of like really lowend deep base uh but there still is base its just you know not that really really low end and its nice and clear throughout the whole track there its really really theyre just nice speakers overall just okay were going to do some cine bench runs not for scores just for uh just for noise and temperatures but well just get this booted up here Im in performance mode you can see you can do function Q balanced silent high performance and that will change the amount of Watts that go to the CPU basically um so its something you might want to use so this is performance okay so we can see there its dumping a ton of watts into the CPU 65 watts in this thin little chassis looks like we are getting a little bit of heat there is it technically throttling though I dont know I dont think its actually throttling yet yeah its not throttling its just getting really hot uh but the fans are going Max Speed lets check the noise so 50 so like a quiet gaming laptop uh but its not an annoying sound theres no pitchy wine or anything like that so uh you know its not super annoying youll see theyll just take a peek at the scores here like 16000 thats the type of scores youd get on this chip on like a gaming laptop U because it it has a two fan cooling system and it can dump 65 Watts a lot of times these thin notebooks only dump 30 Watts or 35 Peak um its usually when you get into a 16in chassis where you can dump the full wattage little 65 Watts so thats going to give it a lot more performance here than some little thin variant of the same laptop because its able to dump more watts into it but it obviously runs a little bit warmer its really nice when youre doing video editing to just get that overhead you can drop it down to balance mode here well see the core package drop down to 50 or so much quieter temperature is dropping down fan spinning down most of the time you can do work on on this thing and honestly you can do in silent mode but even balance mode and its so much quieter wattage will drop down even more probably around 20 or so sustained yeah you can see that there you can see that uh its not even remotely warm anymore now the 8845 HS does scale like obviously you know 20 watts versus 35 watts versus 60 65 Watts there is a performance difference there but these AMD gpus these G AMD apus do very well on Lower Watts so itll still perform like you can see just a peak here right like this is silent Modes still going to get probably in like youre still going to get in five digits no problem on silent mode um so it really depends what youre trying to do just daytoday stuff honestly just even silent mode okay well just do a quick here we dont need to do a ton here we know what the 8845 HS is capable of and that is a lot uh so were here 60 watts on the system there uh were here in balers gate were at 1200p on medium I just threw on a quality d uh quality FSR you dont even need it in the indoor areas you can see they were at 60 FPS right this these apus are very capable um know this is pulling twice the Watts of what an Rog Al or Legion go can do uh so thats good lets go like this and throw it down to balance thatll give us more uh drop down wats 45 no drop in performance right so you dont need to be in performance mode the scaling on these apus is it kind of does a curve and then it kind of levels off so I usually game on balance because it doesnt make a difference those extra 15 wats dont really do anything uh then you can throw it down a silent here and youll still get relatively good performance well go like that there right 23 Watts were still at 55 right so you can pretty much game in most games with s on silent with the Fans not really going uh you know 30 watts is around where those handhelds run and this has a pretty robust cooling system in comparison so you know the fans barely need to do anything just kind of slightly move some arrow and youre going to be fine if youre playing very demanding 2024 titles you know on higher settings you may need to throw it up into balanced mode for example just to get those extra Watts but you can see here I mean its going to run incredibly well here right like this is an indoor area so its not the most demanding area of the game but this game is super hard to run thats why I do it uh do my tests on these apus in balers gate because it really does slam the CPU and the GPU and uh gives you a good idea of kind of a worst case scenario all right lets just eat her in there bye uh and then if well go to just an outdoor area well just kind of go and get an idea of what it will be like Outdoors well go to the most demanding area in the game I guess um by far and kind of get an idea there okay and heres a look at balers gate itself like the city of balers gate youre going to see its going to drop down a bit here so were going to have to throw up the performance mode probably at least not in silent right and now now youre going to youre going to get those little drop downs there as it loads in but usually it does stabilize this is the most demanding area in the game by far uh just massively more demanding than other areas in the game uh typically in here youre going to want to throw on a little bit more scaling or you can turn it down to low just whatever uh were only on quality right so we can throw it on balanced or probably balanced will be fine to be honest uh just in the city of balers gate its just so hard to run right and now you can see were stable those lows like the average is fine 40 or so and then the lows have come up here so this is the most demanding area in the game so if you can run it here youre going to be singing throughout the vast majority of the game so what do I think of the laptop well lets go over the pros first all day battery life youre going to get 12 to 20 hours on idle youre going to be burning around 4 Watts or so sometimes even 35 Watts on idle which is very good at 100 brightness and youre still going to get around 8 to 12 hours on YouTube at 1080p60 partially due to how efficient the system is partially due to to the fact that it has a gigantic 84w battery youre also going to get incredibly good CPU and GPU performance that 8845 HHS processor is incredibly performant in CPU tasks and the igpu is best in class as of right now youre going to get a killer screen on it 145 in 100 dcip 120 HZ refresh rate absolutely killer screen on this laptop you get ports Galore ports Galore on this laptop no shortage despite the fact that its 14inch its a very robust design and it has a great keyboard and trackpad uh and then if youre talking about what the negatives are well I mean you cant buy it at least not in the west unless youre willing to import it so thats going to be huge negative so my takeaway is Lenovo bring this laptop to the West it will sell its outstanding and we deserve it",

review model in one of no novos many weekly offers for 450 or 565 with no operating system bargain when you consider the features it offers good upgrades the SSD WLAN and RAM modules can be all swapped out and upgraded whereare these days and more laptops have solded on memory good inputs the keyboard and touch pad are both comfortable to use for long hours the keys have 15 mm key travel backlit for those late nights The Click pad has a smooth feel for effortless fingered gliding gestures the bonus is the generous pad Dimensions plenty of ports for the cheap price tag the think book

display panel will be fine but the low brightness level of 300 nits and the poor color space coverage of 45 ntse makes the think book unsuitable for image editing work flimsy ethernet while having an ethernet port is a bonus dont you hate the flap designs that feel clumsy to use plus once you plug in the network cable its a difficult job to pull out again if you were in the market for a budget friendly 14in business laptop what other laptops would you be looking at in no particular order heres some to consider Dell fostro 14 HP Pro book 440 G10 Aus Zenbook 14 MSI Prestige 14 Evo Asus Swift go 14 the Lenovo thinkbook 14 Gen 6 is a reliable and dependable compact laptop the display and performance is good enough for general office or working from home tasks just dont use it for creator to editing jobs or AAA gaming two rare sodm slots to upgrade the memory up to 64 GB ddr5 plus the Dual m2 SSD slots are upgradeable for expandable storage cant complain about the number of ports including a funderbolt 4 USBC port at this wallet friendly price tag a useful SD card reader and RJ45 Port the keyboard and touchpad are a joy to use for long periods battery run time is almost good for a day workload dont forget to upgrade to the 60w battery op the noovo thinkbook 14 Gen 6 sits quietly under the radar from its famous cousin the think pad range theres no wow highlights but it doesnt have many faults its features are well balanced and the icing on the cake is the affordable price tag what you guys think leave your comments and discuss below hope you guys enjoyed the review

        "Great review Just want to mention this model has a potential design oversight with a description and solution below With this solution the machine is silent for almost all regular tasks whereas before the fans would kick on often when installing software for example Description Lenovo seems to have created an ingenious cooling system which pulls air from the underside of the chassis across the memory and storage The ventilation grid is partially covered in the center forcing air across other components rather than relying on a dual fan system In theory this helps keep all components cooler and is a great way to utilize a single fan However the fresh air enters closer to the processor and ram leaving unnecessarily high ambient temperatures on the storage which is located adjacent to the heat pipe leading to the fan The potential design oversight To be effective at cooling the mechanism relies on the condition that air is being moved which produces noise in the process This got me wondering if the storage was causing unnecessary stress on the cooling system This simple test involved monitoring the temperatures both idle and under load during a speed test PCIE slot 1 idled at 37C to 42C with a max load of 79C on the speed test PCIE slot 2 idled at 26C to 31C with a max load of 89C on the speed test This proved the drive was susceptible to ambient temperatures from the heat pipe while in slot 1 and the cooling system was working on the drive under load as well and producing noise in the process Solution When the primary drive is in PCIE slot 2 the machine runs dramatically quieter but did hit an uncomfortably high max as mentioned above However placing a 3mm heat sink on the drive do not do this the lid doesnt close yielded max temperatures below 80C putting it in line with being actively cooled I have since ordered a 1mm heat sink which is rated around 6C to 9C which should keep the drive within comfortable temperatures under load which does not happen frequently anyway In the meantime I am trading a potentially high max temperature on the drive while under load for a much quieter machine pending the heat sink tldr Try placing your primary drive into PCIE slot 2 with a 1mm heat sink and see if the machine runs cooler and quieter overall"

        "heres another laptop you cant buy this is the Lenovo thinkbook 14 plus you can buy it but you have to import it its not available in Canada or the United States I ordered this from AliExpress off of a reseller brought it in and then fell in love with it and Ive been using it for 2 months basically as a daily driver this is a truly truly outstanding laptop to start the video before I even get into it Lenovo you need to bring this laptop to the West cuz this thing is an absolute killer 14in laptop relatively thin not crazy thin its actually a thick enough that it can actually accommodate quite good Cooling in this here does come with an Intel model this is the AMD model here has a gorgeous screen this is going to be a 3K screen 120 HZ refresh rate 100 dcip And its nice and bright this is a killer screen pretty much as good as you can expect from a nonoled screen all metal chassis gorgeous keyboard great trackpad dual nvme inside lots of RAM on this model here its truly fantastic let me show you why this laptop has been my daily driver for the past 2 months unfortunately you just cant buy it though okay and here is the laptop thinkbook 14 plus lovely laptop Ive been using it as a daily driver for I think about two months now you can see theres like fingerprints on it um yeah so I mean Im going to be very well versed in this product its not like a first look uh some of the footage I filmed was when I first got it uh you know doing comparisons and that but Ive actually legitimately been using this as a Dr driver for two months uh or whatever month and a half its probably been uh ports here are fantastic you get a thats the charging port its also 10 gigabit 10 gigabyte per second so 100000 megabytes second when transfers usba HDMI out thats a USB 4 and its a full function USB 4 you can power screen off of it you can do all that uh 40 GB per second 40 gigabyte per second so youll get transfers on like a nvme en closure of you know 3500 3700 megabytes per second headphone microphone combo Jack right side uh you get a little uh I dont know what you call this thing like a little hidden passageway with a usba in there and you can pop in your uh dongle on there which I do I just took it out for now uh you also get a Micro SD card which Ive used for video editing you get a other usba and an ethernet port and a Kensington lock slot fantastic for a little 14inch nongaming notebook here uh it looks really really nice all metal here well bring it in take a look at the weight I Ill cut to some footage of me comparing to the 16in uh variant of this and uh you know get an idea of that but you can see here its not super super heavy 157 g 1571 g thats about 32 33 lb its not super super super light but this is an allmetal chassis and its very robust its not exactly thick its not the thinnest like you know some impossibly Thin MacBook Air cuz this thing has some serious serious Cooling and uh components inside uh but it is you know its all metal so its going to be a little bit heavier than you might expect from you know a little plastic variant of this you know sometimes these things can be plastic basically but this is a fantastic fantastic itic laptop again Ive been using it as a daily driver I kind of got it to just do a review and then I was pretty much Blown Away by it so thats how these things happen right you start to do a review and then youre like well I guess Im using that for the next month and a half to two months uh m2 slot m2 slot that has a little tiny heat sink on it you see that there spoiler alert theres two m2 slots on this little 14inch laptop 2280 size there 2280 size there 2280 size there but they put in a 2242 its a little like half thing but its got a little adapter you just take it out I had a 2242 in this here I had a 2280 in this before actually I had two I had a 2 terab over here I took this out because it wasnt big enough I put in a 2 terab over there and I had a 4 terab over there uh the fans are pretty clean a little bit of dust in there and Ive done a lot of video editing on this but uh yeah I dont I keep a pretty I keep a pretty clean house around here uh you also get a massive battery 85w hour battery in this laptop isnt that just fantastic uh decent speakers too theyre the kind of higher wattage speakers theyre not the full siiz ones you get in like a yoga 9i which are just like massive Boomers but these sound good youll see when we get to the audio section its pretty good better than you know your generic business laptops by a mile upgradeable WiFi is also nice here too then you get this really robust cooling solution again this is just an 8845 HS right uh reasonably thick heat pipes I dont know if you can see that its hard to come some sometimes see thicker heat pipes than the G14 from Asus this thing runs cooler than an Asus G14 which is like three times the price isnt that funny uh you get dual fans here nice dense fins there and uh theyre run they run theres no annoying sounds and they run relatively quiet even during heavy video editing again Ive done dozen like maybe a dozen or two dozen videos on this laptop uh just an APU there theres no dedicated graphics on this model or anything like that uh but the cooling is very robust for what it is the only negative is the ram is soldered uh but you know 32 GB so whatever um you know taking out the sodum I guess they can get in dual nvme once you get up to 32 GB Im fine right thats going to be good for many years to come to be honest the laptop will probably wear out before that point you know youll be using it for years and years and years and years and years eventually wear out so I mean you get two nvme slots that you get over uh you know having sod in memory but you get 32 GB options so youll be fine right and it doesnt have dedicated graphics its not like youre doing like heavy video game programming where you need you know 96 gbt of RAM on a laptop like this its not really what its for its more for you know daytoday drivers or people like me who are doing video editing okay and heres a look at the inside of the laptop you can see the keyboard here its kind of that Microsoft Surface style where it has like a um little bit of a rubbery texture I guess Id call it uh these this is the thinkbook the yoga the idea pad 5 pros theyre all kind of like the same keyboard but sometimes they come with like a smoother texture like that sometimes they come with a rubber one uh then they have the chassis here really really nice uh all metal chassis here speakers firing you know little speaker vent here whatever uh nice big trackpad too um nice Sleek kind of package inside webcam up here with the slider you know nice clean simple package theyre not supposed to be like you know ridiculous and have all kinds of you know accents on them supposed to be a nice clean professional looking package lets have a quick look at the specs here uh so we get the 8845 HS the best processor thats out right now J uh June I guess its July 1st July 2nd of 2024 uh the new AMD and lenov and uh Intel stuffs going to drop so um you know this in a month or two this might be like the second best chip or the third best chip or whatever but as it stands right now its the best chip on the market fantastic uh then you get here 32 GB of RAM soldered but runs nice and fast 7500 MHz good for the GPU igpu uh weird SSD no idea um whatever it runs fine though real Tech uh WiFi six nice good WiFi whatever and then you get the 78m graphics yes yes I have gamed on this a lot and it games well put it that way um this is a import from China so it doesnt really have too much um you know software that comes with it it has none realistically uh they just clean they just put a fresh Windows install because language and that uh but you do you can get Vantage here and you can do your updates through Vantage I probably dont have any because I use this laptop all the time uh so you come in here and you do your updates it works totally fine right uh so lets have a look at the keyboard here uh I mean spoiler its going to be very similar to some of the other tests its going to be similar to some of the other laptops that Ive used recently with basically the same keyboard and I like them so lets do a quick typing test yeah so I mean its like a 10 out of 10 right so the only keyboard that are really better would be like a legion because theyre slightly higher travel slightly higher larger key caps but this thing has you know reasonably large key caps realistically um you know I dont know if you can see that on the camera uh but theyre relatively large for such a thin laptop and theres tons of travel nice and snappy uh you do get backlighting again its kind of the gray thing its not easy to see thats low right you can see it there right you can see that there its perfect for nighttime right its not going to like not super bright with RGB but its enough to light up the keys track pads fantastic its got this nice little cut metal here to give it a little bit of an accent you can see there if I get some reflectivity off it just its just a simple little thing that makes it look nice and pretty nice click on it just really really nice screen here is really something special and thats one of the reasons I got sucked into this laptop besides you know the build quality the performance massive battery good cooling all that whatever you know its just a killer laptop look at the screen here 1920 but the other way so we get 3000 by 1920 its like just should I have a 32k screen its above an 1800p screen isnt that crazy for a 14inch laptop this thing is very fine resolution interestingly it doesnt really seem to kill the battery this thing has crazy good battery life so you get a very fine resolution uh you also get kill it over here 120 HZ refresh rate so its super fine resolution its 120 HZ refresh rate and its 100 dcip And its bright its a bright screen its 100 dcip this thing is absolutely a killer screen uh but I retired an OLED screen laptop for this a very similar OLED screen laptop for this the shaen the adad 5 Pro which had a fantastic olded screen and it wasnt really much of a compromise because yeah I lost some blacks right uh but I gained not being glossy and its still such a nice screen like you can see here thats 100 dcip red right there you nice Vivid Reds here well go to this little part here killer contrast on the killer colors on that really really really vibrant Reds there just an absolutely gorgeous screen turn off that light there I kill off a little these lights here so its not so much washing it out just an absolutely killer screen and such minimal reflectivity and because its not an OLED you dont have to worry about burn in or anything like that which isnt the biggest issue these days but still you just use the laptop right so there are advantages to IPS everything doesnt have to be an OLED especially when you get such a nice uh IPS screen as this right and well bring that down get the Ive used this at night I cant really show it that well black uniformity is perfect theres no Bloom anywhere I use it at night all the time so for this is this is probably the nicest IPS screen Ive ever used realistically I mean you could make it glossy I guess which would make the colors even more vibrant somehow but I dont think its a good idea on this laptop because this is like something that people would actually probably be using in very bright environments and you get no gloss no glare on this at all like its completely non glare but the colors are so freaking vibrant despite that um so I mean this is the nicest IPS screen Ive ever used certainly its Music loud right around 80 or so 82 um decent decent sound overall yeah so a really good sound like obviously they it doesnt have that really lowend base that you know like a yoga 9i or a g 14 or something would have where its a ton of like really lowend deep base uh but there still is base its just you know not that really really low end and its nice and clear throughout the whole track there its really really theyre just nice speakers overall just okay were going to do some cine bench runs not for scores just for uh just for noise and temperatures but well just get this booted up here Im in performance mode you can see you can do function Q balanced silent high performance and that will change the amount of Watts that go to the CPU basically um so its something you might want to use so this is performance okay so we can see there its dumping a ton of watts into the CPU 65 watts in this thin little chassis looks like we are getting a little bit of heat there is it technically throttling though I dont know I dont think its actually throttling yet yeah its not throttling its just getting really hot uh but the fans are going Max Speed lets check the noise so 50 so like a quiet gaming laptop uh but its not an annoying sound theres no pitchy wine or anything like that so uh you know its not super annoying youll see theyll just take a peek at the scores here like 16000 thats the type of scores youd get on this chip on like a gaming laptop U because it it has a two fan cooling system and it can dump 65 Watts a lot of times these thin notebooks only dump 30 Watts or 35 Peak um its usually when you get into a 16in chassis where you can dump the full wattage little 65 Watts so thats going to give it a lot more performance here than some little thin variant of the same laptop because its able to dump more watts into it but it obviously runs a little bit warmer its really nice when youre doing video editing to just get that overhead you can drop it down to balance mode here well see the core package drop down to 50 or so much quieter temperature is dropping down fan spinning down most of the time you can do work on on this thing and honestly you can do in silent mode but even balance mode and its so much quieter wattage will drop down even more probably around 20 or so sustained yeah you can see that there you can see that uh its not even remotely warm anymore now the 8845 HS does scale like obviously you know 20 watts versus 35 watts versus 60 65 Watts there is a performance difference there but these AMD gpus these G AMD apus do very well on Lower Watts so itll still perform like you can see just a peak here right like this is silent Modes still going to get probably in like youre still going to get in five digits no problem on silent mode um so it really depends what youre trying to do just daytoday stuff honestly just even silent mode okay well just do a quick here we dont need to do a ton here we know what the 8845 HS is capable of and that is a lot uh so were here 60 watts on the system there uh were here in balers gate were at 1200p on medium I just threw on a quality d uh quality FSR you dont even need it in the indoor areas you can see they were at 60 FPS right this these apus are very capable um know this is pulling twice the Watts of what an Rog Al or Legion go can do uh so thats good lets go like this and throw it down to balance thatll give us more uh drop down wats 45 no drop in performance right so you dont need to be in performance mode the scaling on these apus is it kind of does a curve and then it kind of levels off so I usually game on balance because it doesnt make a difference those extra 15 wats dont really do anything uh then you can throw it down a silent here and youll still get relatively good performance well go like that there right 23 Watts were still at 55 right so you can pretty much game in most games with s on silent with the Fans not really going uh you know 30 watts is around where those handhelds run and this has a pretty robust cooling system in comparison so you know the fans barely need to do anything just kind of slightly move some arrow and youre going to be fine if youre playing very demanding 2024 titles you know on higher settings you may need to throw it up into balanced mode for example just to get those extra Watts but you can see here I mean its going to run incredibly well here right like this is an indoor area so its not the most demanding area of the game but this game is super hard to run thats why I do it uh do my tests on these apus in balers gate because it really does slam the CPU and the GPU and uh gives you a good idea of kind of a worst case scenario all right lets just eat her in there bye uh and then if well go to just an outdoor area well just kind of go and get an idea of what it will be like Outdoors well go to the most demanding area in the game I guess um by far and kind of get an idea there okay and heres a look at balers gate itself like the city of balers gate youre going to see its going to drop down a bit here so were going to have to throw up the performance mode probably at least not in silent right and now now youre going to youre going to get those little drop downs there as it loads in but usually it does stabilize this is the most demanding area in the game by far uh just massively more demanding than other areas in the game uh typically in here youre going to want to throw on a little bit more scaling or you can turn it down to low just whatever uh were only on quality right so we can throw it on balanced or probably balanced will be fine to be honest uh just in the city of balers gate its just so hard to run right and now you can see were stable those lows like the average is fine 40 or so and then the lows have come up here so this is the most demanding area in the game so if you can run it here youre going to be singing throughout the vast majority of the game so what do I think of the laptop well lets go over the pros first all day battery life youre going to get 12 to 20 hours on idle youre going to be burning around 4 Watts or so sometimes even 35 Watts on idle which is very good at 100 brightness and youre still going to get around 8 to 12 hours on YouTube at 1080p60 partially due to how efficient the system is partially due to to the fact that it has a gigantic 84w battery youre also going to get incredibly good CPU and GPU performance that 8845 HHS processor is incredibly performant in CPU tasks and the igpu is best in class as of right now youre going to get a killer screen on it 145 in 100 dcip 120 HZ refresh rate absolutely killer screen on this laptop you get ports Galore ports Galore on this laptop no shortage despite the fact that its 14inch its a very robust design and it has a great keyboard and trackpad uh and then if youre talking about what the negatives are well I mean you cant buy it at least not in the west unless youre willing to import it so thats going to be huge negative so my takeaway is Lenovo bring this laptop to the West it will sell its outstanding and we deserve it",
        "Great video review as usual You should buy and review the Thinkbook 14 gen7 AMD I guess is available in US and Canada with a Ryzen 7735hs for less than 800 usd and do a review comparison between the non plus and the plus model Amazing work",
        "Good review but what programs do you use for video editing Would be nice to know more about how the computer perform there"

      "negative": [
        "Ive been using the same Thinkbook i51335u as reviewed for a year now For gamers out there it runs Minecraft Sodium client with about 20 chunk render distance with no problems obviously the performance drops a little when unolugged It also gets a little warmer on the left side of the keyboard"

        "heres another laptop you cant buy this is the Lenovo thinkbook 14 plus you can buy it but you have to import it its not available in Canada or the United States I ordered this from AliExpress off of a reseller brought it in and then fell in love with it and Ive been using it for 2 months basically as a daily driver this is a truly truly outstanding laptop to start the video before I even get into it Lenovo you need to bring this laptop to the West cuz this thing is an absolute killer 14in laptop relatively thin not crazy thin its actually a thick enough that it can actually accommodate quite good Cooling in this here does come with an Intel model this is the AMD model here has a gorgeous screen this is going to be a 3K screen 120 HZ refresh rate 100 dcip And its nice and bright this is a killer screen pretty much as good as you can expect from a nonoled screen all metal chassis gorgeous keyboard great trackpad dual nvme inside lots of RAM on this model here its truly fantastic let me show you why this laptop has been my daily driver for the past 2 months unfortunately you just cant buy it though okay and here is the laptop thinkbook 14 plus lovely laptop Ive been using it as a daily driver for I think about two months now you can see theres like fingerprints on it um yeah so I mean Im going to be very well versed in this product its not like a first look uh some of the footage I filmed was when I first got it uh you know doing comparisons and that but Ive actually legitimately been using this as a Dr driver for two months uh or whatever month and a half its probably been uh ports here are fantastic you get a thats the charging port its also 10 gigabit 10 gigabyte per second so 100000 megabytes second when transfers usba HDMI out thats a USB 4 and its a full function USB 4 you can power screen off of it you can do all that uh 40 GB per second 40 gigabyte per second so youll get transfers on like a nvme en closure of you know 3500 3700 megabytes per second headphone microphone combo Jack right side uh you get a little uh I dont know what you call this thing like a little hidden passageway with a usba in there and you can pop in your uh dongle on there which I do I just took it out for now uh you also get a Micro SD card which Ive used for video editing you get a other usba and an ethernet port and a Kensington lock slot fantastic for a little 14inch nongaming notebook here uh it looks really really nice all metal here well bring it in take a look at the weight I Ill cut to some footage of me comparing to the 16in uh variant of this and uh you know get an idea of that but you can see here its not super super heavy 157 g 1571 g thats about 32 33 lb its not super super super light but this is an allmetal chassis and its very robust its not exactly thick its not the thinnest like you know some impossibly Thin MacBook Air cuz this thing has some serious serious Cooling and uh components inside uh but it is you know its all metal so its going to be a little bit heavier than you might expect from you know a little plastic variant of this you know sometimes these things can be plastic basically but this is a fantastic fantastic itic laptop again Ive been using it as a daily driver I kind of got it to just do a review and then I was pretty much Blown Away by it so thats how these things happen right you start to do a review and then youre like well I guess Im using that for the next month and a half to two months uh m2 slot m2 slot that has a little tiny heat sink on it you see that there spoiler alert theres two m2 slots on this little 14inch laptop 2280 size there 2280 size there 2280 size there but they put in a 2242 its a little like half thing but its got a little adapter you just take it out I had a 2242 in this here I had a 2280 in this before actually I had two I had a 2 terab over here I took this out because it wasnt big enough I put in a 2 terab over there and I had a 4 terab over there uh the fans are pretty clean a little bit of dust in there and Ive done a lot of video editing on this but uh yeah I dont I keep a pretty I keep a pretty clean house around here uh you also get a massive battery 85w hour battery in this laptop isnt that just fantastic uh decent speakers too theyre the kind of higher wattage speakers theyre not the full siiz ones you get in like a yoga 9i which are just like massive Boomers but these sound good youll see when we get to the audio section its pretty good better than you know your generic business laptops by a mile upgradeable WiFi is also nice here too then you get this really robust cooling solution again this is just an 8845 HS right uh reasonably thick heat pipes I dont know if you can see that its hard to come some sometimes see thicker heat pipes than the G14 from Asus this thing runs cooler than an Asus G14 which is like three times the price isnt that funny uh you get dual fans here nice dense fins there and uh theyre run they run theres no annoying sounds and they run relatively quiet even during heavy video editing again Ive done dozen like maybe a dozen or two dozen videos on this laptop uh just an APU there theres no dedicated graphics on this model or anything like that uh but the cooling is very robust for what it is the only negative is the ram is soldered uh but you know 32 GB so whatever um you know taking out the sodum I guess they can get in dual nvme once you get up to 32 GB Im fine right thats going to be good for many years to come to be honest the laptop will probably wear out before that point you know youll be using it for years and years and years and years and years eventually wear out so I mean you get two nvme slots that you get over uh you know having sod in memory but you get 32 GB options so youll be fine right and it doesnt have dedicated graphics its not like youre doing like heavy video game programming where you need you know 96 gbt of RAM on a laptop like this its not really what its for its more for you know daytoday drivers or people like me who are doing video editing okay and heres a look at the inside of the laptop you can see the keyboard here its kind of that Microsoft Surface style where it has like a um little bit of a rubbery texture I guess Id call it uh these this is the thinkbook the yoga the idea pad 5 pros theyre all kind of like the same keyboard but sometimes they come with like a smoother texture like that sometimes they come with a rubber one uh then they have the chassis here really really nice uh all metal chassis here speakers firing you know little speaker vent here whatever uh nice big trackpad too um nice Sleek kind of package inside webcam up here with the slider you know nice clean simple package theyre not supposed to be like you know ridiculous and have all kinds of you know accents on them supposed to be a nice clean professional looking package lets have a quick look at the specs here uh so we get the 8845 HS the best processor thats out right now J uh June I guess its July 1st July 2nd of 2024 uh the new AMD and lenov and uh Intel stuffs going to drop so um you know this in a month or two this might be like the second best chip or the third best chip or whatever but as it stands right now its the best chip on the market fantastic uh then you get here 32 GB of RAM soldered but runs nice and fast 7500 MHz good for the GPU igpu uh weird SSD no idea um whatever it runs fine though real Tech uh WiFi six nice good WiFi whatever and then you get the 78m graphics yes yes I have gamed on this a lot and it games well put it that way um this is a import from China so it doesnt really have too much um you know software that comes with it it has none realistically uh they just clean they just put a fresh Windows install because language and that uh but you do you can get Vantage here and you can do your updates through Vantage I probably dont have any because I use this laptop all the time uh so you come in here and you do your updates it works totally fine right uh so lets have a look at the keyboard here uh I mean spoiler its going to be very similar to some of the other tests its going to be similar to some of the other laptops that Ive used recently with basically the same keyboard and I like them so lets do a quick typing test yeah so I mean its like a 10 out of 10 right so the only keyboard that are really better would be like a legion because theyre slightly higher travel slightly higher larger key caps but this thing has you know reasonably large key caps realistically um you know I dont know if you can see that on the camera uh but theyre relatively large for such a thin laptop and theres tons of travel nice and snappy uh you do get backlighting again its kind of the gray thing its not easy to see thats low right you can see it there right you can see that there its perfect for nighttime right its not going to like not super bright with RGB but its enough to light up the keys track pads fantastic its got this nice little cut metal here to give it a little bit of an accent you can see there if I get some reflectivity off it just its just a simple little thing that makes it look nice and pretty nice click on it just really really nice screen here is really something special and thats one of the reasons I got sucked into this laptop besides you know the build quality the performance massive battery good cooling all that whatever you know its just a killer laptop look at the screen here 1920 but the other way so we get 3000 by 1920 its like just should I

you get this really robust cooling solution again this is just an 8845 HS right uh reasonably thick heat pipes I dont know if you can see that its hard to come some sometimes see thicker heat pipes than the G14 from Asus this thing runs cooler than an Asus G14 which is like three times the price isnt that funny uh you get dual fans here nice dense fins there and uh theyre run they run theres no annoying sounds and they run relatively quiet even during heavy video editing again Ive done dozen like maybe a dozen or two dozen videos on this laptop uh just an APU there theres no dedicated graphics on this model or anything like that uh but the cooling is very robust for what it is the only negative is the ram is soldered uh but you know 32 GB so whatever um you know taking out the sodum I guess they can get in dual nvme once you get up to 32 GB Im fine right thats going to be good for many years to come to be honest the laptop will probably wear out before that point you know youll be using it for years and years and years and years and years eventually wear out so I mean you get two nvme slots that you get over uh you know having sod in memory but you get 32 GB options so youll be fine right and it doesnt have dedicated graphics its not like youre doing like heavy video game programming where you need you know 96 gbt of RAM on a laptop like this its not really what its for its more for you know daytoday drivers or people like me who are doing video editing okay and heres a look at the inside of the laptop you can see the keyboard here its kind of that Microsoft Surface style where it has like a um little bit of a rubbery texture I guess Id call it uh these this is the thinkbook the yoga the idea pad 5 pros theyre all kind of like the same keyboard but sometimes they come with like a smoother texture like that sometimes they come with a rubber one uh then they have the chassis here really really nice uh all metal chassis here speakers firing you know little speaker vent here whatever uh nice big trackpad too um nice Sleek kind of package inside webcam up here with the slider you know nice clean simple package theyre not supposed to be like you know ridiculous and have all kinds of you know accents on them supposed to be a nice clean professional looking package lets have a quick look at the specs here uh so we get the 8845 HS the best processor thats out right now J uh June I guess its July 1st July 2nd of 2024 uh the new AMD and lenov and uh Intel stuffs going to drop so um you know this in a month or two this might be like the second best chip or the third best chip or whatever but as it stands right now its the best chip on the market fantastic uh then you get here 32 GB of RAM soldered but runs nice and fast 7500 MHz good for the GPU igpu uh weird SSD no idea um whatever it runs fine though real Tech uh WiFi six nice good WiFi whatever and then you get the 78m graphics yes yes I have gamed on this a lot and it games well put it that way um this is a import from China so it doesnt really have too much um you know software that comes with it it has none realistically uh they just clean they just put a fresh Windows install because language and that uh but you do you can get Vantage here and you can do your updates through Vantage I probably dont have any because I use this laptop all the time uh so you come in here and you do your updates it works totally fine right uh so lets have a look at the keyboard here uh I mean spoiler its going to be very similar to some of the other tests its going to be similar to some of the other laptops that Ive used recently with basically the same keyboard and I like them so lets do a quick typing test yeah so I mean its like a 10 out of 10 right so the only keyboard that are really better would be like a legion because theyre slightly higher travel slightly higher larger key caps but this thing has you know reasonably large key caps realistically um you know I dont know if you can see that on the camera uh but theyre relatively large for such a thin laptop and theres tons of travel nice and snappy uh you do get backlighting again its kind of the gray thing its not easy to see thats low right you can see it there right you can see that there its perfect for nighttime right its not going to like not super bright with RGB but its enough to light up the keys track pads fantastic its got this nice little cut metal here to give it a little bit of an accent you can see there if I get some reflectivity off it just its just a simple little thing that makes it look nice and pretty nice click on it just really really nice screen here is really something special and thats one of the reasons I got sucked into this laptop besides you know the build quality the performance massive battery good cooling all that whatever you know its just a killer laptop look at the screen here 1920 but the other way so we get 3000 by 1920 its like just should I have a 32k screen its above an 1800p screen isnt that crazy for a 14inch laptop this thing is very fine resolution interestingly it doesnt really seem to kill the battery this thing has crazy good battery life so you get a very fine resolution uh you also get kill it over here 120 HZ refresh rate so its super fine resolution its 120 HZ refresh rate and its 100 dcip And its bright its a bright screen its 100 dcip this thing is absolutely a killer screen uh but I retired an OLED screen laptop for this a very similar OLED screen laptop for this the shaen the adad 5 Pro which had a fantastic olded screen and it wasnt really much of a compromise because yeah I lost some blacks right uh but I gained not being glossy and its still such a nice screen like you can see here thats 100 dcip red right there you nice Vivid Reds here well go to this little part here killer contrast on the killer colors on that really really really vibrant Reds there just an absolutely gorgeous screen turn off that light there I kill off a little these lights here so its not so much washing it out just an absolutely killer screen and such minimal reflectivity and because its not an OLED you dont have to worry about burn in or anything like that which isnt the biggest issue these days but still you just use the laptop right so there are advantages to IPS everything doesnt have to be an OLED especially when you get such a nice uh IPS screen as this right and well bring that down get the Ive used this at night I cant really show it that well black uniformity is perfect theres no Bloom anywhere I use it at night all the time so for this is this is probably the nicest IPS screen Ive ever used realistically I mean you could make it glossy I guess which would make the colors even more vibrant somehow but I dont think its a good idea on this laptop because this is like something that people would actually probably be using in very bright environments and you get no gloss no glare on this at all like its completely non glare but the colors are so freaking vibrant despite that um so I mean this is the nicest IPS screen Ive ever used certainly its Music loud right around 80 or so 82 um decent decent sound overall yeah so a really good sound like obviously they it doesnt have that really lowend base that you know like a yoga 9i or a g 14 or something would have where its a ton of like really lowend deep base uh but there still is base its just you know not that really really low end and its nice and clear throughout the whole track there its really really theyre just nice speakers overall just okay were going to do some cine bench runs not for scores just for uh just for noise and temperatures but well just get this booted up here Im in performance mode you can see you can do function Q balanced silent high performance and that will change the amount of Watts that go to the CPU basically um so its something you might want to use so this is performance okay so we can see there its dumping a ton of watts into the CPU 65 watts in this thin little chassis looks like we are getting a little bit of heat there is it technically throttling though I dont know I dont think its actually throttling yet yeah its not throttling its just getting really hot uh but the fans are going Max Speed lets check the noise so 50 so like a quiet gaming laptop uh but its not an annoying sound theres no pitchy wine or anything like that so uh you know its not super annoying youll see theyll just take a peek at the scores here like 16000 thats the type of scores youd get on this chip on like a gaming laptop U because it it has a two fan cooling system and it can dump 65 Watts a lot of times these thin notebooks only dump 30 Watts or 35 Peak um its usually when you get into a 16in chassis where you can dump the full wattage little 65 Watts so thats going to give it a lot more performance here than some little thin variant of the same laptop because its able to dump more watts into it but it obviously runs a little bit warmer its really nice when youre doing video editing to just get that overhead you can drop it down to balance mode here well see the core package drop down to 50 or so much quieter temperature is dropping down fan spinning down most of the time you can do work on on this thing and honestly you can do in silent mode but even balance mode and its so much quieter wattage will drop down even more probably around 20 or so sustained yeah you can see that there you can see that uh its not even remotely warm anymore now the 8845 HS does scale like obviously you know 20 watts versus 35 watts versus 60 65 Watts there is a performance difference there but these AMD gpus these G AMD apus do very well on Lower Watts so itll still perform like you can see just a peak here right like this is silent Modes still going to get probably in like youre still going to get in five digits no problem on silent mode um so it really depends what youre trying to do just daytoday stuff honestly just even silent mode okay well just do a quick here we dont need to do a ton here we know what the 8845 HS is capable of and that is a lot uh so were here 60 watts on the system there uh were here in balers gate were at 1200p on medium I just threw on a quality d uh quality FSR you dont even need it in the indoor areas you can see they were at 60 FPS right this these apus are very capable um know this is pulling twice the Watts of what an Rog Al or Legion go can do uh so thats good lets go like this and throw it down to balance thatll give us more uh drop down wats 45 no drop in performance right so you dont need to be in performance mode the scaling on these apus is it kind of does a curve and then it kind of levels off so I usually game on balance because it doesnt make a difference those extra 15 wats dont really do anything uh then you can throw it down a silent here and youll still get relatively good performance well go like that there right 23 Watts were still at 55 right so you can pretty much game in most games with s on silent with the Fans not really going uh you know 30 watts is around where those handhelds run and this has a pretty robust cooling system in comparison so you know the fans barely need to do anything just kind of slightly move some arrow and youre going to be fine if youre playing very demanding 2024 titles you know on higher settings you may need to throw it up into balanced mode for example just to get those extra Watts but you can see here I mean its going to run incredibly well here right like this is an indoor area so its not the most demanding area of the game but this game is super hard to run thats why I do it uh do my tests on these apus in balers gate because it really does slam the CPU and the GPU and uh gives you a good idea of kind of a worst case scenario all right lets just eat her in there bye uh and then if well go to just an outdoor area well just kind of go and get an idea of what it will be like Outdoors well go to the most demanding area in the game I guess um by far and kind of get an idea there okay and heres a look at balers gate itself like the city of balers gate youre going to see its going to drop down a bit here so were going to have to throw up the performance mode probably at least not in silent right and now now youre going to youre going to get those little drop downs there as it loads in but usually it does stabilize this is the most demanding area in the game by far uh just massively more demanding than other areas in the game uh typically in here youre going to want to throw on a little bit more scaling or you can turn it down to low just whatever uh were only on quality right so we can throw it on balanced or probably balanced will be fine to be honest uh just in the city of balers gate its just so hard to run right and now you can see were stable those lows like the average is fine 40 or so and then the lows have come up here so this is the most demanding area in the game so if you can run it here youre going to be singing throughout the vast majority of the game so what do I think of the laptop well lets go over the pros first all day battery life youre going to get 12 to 20 hours on idle youre going to be burning around 4 Watts or so sometimes even 35 Watts on idle which is very good at 100 brightness and youre still going to get around 8 to 12 hours on YouTube at 1080p60 partially due to how efficient the system is partially due to to the fact that it has a gigantic 84w battery youre also going to get incredibly good CPU and GPU performance that 8845 HHS processor is incredibly performant in CPU tasks and the igpu is best in class as of right now youre going to get a killer screen on it 145 in 100 dcip 120 HZ refresh rate absolutely killer screen on this laptop you get ports Galore ports Galore on this laptop no shortage despite the fact that its 14inch its a very robust design and it has a great keyboard and trackpad uh and then if youre talking about what the negatives are well I mean you cant buy it at least not in the west unless youre willing to import it so thats going to be huge negative so my takeaway is Lenovo bring this laptop to the West it will sell its outstanding and we deserve it",

review model in one of no novos many weekly offers for 450 or 565 with no operating system bargain when you consider the features it offers good upgrades the SSD WLAN and RAM modules can be all swapped out and upgraded whereare these days and more laptops have solded on memory good inputs the keyboard and touch pad are both comfortable to use for long hours the keys have 15 mm key travel backlit for those late nights The Click pad has a smooth feel for effortless fingered gliding gestures the bonus is the generous pad Dimensions plenty of ports for the cheap price tag the think book

display panel will be fine but the low brightness level of 300 nits and the poor color space coverage of 45 ntse makes the think book unsuitable for image editing work flimsy ethernet while having an ethernet port is a bonus dont you hate the flap designs that feel clumsy to use plus once you plug in the network cable its a difficult job to pull out again if you were in the market for a budget friendly 14in business laptop what other laptops would you be looking at in no particular order heres some to consider Dell fostro 14 HP Pro book 440 G10 Aus Zenbook 14 MSI Prestige 14 Evo Asus Swift go 14 the Lenovo thinkbook 14 Gen 6 is a reliable and dependable compact laptop the display and performance is good enough for general office or working from home tasks just dont use it for creator to editing jobs or AAA gaming two rare sodm slots to upgrade the memory up to 64 GB ddr5 plus the Dual m2 SSD slots are upgradeable for expandable storage cant complain about the number of ports including a funderbolt 4 USBC port at this wallet friendly price tag a useful SD card reader and RJ45 Port the keyboard and touchpad are a joy to use for long periods battery run time is almost good for a day workload dont forget to upgrade to the 60w battery op the noovo thinkbook 14 Gen 6 sits quietly under the radar from its famous cousin the think pad range theres no wow highlights but it doesnt have many faults its features are well balanced and the icing on the cake is the affordable price tag what you guys think leave your comments and discuss below hope you guys enjoyed the review
