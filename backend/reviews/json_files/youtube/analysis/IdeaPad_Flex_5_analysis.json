        "here we have the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 now in a world where a carton of eggs is reaching ten dollars you struggle to find a good deal on something and that goes for electronics as well but the idea of flex 5 is a reasonably priced machine coming in roughly at about 629 dollars and it offers a lot of bang for your buck at least on paper so what we want to do is find out if this Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 is any good and if you should buy one yourself and before we get started I would like to ask anybody that if you enjoyed this video please like And subscribe it really does help this channel a lot and helps us continue to deliver transparent and bias free content lets get some specs out of the way really quick this one comes with the AMD 5500u processor it comes with 16 gigabytes of ddr4 RAM and that is not user upgradable and it also comes with a 512 gigabyte nvme solid state drive which is user upgradeable pair that with AMD Radeon graphics and all in all youve got a very high performing computer for under 700 its hard to ask for a whole lot more but lets talk about the LCD screen for a little bit has a 14 inch LCD screen it is full high definition touch it is very colorful it is glossy it has about 300 nits of brightness which means that you can use it like on a college campus in a library inside next to an open window but youre probably going to struggle a little bit with direct sunlight right onto it also because it is so super glossy the viewing angles on it even though it is IPS there thwarted slightly you could certainly gather a crowd around it to watch a YouTube video or maybe even a movie possibly well get into that a little bit more later but that said though theyre the the glare on the screen is just maybe like like just like a little bit too its just its like theres a little bit of clear to be expected but its a really really nice panel we go ahead and rate it a four and a half out of Im sorry a four out of five now by the way everybody we have actually changed our rating system we used to do things out of 10 now were doing them out of five were kind of test running a little bit of a new rating system here anyway moving right along performance on this thing is Stellar we rate it about a four out of five now if we switch over here we went ahead and did some benchmarks opencl gets a 30 20 13 13 020 and then on the single core and multicore you have a 1099 and 5990 respectively and as usual on this channel those that want to know what that information means already know what it means so we will not describe what it means suffice is saying that practically speaking this laptop is exquisitely fast if you are doing like multiple Firefox tabs and chrome windows and email and word and PowerPoint and Excel and all that good stuff this thing will handle that with absolutely no problem at all gaming on this thing is going to be a little bit unusual its not a gaming computer but you could certainly play Minecraft in Roblox and some other games on Lower settings it shouldnt struggle with that at all but as far as like 4K raw video editing um youre probably going to want to stay away from that serviceability on the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 is fantastic you have a separate sister board here for the power button and then the two USB ports thats nice in case one of those goes out you only have to replace this one board you do have an nvme slot right here that is used to replaceable with something bigger if you want about really the only thing that takes a bit of a hit is the ram this one does come with 16 gigabytes but it is not upgradable Lenovo doesnt really give that option on a lot of their computers for some reason but um anyway its its other than that screen battery all that stuff is good to work with but while were on the subject of 4K raw video editing lets go ahead and talk about the input and output on this thing although before I do that were going to go ahead and switch over back to the nice little geometric shapes now input and output on this thing is a five out of five it is absolutely fantastic again especially for the price that youre buying this thing for on here you got two USB super speed ports type a uh one of theyre both one of them one of them is always on meaning that like if you had a cell phone or something that you wanted to charge while this thing is sleeping it can do that with no problem you have a fullsize SD card reader right here thats just the little power button and then on this side you have a trrs headphone jack basically microphones and headphones can plug into there you have a USBC 32 gen 1 Port I think it is it supports both power and data transfer on it as well basically you can charge the laptop on here and then you can also get 10 gigabytes per second data rates which is pretty nice youve got HDMI on here oh and by the way another little quick thing about the USBC Port you cannot put a display on it uh HDMI port for those that want to attach a monitor and then of course where you plug it in because it doesnt run on solar energy but where it lacks in solar charging capabilities it has absolutely phenomenal input and output especially for the price basically if you are a photo a photographer doing something on site um an audio production person basically somebody that has like a switchboard lots of microphones this kind of thing you are really not going to want for a whole lot more this thing will do photoshop with no problem it will do um audio processing with no brow problem you have again all those nice ports for things that you just want to attach to it and modularity and all that good stuff so yeah ports on this thing absolutely outstanding we really really appreciate lenovos efforts in the input and output now lets talk about the keyboard on this computer keyboard is a little bit of a mixed bag it is backlight which I really like the keys are very responsive and very tactile however this the keys on it are unusually wide now if you just look at them they look like normal laptop keys but if you were to actually take like a like some calipers and measure them out they are slightly wider than most other keyboard keys are and as a result you will find yourself accidentally hitting the question mark button which is also wider than the comma and the period button by like just a hair and youll also find yourself accidentally hitting the enter button as well it is not a deal breaker but if youre somebody that is like a super fast typist and youre used to other keyboards you will maybe find the transition to this keyboard to be a little bit awkward that said again it is backlit it does not have a fullsize numpad and it does just feel kind of good and firm to type on so were going to rate the keyboard three out of five its not its not great and its something that you could probably get used to but its its just something worth noting that Lenovo just did some weird stuff with the spacing on the keys and made it kind of weird unless unless youre like shin Lim and you just have like little magic fingers youre just gonna have to kind of get used to it its just weird trackpad on this thing though does get a four out of five it is actually pretty like graciously big and multigesture uh recognizes left and right clicks very well doesnt ghost too bad maybe just slightly and for that matter the trackpad also is like a slightly like little firmer than I wish Lenovo track pads tend to actually have a little bit of a lighter mechanical click than the Dell keyboards this or Dell track pads this one kind of feels more like a Dell track pad but that said it is a good track pad and those using it will have no problems whatsoever and then the last coverage on the sort of usability on this machine uh the touch the touch screen does have some active pen support in there too so those that want to use this thing as a notebook or a note taking machine will have no problem basically this thing just flips it just it can it converts like this and then it turns into like a little tablet that you could take some notes on if you were a student all right so I wanted to talk about the pen support really quick it is worth mentioning that this computer is one of the few computers and for that matter one of the few lenovos that actually comes with a pen comes with a little holster that you can clip to the computer and then it comes with an active Lenovo pen as well that is kind of a nice touch on lenovos part but basically you can convert this thing into a tablet here then obviously you can write on it so just put hello it is very responsive I mean again latency is really not bad but I just dont think reasonably speaking youre going to have anybody wanting to take notes with it the pen tip on it is just its a little too rubberized to make writing all that good so I mean you know your doing awesome I mean I dont know theyre just it just doesnt look all that good its a little clunky um you could obviously draw with this thing but you know ultimately I think people will be using this as maybe like an artistic pen and or tablet but probably not really much for notetaking that said Ive always kind of found that to be slightly gimmicky on some laptops and while it does have pen support and it is also accurate with like lower latency the best notetaking experience is probably going to be done on something like an iPad or a remarkable thats going to be like the most true to like pen and paper that you can get now lets talk about these speakers on this computer they are advertised to be Dolby audio and they are an absolute disaster we rate the speakers on here a one out of five they are tinny they have no character they dont get particularly loud and as I said earlier you can use the screen to like gather around with friends and watch a movie except that the speakers on this thing are so damn awful that nobody around the laptop would be able to hear it I theyre not the worst speakers Ive heard in a laptop but they are almost the worst speakers that I have heard in a laptop Lenovo should be ashamed of themselves now that said you do have the audio jack on the side of it so of course you can pop in a set of external speakers or headphones and it wont be an issue whatsoever but thats said its almost like they went out of their way to put the junkiest part spin speakers in there and then slaps a Dolby badge on there why do manufacturers insist on Advertising good speakers on them when they just they just put crap in there so anyway one out of five now lets talk about the features of this computer which are shockingly fantastic we give it a five out of five it has Wireless ax or 6 in it it has Bluetooth it has a very respectable webcam in it in fact heres what that footage looks like now this is a test of the webcam on the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 this is actually one of the better webcams we have tested in a while so color us impressed it has a little privacy shutter on the webcam as well so if youre one that wants to like walk around naked in front of their laptop but they dont want an only fans page then well then here you go youve got some privacy built in it also has a fingerprint reader it does not have a Windows hello compatible camera but it does have USBC charging it also has rapid charging basically meaning it can charge up pretty fast and then of course as I mentioned earlier it does have the 360 degree turned into a notebook tablet feature in there too so for the price at 630 bucks I mean I just really dont know what more youd want in there there are much more expensive laptops with less so thats why we always try to take into consideration the price bracket that the computer is sitting in when we give it a rating so yeah again for the price it absolutely earned its five out of five and for our final category the mobility category it gets a four and a four out of five I keep wanting to say four and a half out of five a four out of five should we do halves well maybe reach out in the comments section and find that out anyway Mobility on this thing its kind of heavy boy its a big boy its about 33 pounds so its not light but the materials are all incredibly well put together it just feels firm and like it can take a beating the Plastics are really really great quality the hinges are nice and smooth by all accounts I think that this thing could go from like laptop to desk or not from desk to backpack to airplane tray table to classroom back to your desk and like all all while getting rattled around with keys and tablets and charging cords and things and this thing would hold up really really well were very impressed with the quality of the materials that Lenovo decided to use with this thing again just some really really great Plastics and you know again there are more expensive laptops that are like cheaper built so they did a great job there battery life on it is going to be between about eight and a half to nine hours practically speaking and again for those that are traveling or running through airports or going to classrooms that is effectively allday battery life and you might get a little bit more if youre like only doing like word and and stuff like that but youll get a little bit less if youre doing something like internet browsing so yeah battery life on it is great materials on it are great its a little bit Hefty so I mean and in terms of like thickness and stuff I mean its kind of thick but like its not like its it had a couple it had too few many Christmas cookies but its still lightweight and compact enough where you can just Chuck it into a briefcase and maybe your Mystery Ranch briefcase or Tokyo bellroy and then youll be right as rain so again all in all earns its four and a half out of five now who is this last top four we really feel that this laptop is for like business people that like to travel a lot uh it is also for people that just need a solid productivity Powerhouse and they dont really mind the slightly smaller screen after all 14 inch screens are my favorite form factor but that said if you dont need the 15 or the 16 inch screens and you just need something kind of nice and Compact and lightweight to sit on your desk and just do its thing this is absolutely perfect for it frankly even nonprofits could do pretty well with this laptop and again at 630 bucks you really get like I mean you get a lot of bang for your buck and because of the serviceability on it where you could replace something like the screen or the nvme drive or something like that if it breaks I mean thats going to this is going to be like a laptop that you can have around for five to six years easily lenovos warranty and customer service is really not too bad its maybe not quite as good as Dells but it is definitely better than Hewlett Packards and probably even like Acer and Asus although a series is pretty solid but nevertheless lenovos customer support is is pretty you know pretty standard across the board so thats good too I think that if youre a photographer and you like to take photos and then load those pictures onto your laptop and kind of edit on site or or just kind of have the laps out there sort of like a backup hard drive this things going to be perfect for that I think this is going to be perfect for audio editors dont really think its going to be that great for video editors you could maybe do some 1080p compressed stuff but yeah I might struggle a little bit not really for gamers either although it can do some light gaming but all in this is just a computer for like students and like business people this is like this is like the new everyday working mans ThinkPad anyway we were very very impressed with this Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 it gets a total score of 375 out of five now that may seem like a bad score but thats like thats like a B minus I mean thats like a very respectable score if they just maybe put in slightly better speakers or maybe just kind of made their keyboards slightly less weird than um I dont know itd be almost perfect one oh actually there is one little fun thing that I noticed on the Lenovo keyboard it says caps LK even though you have this honking big button they got cheap and didnt want to put like the O and the C for caps lock now I checked all the other Lenovo products that we have in the office and sure enough they all say caps LK whereas all of the hps and Dells and acers here all say caps lock thats just kind of a weird lenovoism apparently I never noticed it before in the like as long as Ive been reviewing these things but anyway its just kind of a fun thing to point out anyway I hope that this video was helpful let us know what you think about the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 reach out to us in the comments section if you have any questions or comments please like And subscribe please tell your friends about this Channel and we will be back

fact heres what that footage looks like now this is a test of the webcam on the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 this is actually one of the better webcams we have tested in a while so color us impressed it has a little privacy shutter on the webcam as well so if youre one that wants to like walk around naked in front of their laptop but they dont want an only fans page then well then here you go youve got some privacy built in it also has a fingerprint reader it does not have a Windows hello compatible camera but it does have USBC charging it also has rapid charging basically meaning it can charge up pretty fast and then of course as I mentioned earlier it does have the 360 degree turned into a notebook tablet feature in there too so for the price at 630 bucks I mean I just really dont know what more youd want in there there are much more expensive laptops with less so thats why we always try to take into consideration the price bracket that the computer is sitting in when we give it a rating so yeah again for the price it absolutely earned its five out of five and for our final category the mobility category it gets a four and a four out of five I keep wanting to say four and a half out of five a four out of five should we do halves well maybe reach out in the comments section and find that out anyway Mobility on this thing its kind of heavy boy its a big boy its about 33 pounds so its not light but the materials are all incredibly well put together it just feels firm and like it can take a beating the Plastics are really really great quality the hinges are nice and smooth by all accounts I think that this thing could go from like laptop to desk or not from desk to backpack to airplane tray table to classroom back to your desk and like all all while getting rattled around with keys and tablets and charging cords and things and this thing would hold up really really well were very impressed with the quality of the materials that Lenovo decided to use with this thing again just some really really great Plastics and you know again there are more expensive laptops that are like cheaper built so they did a great job there battery life on it is going to be between about eight and a half to nine hours practically speaking and again for those that are traveling or running through airports or going to classrooms that is effectively allday battery life and you might get a little bit more if youre like only doing like word and and stuff like that but youll get a little bit less if youre doing something like internet browsing so yeah battery life on it is great materials on it are great its a little bit Hefty so I mean and in terms of like thickness and stuff I mean its kind of thick but like its not like its it had a couple it had too few many Christmas cookies but its still lightweight and compact enough where you can just Chuck it into a briefcase and maybe your Mystery Ranch briefcase or Tokyo bellroy and then youll be right as rain so again all in all earns its four and a half out of five now who is this last top four we really feel that this laptop is for like business people that like to travel a lot uh it is also for people that just need a solid productivity Powerhouse and they dont really mind the slightly smaller screen after all 14 inch screens are my favorite form factor but that said if you dont need the 15 or the 16 inch screens and you just need something kind of nice and Compact and lightweight to sit on your desk and just do its thing this is absolutely perfect for it frankly even nonprofits could do pretty well with this laptop and again at 630 bucks you really get like I mean you get a lot of bang for your buck and because of the serviceability on it where you could replace something like the screen or the nvme drive or something like that if it breaks I mean thats going to this is going to be like a laptop that you can have around for five to six years easily lenovos warranty and customer service is really not too bad its maybe not quite as good as Dells but it is definitely better than Hewlett Packards and probably even like Acer and Asus although a series is pretty solid but nevertheless lenovos customer support is is pretty you know pretty standard across the board so thats good too I think that if youre a photographer and you like to take photos and then load those pictures onto your laptop and kind of edit on site or or just kind of have the laps out there sort of like a backup hard drive this things going to be perfect for that I think this is going to be perfect for audio editors dont really think its going to be that great for video editors you could maybe do some 1080p compressed stuff but yeah I might struggle a little bit not really for gamers either although it can do some light gaming but all in this is just a computer for like students and like business people this is like this is like the new everyday working mans ThinkPad anyway we were very very impressed with this Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 it gets a total score of 375 out of five now that may seem like a bad score but thats like thats like a B minus I mean thats like a very respectable score if they just maybe put in slightly better speakers or maybe just kind of made their keyboards slightly less weird than um I dont know itd be almost perfect one oh actually there is one little fun thing that I noticed on the Lenovo keyboard it says caps LK even though you have this honking big button they got cheap and didnt want to put like the O and the C for caps lock now I checked all the other Lenovo products that we have in the office and sure enough they all say caps LK whereas all of the hps and Dells and acers here all say caps lock thats just kind of a weird lenovoism apparently I never noticed it before in the like as long as Ive been reviewing these things but anyway its just kind of a fun thing to point out anyway I hope that this video was helpful let us know what you think

        "here we have the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 now in a world where a carton of eggs is reaching ten dollars you struggle to find a good deal on something and that goes for electronics as well but the idea of flex 5 is a reasonably priced machine coming in roughly at about 629 dollars and it offers a lot of bang for your buck at least on paper so what we want to do is find out if this Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 is any good and if you should buy one yourself and before we get started I would like to ask anybody that if you enjoyed this video please like And subscribe it really does help this channel a lot and helps us continue to deliver transparent and bias free content lets get some specs out of the way really quick this one comes with the AMD 5500u processor it comes with 16 gigabytes of ddr4 RAM and that is not user upgradable and it also comes with a 512 gigabyte nvme solid state drive which is user upgradeable pair that with AMD Radeon graphics and all in all youve got a very high performing computer for under 700 its hard to ask for a whole lot more but lets talk about the LCD screen for a little bit has a 14 inch LCD screen it is full high definition touch it is very colorful it is glossy it has about 300 nits of brightness which means that you can use it like on a college campus in a library inside next to an open window but youre probably going to struggle a little bit with direct sunlight right onto it also because it is so super glossy the viewing angles on it even though it is IPS there thwarted slightly you could certainly gather a crowd around it to watch a YouTube video or maybe even a movie possibly well get into that a little bit more later but that said though theyre the the glare on the screen is just maybe like like just like a little bit too its just its like theres a little bit of clear to be expected but its a really really nice panel we go ahead and rate it a four and a half out of Im sorry a four out of five now by the way everybody we have actually changed our rating system we used to do things out of 10 now were doing them out of five were kind of test running a little bit of a new rating system here anyway moving right along performance on this thing is Stellar we rate it about a four out of five now if we switch over here we went ahead and did some benchmarks opencl gets a 30 20 13 13 020 and then on the single core and multicore you have a 1099 and 5990 respectively and as usual on this channel those that want to know what that information means already know what it means so we will not describe what it means suffice is saying that practically speaking this laptop is exquisitely fast if you are doing like multiple Firefox tabs and chrome windows and email and word and PowerPoint and Excel and all that good stuff this thing will handle that with absolutely no problem at all gaming on this thing is going to be a little bit unusual its not a gaming computer but you could certainly play Minecraft in Roblox and some other games on Lower settings it shouldnt struggle with that at all but as far as like 4K raw video editing um youre probably going to want to stay away from that serviceability on the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 is fantastic you have a separate sister board here for the power button and then the two USB ports thats nice in case one of those goes out you only have to replace this one board you do have an nvme slot right here that is used to replaceable with something bigger if you want about really the only thing that takes a bit of a hit is the ram this one does come with 16 gigabytes but it is not upgradable Lenovo doesnt really give that option on a lot of their computers for some reason but um anyway its its other than that screen battery all that stuff is good to work with but while were on the subject of 4K raw video editing lets go ahead and talk about the input and output on this thing although before I do that were going to go ahead and switch over back to the nice little geometric shapes now input and output on this thing is a five out of five it is absolutely fantastic again especially for the price that youre buying this thing for on here you got two USB super speed ports type a uh one of theyre both one of them one of them is always on meaning that like if you had a cell phone or something that you wanted to charge while this thing is sleeping it can do that with no problem you have a fullsize SD card reader right here thats just the little power button and then on this side you have a trrs headphone jack basically microphones and headphones can plug into there you have a USBC 32 gen 1 Port I think it is it supports both power and data transfer on it as well basically you can charge the laptop on here and then you can also get 10 gigabytes per second data rates which is pretty nice youve got HDMI on here oh and by the way another little quick thing about the USBC Port you cannot put a display on it uh HDMI port for those that want to attach a monitor and then of course where you plug it in because it doesnt run on solar energy but where it lacks in solar charging capabilities it has absolutely phenomenal input and output especially for the price basically if you are a photo a photographer doing something on site um an audio production person basically somebody that has like a switchboard lots of microphones this kind of thing you are really not going to want for a whole lot more this thing will do photoshop with no problem it will do um audio processing with no brow problem you have again all those nice ports for things that you just want to attach to it and modularity and all that good stuff so yeah ports on this thing absolutely outstanding we really really appreciate lenovos efforts in the input and output now lets talk about the keyboard on this computer keyboard is a little bit of a mixed bag it is backlight which I really like the keys are very responsive and very tactile however this the keys on it are unusually wide now if you just look at them they look like normal laptop keys but if you were to actually take like a like some calipers and measure them out they are slightly wider than most other keyboard keys are and as a result you will find yourself accidentally hitting the question mark button which is also wider than the comma and the period button by like just a hair and youll also find yourself accidentally hitting the enter button as well it is not a deal breaker but if youre somebody that is like a super fast typist and youre used to other keyboards you will maybe find the transition to this keyboard to be a little bit awkward that said again it is backlit it does not have a fullsize numpad and it does just feel kind of good and firm to type on so were going to rate the keyboard three out of five its not its not great and its something that you could probably get used to but its its just something worth noting that Lenovo just did some weird stuff with the spacing on the keys and made it kind of weird unless unless youre like shin Lim and you just have like little magic fingers youre just gonna have to kind of get used to it its just weird trackpad on this thing though does get a four out of five it is actually pretty like graciously big and multigesture uh recognizes left and right clicks very well doesnt ghost too bad maybe just slightly and for that matter the trackpad also is like a slightly like little firmer than I wish Lenovo track pads tend to actually have a little bit of a lighter mechanical click than the Dell keyboards this or Dell track pads this one kind of feels more like a Dell track pad but that said it is a good track pad and those using it will have no problems whatsoever and then the last coverage on the sort of usability on this machine uh the touch the touch screen does have some active pen support in there too so those that want to use this thing as a notebook or a note taking machine will have no problem basically this thing just flips it just it can it converts like this and then it turns into like a little tablet that you could take some notes on if you were a student all right so I wanted to talk about the pen support really quick it is worth mentioning that this computer is one of the few computers and for that matter one of the few lenovos that actually comes with a pen comes with a little holster that you can clip to the computer and then it comes with an active Lenovo pen as well that is kind of a nice touch on lenovos part but basically you can convert this thing into a tablet here then obviously you can write on it so just put hello it is very responsive I mean again latency is really not bad but I just dont think reasonably speaking youre going to have anybody wanting to take notes with it the pen tip on it is just its a little too rubberized to make writing all that good so I mean you know your doing awesome I mean I dont know theyre just it just doesnt look all that good its a little clunky um you could obviously draw with this thing but you know ultimately I think people will be using this as maybe like an artistic pen and or tablet but probably not really much for notetaking that said Ive always kind of found that to be slightly gimmicky on some laptops and while it does have pen support and it is also accurate with like lower latency the best notetaking experience is probably going to be done on something like an iPad or a remarkable thats going to be like the most true to like pen and paper that you can get now lets talk about these speakers on this computer they are advertised to be Dolby audio and they are an absolute disaster we rate the speakers on here a one out of five they are tinny they have no character they dont get particularly loud and as I said earlier you can use the screen to like gather around with friends and watch a movie except that the speakers on this thing are so damn awful that nobody around the laptop would be able to hear it I theyre not the worst speakers Ive heard in a laptop but they are almost the worst speakers that I have heard in a laptop Lenovo should be ashamed of themselves now that said you do have the audio jack

fact heres what that footage looks like now this is a test of the webcam on the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 this is actually one of the better webcams we have tested in a while so color us impressed it has a little privacy shutter on the webcam as well so if youre one that wants to like walk around naked in front of their laptop but they dont want an only fans page then well then here you go youve got some privacy built in it also has a fingerprint reader it does not have a Windows hello compatible camera but it does have USBC charging it also has rapid charging basically meaning it can charge up pretty fast and then of course as I mentioned earlier it does have the 360 degree turned into a notebook tablet feature in there too so for the price at 630 bucks I mean I just really dont know what more youd want in there there are much more expensive laptops with less so thats why we always try to take into consideration the price bracket that the computer is sitting in when we give it a rating so yeah again for the price it absolutely earned its five out of five and for our final category the mobility category it gets a four and a four out of five I keep wanting to say four and a half out of five a four out of five should we do halves well maybe reach out in the comments section and find that out anyway Mobility on this thing its kind of heavy boy its a big boy its about 33 pounds so its not light but the materials are all incredibly well put together it just feels firm and like it can take a beating the Plastics are really really great quality the hinges are nice and smooth by all accounts I think that this thing could go from like laptop to desk or not from desk to backpack to airplane tray table to classroom back to your desk and like all all while getting rattled around with keys and tablets and charging cords and things and this thing would hold up really really well were very impressed with the quality of the materials that Lenovo decided to use with this thing again just some really really great Plastics and you know again there are more expensive laptops that are like cheaper built so they did a great job there battery life on it is going to be between about eight and a half to nine hours practically speaking and again for those that are traveling or running through airports or going to classrooms that is effectively allday battery life and you might get a little bit more if youre like only doing like word and and stuff like that but youll get a little bit less if youre doing something like internet browsing so yeah battery life on it is great materials on it are great its a little bit Hefty so I mean and in terms of like thickness and stuff I mean its kind of thick but like its not like its it had a couple it had too few many Christmas cookies but its still lightweight and compact enough where you can just Chuck it into a briefcase and maybe your Mystery Ranch briefcase or Tokyo bellroy and then youll be right as rain so again all in all earns its four and a half out of five now who is this last top four we really feel that this laptop is for like business people that like to travel a lot uh it is also for people that just need a solid productivity Powerhouse and they dont really mind the slightly smaller screen after all 14 inch screens are my favorite form factor but that said if you dont need the 15 or the 16 inch screens and you just need something kind of nice and Compact and lightweight to sit on your desk and just do its thing this is absolutely perfect for it frankly even nonprofits could do pretty well with this laptop and again at 630 bucks you really get like I mean you get a lot of bang for your buck and because of the serviceability on it where you could replace something like the screen or the nvme drive or something like that if it breaks I mean thats going to this is going to be like a laptop that you can have around for five to six years easily lenovos warranty and customer service is really not too bad its maybe not quite as good as Dells but it is definitely better than Hewlett Packards and probably even like Acer and Asus although a series is pretty solid but nevertheless lenovos customer support is is pretty you know pretty standard across the board so thats good too I think that if youre a photographer and you like to take photos and then load those pictures onto your laptop and kind of edit on site or or just kind of have the laps out there sort of like a backup hard drive this things going to be perfect for that I think this is going to be perfect for audio editors dont really think its going to be that great for video editors you could maybe do some 1080p compressed stuff but yeah I might struggle a little bit not really for gamers either although it can do some light gaming but all in this is just a computer for like students and like business people this is like this is like the new everyday working mans ThinkPad anyway we were very very impressed with this Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 it gets a total score of 375 out of five now that may seem like a bad score but thats like thats like a B minus I mean thats like a very respectable score if they just maybe put in slightly better speakers or maybe just kind of made their keyboards slightly less weird than um I dont know itd be almost perfect one oh actually there is one little fun thing that I noticed on the Lenovo keyboard it says caps LK even though you have this honking big button they got cheap and didnt want to put like the O and the C for caps lock now I checked all the other Lenovo products that we have in the office and sure enough they all say caps LK whereas all of the hps and Dells and acers here all say caps lock thats just kind of a weird lenovoism apparently I never noticed it before in the like as long as Ive been reviewing these things but anyway its just kind of a fun thing to point out anyway I hope that this video was helpful let us know what you think about the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 reach out to us in the comments section if you have any questions or comments please like And subscribe please tell your friends about this Channel and we will be back with another video really soon",
        "I use mine for doing online classes and writing editing my novels sometimes using it as a tablet to watch YouTube on the go on a larger screen than my phone In tablet mode its also great for playing board games like chess backgammon online poker etc with the stylus",
        "Ive had this laptop for a year and a half now for school From my student experience it works really well the pen does feel wonky at first but it smoothens out after a few uses and now I have no wonky feeling when using the pen Ive completely transitioned away from notebooks and only using OneNote for all my notetaking 100 recommend for students who mainly use their laptop for music note taking and Youtube"

        "here we have the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 now in a world where a carton of eggs is reaching ten dollars you struggle to find a good deal on something and that goes for electronics as well but the idea of flex 5 is a reasonably priced machine coming in roughly at about 629 dollars and it offers a lot of bang for your buck at least on paper so what we want to do is find out if this Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 is any good and if you should buy one yourself and before we get started I would like to ask anybody that if you enjoyed this video please like And subscribe it really does help this channel a lot and helps us continue to deliver transparent and bias free content lets get some specs out of the way really quick this one comes with the AMD 5500u processor it comes with 16 gigabytes of ddr4 RAM and that is not user upgradable and it also comes with a 512 gigabyte nvme solid state drive which is user upgradeable pair that with AMD Radeon graphics and all in all youve got a very high performing computer for under 700 its hard to ask for a whole lot more but lets talk about the LCD screen for a little bit has a 14 inch LCD screen it is full high definition touch it is very colorful it is glossy it has about 300 nits of brightness which means that you can use it like on a college campus in a library inside next to an open window but youre probably going to struggle a little bit with direct sunlight right onto it also because it is so super glossy the viewing angles on it even though it is IPS there thwarted slightly you could certainly gather a crowd around it to watch a YouTube video or maybe even a movie possibly well get into that a little bit more later but that said though theyre the the glare on the screen is just maybe like like just like a little bit too its just its like theres a little bit of clear to be expected but its a really really nice panel we go ahead and rate it a four and a half out of Im sorry a four out of five now by the way everybody we have actually changed our rating system we used to do things out of 10 now were doing them out of five were kind of test running a little bit of a new rating system here anyway moving right along performance on this thing is Stellar we rate it about a four out of five now if we switch over here we went ahead and did some benchmarks opencl gets a 30 20 13 13 020 and then on the single core and multicore you have a 1099 and 5990 respectively and as usual on this channel those that want to know what that information means already know what it means so we will not describe what it means suffice is saying that practically speaking this laptop is exquisitely fast if you are doing like multiple Firefox tabs and chrome windows and email and word and PowerPoint and Excel and all that good stuff this thing will handle that with absolutely no problem at all gaming on this thing is going to be a little bit unusual its not a gaming computer but you could certainly play Minecraft in Roblox and some other games on Lower settings it shouldnt struggle with that at all but as far as like 4K raw video editing um youre probably going to want to stay away from that serviceability on the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 is fantastic you have a separate sister board here for the power button and then the two USB ports thats nice in case one of those goes out you only have to replace this one board you do have an nvme slot right here that is used to replaceable with something bigger if you want about really the only thing that takes a bit of a hit is the ram this one does come with 16 gigabytes but it is not upgradable Lenovo doesnt really give that option on a lot of their computers for some reason but um anyway its its other than that screen battery all that stuff is good to work with but while were on the subject of 4K raw video editing lets go ahead and talk about the input and output on this thing although before I do that were going to go ahead and switch over back to the nice little geometric shapes now input and output on this thing is a five out of five it is absolutely fantastic again especially for the price that youre buying this thing for on here you got two USB super speed ports type a uh one of theyre both one of them one of them is always on meaning that like if you had a cell phone or something that you wanted to charge while this thing is sleeping it can do that with no problem you have a fullsize SD card reader right here thats just the little power button and then on this side you have a trrs headphone jack basically microphones and headphones can plug into there you have a USBC 32 gen 1 Port I think it is it supports both power and data transfer on it as well basically you can charge the laptop on here and then you can also get 10 gigabytes per second data rates which is pretty nice youve got HDMI on here oh and by the way another little quick thing about the USBC Port you cannot put a display on it uh HDMI port for those that want to attach a monitor and then of course where you plug it in because it doesnt run on solar energy but where it lacks in solar charging capabilities it has absolutely phenomenal input and output especially for the price basically if you are a photo a photographer doing something on site um an audio production person basically somebody that has like a switchboard lots of microphones this kind of thing you are really not going to want for a whole lot more this thing will do photoshop with no problem it will do um audio processing with no brow problem you have again all those nice ports for things that you just want to attach to it and modularity and all that good stuff so yeah ports on this thing absolutely outstanding we really really appreciate lenovos efforts in the input and output now lets talk about the keyboard on this computer keyboard is a little bit of a mixed bag it is backlight which I really like the keys are very responsive and very tactile however this the keys on it are unusually wide now if you just look at them they look like normal laptop keys but if you were to actually take like a like some calipers and measure them out they are slightly wider than most other keyboard keys are and as a result you will find yourself accidentally hitting the question mark button which is also wider than the comma and the period button by like just a hair and youll also find yourself accidentally hitting the enter button as well it is not a deal breaker but if youre somebody that is like a super fast typist and youre used to other keyboards you will maybe find the transition to this keyboard to be a little bit awkward that said again it is backlit it does not have a fullsize numpad and it does just feel kind of good and firm to type on so were going to rate the keyboard three out of five its not its not great and its something that you could probably get used to but its its just something worth noting that Lenovo just did some weird stuff with the spacing on the keys and made it kind of weird unless unless youre like shin Lim and you just have like little magic fingers youre just gonna have to kind of get used to it its just weird trackpad on this thing though does get a four out of five it is actually pretty like graciously big and multigesture uh recognizes left and right clicks very well doesnt ghost too bad maybe just slightly and for that matter the trackpad also is like a slightly like little firmer than I wish Lenovo track pads tend to actually have a little bit of a lighter mechanical click than the Dell keyboards this or Dell track pads this one kind of feels more like a Dell track pad but that said it is a good track pad and those using it will have no problems whatsoever and then the last coverage on the sort of usability on this machine uh the touch the touch screen does have some active pen support in there too so those that want to use this thing as a notebook or a note taking machine will have no problem basically this thing just flips it just it can it converts like this and then it turns into like a little tablet that you could take some notes on if you were a student all right so I wanted to talk about the pen support really quick it is worth mentioning that this computer is one of the few computers and for that matter one of the few lenovos that actually comes with a pen comes with a little holster that you can clip to the computer and then it comes with an active Lenovo pen as well that is kind of a nice touch on lenovos part but basically you can convert this thing into a tablet here then obviously you can write on it so just put hello it is very responsive I mean again latency is really not bad but I just dont think reasonably speaking youre going to have anybody wanting to take notes with it the pen tip on it is just its a little too rubberized to make writing all that good so I mean you know your doing awesome I mean I dont know theyre just it just doesnt look all that good its a little clunky um you could obviously draw with this thing but you know ultimately I think people will be using this as maybe like an artistic pen and or tablet but probably not really much for notetaking that said Ive always kind of found that to be slightly gimmicky on some laptops and while it does have pen support and it is also accurate with like lower latency the best notetaking experience is probably going to be done on something like an iPad or a remarkable thats going to be like the most true to like pen and paper that you can get now lets talk about these speakers on this computer they are advertised to be Dolby audio and they are an absolute disaster we rate the speakers on here a one out of five they are tinny they have no character they dont get particularly loud and as I said earlier you can use the screen to like gather around with friends and watch a movie except that the speakers on this thing are so damn awful that nobody around the laptop would be able to hear it I theyre not the worst speakers Ive heard in a laptop but they are almost the worst speakers that I have heard in a laptop Lenovo should be ashamed of themselves now that said you do have the audio jack on the side of it so of course you can pop in a set of external speakers or headphones and it wont be an issue whatsoever but thats said its almost like they went out of their way to put the junkiest part spin speakers in there and then slaps a Dolby badge on there why do manufacturers insist on Advertising good speakers on them when they just they just put crap in there so anyway one out of five now lets talk about the features of this computer which are shockingly fantastic we give it a five out of five it has Wireless ax or 6 in it it has Bluetooth it has a very respectable webcam in it in fact heres what that footage looks like now this is a test of the webcam on the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 this is actually one of the better webcams we have tested in a while so color us impressed it has
