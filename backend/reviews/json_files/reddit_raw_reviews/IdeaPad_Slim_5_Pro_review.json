  "Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5i v Lenovo Yoga Pro 7?  \n\nConsidering these two laptops and wondering what people's opinions are on them? Needing a new laptop for work, personal use and, not essential but a bit of light gaming (very occasionally play games like Rome 2 Total War).\n\n[Buy LENOVO IdeaPad Slim 5i 14\" Laptop - Intel® Core™ i7, 1 TB SSD, Abyss Blue | Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/lenovo-ideapad-slim-5i-14-laptop-intel-core-i7-1-tb-ssd-abyss-blue-10250702.html)\n\n[Buy LENOVO Yoga Pro 7 14.5\" Laptop - Intel® Core™ i7, 512 GB SSD, Storm Grey | Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/lenovo-yoga-pro-7-14.5-laptop-intel-core-i7-512-gb-ssd-storm-grey-10249236.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was also half considering the Dell XPS 13, although the reviews seem mixed and it's slightly above my ideal price range but if it's vastly superior would maybe spend the extra money... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers. \n\n&#x200B;",
  "CHALLENGE THE INTERNET TO FIND ME A BETTER LAPTOP AT THIS PRICE. **I HAVE FOUND THE BEST LAPTOP WITH THIS PRICE POINT.**\n\nToday, I challenge the entire internet's tech-savvy folks to find me a laptop with these specs at this price point. If you do, I will personally apologize and mention your username at the top of this post, stating the laptop you found, along with a personal message of your choice. 😬\n\n*RULE: Small, lesser-known laptop companies don't count because most people don't buy from them. ❌*  \n*(But feel free to give them a mention)*\n\nLook, I live in Malaysia. Are laptops cheaper here than in the US? More or less the same, I believe. I know for a fact that smartphones are more expensive in Malaysia. I'm not that informed about the trade rules and such for importing electronics into Malaysia, so if someone wanna drop facts. Be my guest. ☝️🤓  \n[](https://www.lenovo.com/my/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83HYCTO1WWMY1)\n\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n# The laptop: [Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 (16'', Gen 10)](https://www.lenovo.com/my/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83HYCTO1WWMY1)\n\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n**Review by another guy with the same laptop and specs:**  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDealsIndia/comments/1nsfvxp/bought\\_lenovo\\_ideapad\\_slim\\_5\\_and\\_here\\_is\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDealsIndia/comments/1nsfvxp/bought_lenovo_ideapad_slim_5_and_here_is_the/)\n\n**YouTube review of the laptop, but the specs in the reviewed laptop are different because of just how customizable this laptop is:**  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWoVMdo3ac&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWoVMdo3ac&t)\n\n*\\*As of writing this, I have not purchased* this *laptop. I am waiting till the end of this month for Black Friday deals.*\n\nThis laptop is customizable to your preferences. I have chosen my specs, which have increased the price; you can indeed get this laptop cheaper if you select lower spec options. *🤑*\n\n# My Specs:\n\n* **Processor:** AMD Ryzen™ AI 7 350 Processor (2.00 GHz up to 5.00 GHz)\n* **Memory:** 32 GB DDR5-5600MT/s (SODIMM) - (2 x 16 GB)\n* **Display:** 16\" 2.8K (2880 x 1800), OLED, Glare, Non-Touch, HDR 1000 True Black, 100% DCI-P3, 500 nits, 120Hz\n* **Solid State Drive:** 512 GB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe Gen4 TLC\n* **Camera:** 1080P FHD IR Hybrid with Dual Microphone\n* **Graphic Card:** AMD Radeon™ 860M (Integrated Graphics)\n* **Wireless:** Wi-Fi 7 2x2 BE 160MHz & Bluetooth® 5.4\n* **Battery:** 3 Cell Rechargeable Li-ion 60Wh\n* **Power Cord:** 100W USB-C Slim 90% PCC 3-pin AC Adapter - UK\n\nI have selected the no operating system option because I can save more money on this laptop by either using the free version of Windows or buying a cheaper Windows 11 Pro license key from a site like Whokeys. Not a lot of laptops have this option, so we might as well take advantage of it, am I right? 🤔\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlh6ab3n2k0g1.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=8074d26cf27bc4a88874acbc6d1ae2a215dd48bb\n\n# PRICE?\n\n>!**USD 884.15 or RM3677.64**!< *(This is the MYR price converted into USD to give you folks that are not from Malaysia an idea of the price I'm getting this laptop for. The actual Lenovo US version of this laptop may be more expensive, Idk) 🤷‍♂️*\n\nThis price is from the 11.11 sale in Malaysia. The actual non-sale price is slightly more expensive, but then again, considering how rarely you purchase a laptop, it would be stupid to not wait for a sale to buy. I'm assuming Black Friday will give an even bigger discount. Plus, Lenovo offers discounts for students in high school or college. So if you buy smart, you can get this laptop for even cheaper, making it even more of a steal. 😎",
  "Nice try, but flattery will get you nowhere.",
  "Out of these laptops, which is the best option? Basically, my sister is heading into college, and needs a laptop. They gave us a voucher, and we're able to choose between only these 5 laptops. I'm trying to help her, and I think that the HP one is the best one, but i'd like some help just in case. So, which is the best option?",
  "None buy a second hand laptop for half the price and double the specs",
  "The Asus or the Lenovo Ideapad.",
  "The Ideapad Slim 3",
  "Lenovo or if u want bigger screen hp. But these are really bad processors. These will prob go to 💩 in 2 or 3 yrs.",
  "Why can't your just go used instead",
  "IdeaPad looks decent, it could be a modern i3",
  "We can't do that. These laptops basically cost us nothing, so its either one of these or nothing.",
  "yeah, but shes currently on a celeron so basically anything is better",
  "voucher is only for this site",
  "What laptop should I buy? Hey everyone! I’m planning to buy a new laptop soon, and I could really use some advice before making the final decision. My budget is around **$600 USD** or less, and I’m looking for a laptop that performs well, looks good, and works smoothly for daily tasks. I mainly need it for **work**, which involves a lot of **video calls**, so a decent **built-in webcam** is actually one of my top priorities. I also tend to have multiple apps and browser tabs open at once, so smooth **multitasking** is really important to me.\n\nOutside of work, I’d like the laptop to handle some casual gaming from time to time. It would be nice if it could run a few games comfortably without overheating or lagging. I also spend a fair amount of time streaming shows and videos, editing documents and presentations, and maybe doing some basic photo or video editing here and there when needed. Overall, I’m looking for a laptop that can handle everyday tasks with ease while still being enjoyable and comfortable to use.\n\nI’ve already done a bit of research and found a few models that seem to fit my needs, but I’m still not sure which one offers the best overall value. I’ll list them below with their prices, along with some quick notes on what I’ve found so far, but I’d love to hear your thoughts or any recommendations you might have.\n\n**$450 USD Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15IAH8**\\- 15.6\" FHD (TN, 250 nits) Intel Core i5-12450H (8 cores, 12 threads), 8GB (soldered) DDR5, 512GB SSD M.2 2242, 1080p Webcam, WiFi 6 , Bluetooth 5.2 , Windows 11 Home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the laptop's material feels cheap, it gets hot quickly, and the battery doesn't last long. It also struggles with gaming and can shut down randomly. While positive reviews say the image quality and Dolby audio are decent, and the camera is great for video calls. The performance is acceptable for work and school. It opens programs fast and charges quickly.\n\nThe second laptop is the same Lenovo laptop but it's the one with an **AMD Ryzen 5 7520U** processor, it does have some other differences so these are the full specs: AMD Ryzen 5 7520U (4C/8T, 2.8/4.3GHz, 2MB L2/4MB L3) 16GB RAM | 512GB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe | 15.6\" matte screen | Windows 11 Home (and Pro on another site). Camera: HD 720p with a privacy shutter.\n\nNegative reviews say that the display isn’t very bright, that it lacks touch functionality, and that the colors have a slight greenish tint. They trash the webcam, saying it's only 720p and not great. The hinge goes all the way back, and the keyboard isn’t backlit. The fan can get noisy during gameplay too.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has an impressive battery life, lasting about 10-11 hours with regular use. The 1080p display is decent, and the built-in speakers sound pretty good. The keyboard is snappy, and the large trackpad is accurate. It has a fingerprint reader for extra security, and you can even open the laptop with one hand.\n\n**$550 Acer Aspire Lite** 15.6\" FHD, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 8 cores Windows 11 Home | integrated AMD Radeon Graphics. DDR4 3200 MHz M.2 PCLE NVMe.\n\nAccording to some reviews, the battery life isn't that good, like 4-5 hours. This is the laptop that the sales clerk recommended. They said the camera quality is decent (like a normal one you would get at this price range).\n\n**$530 ASUS Vivobook Go 15** | AMD Ryzen 5 7520U | 16GB | 512GB SSD | 15.6\" | Windows 11 Home | 2.8GHz (6MB Cache, up to 4.3GHz, 4 cores, 8 Threads) FHD 60 Hz AMD Radeon Web Camera 720p.\n\nNegative reviews say that the fans are slightly loud. It's not suitable for video and photo editing. The webcam is mediocre, not the best one, basically.\n\nPositive reviews say that the battery lasts 7 hours and it charges fully in 1 hour. One review even said that the webcam quality was decent enough.\n\n**$550 ASUS Vivobook 15** AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 16 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM 512 GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD 8 cores integrated AMD Radeon Graphics - 15.6″ FHD windows 11 home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the battery life is not quite long enough to last a full day of work or classes. 1080p display has a cool tint, and it’s heavy at 3.8 pounds.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has above-average build quality and, reliable fingerprint reader on its trackpad. Its backlit keyboard was quiet and satisfying to type on, and its trackpad worked well.\n\nI don't know if this changes anything, but I'm based in Latin America, so do with that information what you will. Thank you in advance!",

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",

  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Need a system for productivity, VM work, and light gaming with good battery I get into a lot of network simulation like GNS3 and EveNG to run network devices and systems VMs. I also am taking some online ethical hacking courses that uses a lot of VMs for Linux and windows. I don’t like staying plugged in all the time, so I’m trying to find a good mix.\n\nLast year i bought the Yoga Slim 9i 16” and it was fantastic except the battery. That was a joke. It would die with casual use within 2-3 hours or less, and that was with me turning down settings and going to 60hz. If that’s how it needs to be used, what’s the point of all the extra power and features? So I sold it. My 15” MacBook Air M2 has been working out for productivity, but I really need a Windows system back for my VM and simulation stuff. I also miss gaming a little here and there. \n\nI am just not sure what will end up being more important to me feature wise (screen, weight, battery, dGPU etc). I am looking at three systems and leaning towards AMD for battery life, but the Core Ultra 9 185h has more cores for VM work and seems to do ok on battery depending on the system. I also love a good screen, but I don’t do a lot of media consumption really. I don’t know I will actually take advantage of miniLED/OLED or not.\n\nThree systems:\nLenovo Yoga Pro 9 w/o miniLED 32Gb, Intel 185H, 4050 (IPS version is on sale for 1299 at Best Buy. The miniLED version is $600 more because it isn’t on sale, and that’s too much extra)\nLenovo Thinkpad P16s Gen 2 w/ 7840u, 64gb ram, 1tb SSD, 4k OLED 60hz New in Box for $910 (AMD does ok casual gaming, so no dGPU is ok but I kinda prefer one)\nLenovo Ideapad Pro 5 w/ Intel Ultra 9 185H, 32Gb ram, 4050, 2k OLED 120hz refurbished for $850. (Has mixed reviews and a loud track which can annoy me)\n\nI am also trying to stick to under $1500.\n\nIf anybody else knows of something, my needs are:\n16” Nice screen w/ higher resolution (doesn’t have to be 4k) don’t care about high refresh rate on laptops. I’ve had it, and it didn’t much for me.\n32-64GB of ram (VMs take up a lot of ram)\nMany CORES (Ultra 9 has more than 8840U or HS, but not sure how much that will impact VM use)\nGood battery life without having to make it feel like a $300 laptop in features.\nNumberpad - Inputting IP address on a top row of keys is horrible. I have to do that some when i work remote for my job since my work laptop is 14”\n\nThere are a ton of options that fit all of this except battery life. It sucks to constantly worry about plugging in to keep working. I wanted the new Ryzen Ai 370 but there are no systems that meet my criteria except one new MSi system that is priced too high for the specs. I wish I didn’t want the numpad, but I really need it.\n",
  "Gaming laptops heat issues Looking on the Lenovo web store for LOQ options I came across the new Ideapad Pro 5 that has RTX 3050 graphic card (16\" has upgrade option of 4050). The machine is slim, all metal, runs a Ryzen 7 cpu, and doesnt appear to have anywhere near the vents that a LOQ has. I can see where air goes in, but cant see where it comes out.\n\nThe few review vids that I found didn't really mention heat at all, like its just not a thing to bother with. No dramatic thermal images etc.\n\nSo I'm trying to understand why? Why does a business laptop with discreet graphics tick along just fine while gaming laptops have heat concerns despite air vents all over?",

Ideapad 5 Pro 14:  5800u, 2,8k IPS Screen, 16gb RAM, MX450\n\n2. Yoga Slim 7 Pro 14: i5 1240p, 2,8k IPS Screen, 16Gb RAM, without dgpu.\n\nThe key difference between them both is the processor, but since i couldn't find a reliable source for benchmarks or reviews for the i5 1240p i can't really decide between them both.

  "the 12th gen intel should both perform slightly better and be efficient thanks to performance and efficiency cores",
  "Thanks for your response! I was thinking the same, but then i saw some user tested benchmarks and they seem to be slightly lower than the 5800u and much lower than what I've seen  previously on some leaks. But because there are no real reviews yet it is a nightmare for me to decide.",
  "what ive seen on geekbench is intel performing better, but yeah, with new cpu's its hard to tell exactly",
  "I saw that too! The i5 seems to have a single core score of about 1640 i believe which would be really awesome but at the same time it shows me that the i7 1260p has a geekbench score of only 1499 which just can't be true.",

  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",

  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues. And if anyone has solved the above issues i'd like to know how to fix it. (I tried bloat removal and even windows reinstall but the issue still persists)",

I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve.

If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",
  "Its actually not too bad in person (at best buy) when viewed side by side to the book 4 screen.   I think the book 5 screen has more anti-reflective coating and they did not have that model for testing.",

  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast. The screen is very glossy though. if you work in a very bright room with bright background/light behind you, then yeah it can be very annoying to clearly see your reflection on the screen even at 80% brightness. it's depends see if you can find a sample in the nearest store.",

  "My bluetooth is awful.  I can pair all devices, but they will NOT stay connected.  My earbuds connected, and I was able to use them for about 1 minute or so, but I could only get the Right side to receive sound.

  "You could try to check if the problem is related to your Windows install, or a hardware issue (e.g. WiFi chip, antenna connection). \n\nOne relatively easy way would be to create a Linux bootable USB stick (e.g. Ubuntu). Boot up from the Linux USB stick and check the WiFi speeds. \n\nIf the speeds in Linux are normal, you could then try a \"clean install\" of Windows (download Windows USB install media from Microsoft website).\n\nIf the WiFi speed in Linux is also very low, then it might be worth opening up the laptop and checking the WiFi chip and antennas (does not void warranty). Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",

  "The 9i looks like a nice machine especially with mini-LED, but the chassis is quite cheaply made, like the Pro 7. All plastic interior, including the hinge assembly.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

  "hi I am someone using this laptop for a month. Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo. I have a desktop that goes 165hz and that's more for gaming. sure it's smooth and all but eh not worth the batt life tradeoff).\n\nif you realllly wanna stretch the life, use MS edge as ur browser cuz that's the least battery draining browser out there.

Unfortunately, she decided return the laptop after just one week as the case kept splitting open at the front under the touchpad. This indicates some poor built quality. I tried it out myself for a bit and also found the feeling and aesthetics rather on the cheap and plasticky side. The system also felt very sluggish and performed poorly in everyday web browsing and office tasks.\n\nAfter the MSI Prestige, I recommended my friend to get a full aluminium Lenovo Yoga 7i 14\" instead.

  "Asus ASUS ProArt P16 review. I think it's one of the best laptops in the market for creators. I've had the ProArt P16 review for almost 1 month now and I am impressed. It runs great, feels and runs like a premium device. I bought it for work and personal projects and I'm honestly happy with what I got. \n\nSpecs and Performance 10/10  - The P16 comes with an RTX4070 which is a solid graphics card. The CPU is AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 HX 370 which trumps and out performs the other top of the line CPU the intel ultra 9. The display is one of my favorite things about it, it's a 4K 16” 4K 60HZ OLED touchscreen. It can run anything and everything smoothly no matter what I'm doing. I can export high quality content faster then anything I've seen on my previous laptops. \n\nMUSETREE and ProArt Creator Hub 8/10 - Musetree has no subscription fees. Before I read that, i planned on ignoring the program. I have to say it's an amazing piece of software and I love that ASUS made it available. I've abandoned  programs like Riffusion and others in the same genre after trying out Musetree.\n\nI'm not a fan of the armory crate but thankfully Asus has the ProArt Creator hub to replace it and I think they did justice with it. While I don't recommend it for experienced veterans in the art and music industry. I do think it's good for beginners.\n\nLooks and graphics - The 4K OLED HDR display is beautiful and the image quality amazes me. I can work and focus on the tiniest details. Working with anything life like is another experience. The display really makes it worth it.  The speakers caught my attention. There are a total of 2 speakers, each built it to the sides of the keyboard. I was surprised at how good the sound is. Theres no distortion, no issues. It's feels almost perfect, like when and my friends go to the studio. \n\nBattery and cooling 9/10 - The P16 is at best warm. You can work all day without it getting hot. That being said, if you decide to game. It does get hot on the top side of the laptop. Above the keyboard and speakers. It is very noticeable to the touch. \n\nThe battery is pretty great for working, it will last you hours. If you decide to game... then it's just like any other gaming laptop when it comes to battery life.\n\n\n\nGaming and the display are fantastic on this laptop. I've never had a laptop that would boot up this fast, that would have 0 issues in every possible way when it came to working and gaming. Badly optimized programs and uncompressed videos are nothing when it comes to this laptop. and games run smooth, the experience is just on another level, and it is a future proofed laptop. Everything is so beautiful and on another level.\n\nThe P16 came with 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate that is NOT trial bound, so anyone can use it. \n\nTLDR - New owner of the ASUS ProArt P16  and had to share how amazing it and is and how much I have enjoyed it so far.\n\n\n\nThe model - ProArt P16 (H7606); Copilot+ PC - H7606WI",
  "it is *nearly* perfect. the glossy screen is not for creators. its for consumers. I contemplate returning it every day because of the super stupid reflections. It's unacceptable for creators. maddening because other than that it is spot-fucking-on Edit: one more thing, I liked the dial idea a generation back, this touchpad's halfway nonsense aint it.",
  "I'm really happy for you, lol kind of hate you for taking that pic like that though would love to see more of it.",
  "Damn, this looks sweet. Wonder if they have a 120Hz version",
  "I have mine for about a month now, loving how light it is when commuting. Programs run well but there’s a few little issues I came across. \n\nFirst week of using it I came across the blue screen of death but somehow it fixed itself.\n\nEvery time I unplug and run on battery the screen flickers on and off. \n\nThere’s been a few times the laptop turned off and took awhile to turn back on . Not sure what’s going on there.\n\nGames run well and the 60Hz does not bother me at all.",

  "Any idea on if and when there will be a newer model released? I am about to purchase one of these (I am about 90% convinced currently) But I could easily wait another 6 months before I pull the trigger and I would rather have the latest and greatest as you don't buy laptops very often.",

  "I always wish they’d get a few shots of the laptop then of the side of the box with specs.. so I can really round it out without looking up model numbers.",
  "No. The PX13 and P16 both have professional 3K/4k OLED screens that are capable of 100%+ color accuracy in every category. They don't make panels like that over 60hz unfortunately. Apparently when you raise the refresh rate on these panels, you lose color accuracy. These laptops are for photo and video editing, modeling, and other \"creative\" purposes first. Gaming is not their primary purpose. The Zephyrus G14 and G16 line is made for that.",

I might sell this for a new one as well, but I fear they won't add any kind of appropriate MATTE display, which would be the only reason for me to do that.

The parts that are imperfect are so bad I want to throw it out the window. \n\n**As a Creator laptop:**\n\n**The Good:**\n\n- build quality \n\n- amount, type, and location of ports are perfect. should be standard.\n\n- 4k+ resolution, another thing that should be standard\n\n- battery life (once bloatware and g-helper are sorted)\n\n- led placement and purpose, surprisingly. \n\n- All the hardware is well thought out (yes I'm saying this twice, don't change it!)\n\n\n**The Bad:**\n\n- the touch version of the Aus Dial is beyond useless, it needs to be physical like the original. \n\n- The asus software is silly and bloated. they have around 9 apps and services that can be replaced by g-helper, thankfully.\n\n- The finish (I think there is only black?) is not only a fingerprint and dust magnet, it should be used in police forensics to collect dna. I have to wipe down before and after each use, sometimes with isopropyl. I have never had a laptop this bad (and I've owned a lot)\n\n**The Horrific (should be in prison for implementing):**\n\n\n- the glossy screen. It's a mirror. It WILL give you headaches. It is so bad matte screen protectors do nothing to dim the reflections.\n\n\n- The Soldered, unchangeable RAM. This is a pure cash grab by the industry (thanks apple c!nts), and for creators, it is cutting us off at the knees. \n\n\n- The MAX ram, the highest end unit is capped at 64gb.\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nAs a Gamer Laptop\n\n- Don't buy. look at razer and g14/16.\n\nEdit: My use case is 3d modeling/animation/photography/video editing/gaming/game design...

Other than a shit ton of updates I’ve had to do, along with some screen flickering before it tells me it needs to update, it’s seemed pretty good. I agree the glossy screen is kind of annoying tho in a bright room.",
  "Thank you for the all the info!  This is very helpful - I was hoping the asus dial was more functional as the hardware piece looked clunky, but that's a shame this version doesn't work out. Also a huge bummer on the screen reflection...\n\nI'm torn...currently on a video call and trying to do passive work in the meantime and my machine is slower than I'd prefer (deleting text and typing text is now slower than normal)- and it's nothing monumental, just a bunch of sheets and images opened for post scheduling. \n\nI've been Pixel and Windows since the beginning and am really trying to not have to make the switch to apple, but after getting the 8a (feel like I stepped back in time with this) and seeing any Windows laptop close to the Macbook Pro and the issues associated with them, I'm as close as I've ever been to switching.",
  "Hello, I am working with unreal engine 5. The processor sees 95 degrees. Is it normal? Will I have any problems? Or is proart p16 enough? Do you think I should change it?",

  "that flicker is the gpu, adjust your setting to keep it on or off depending on what power mode your on. The automatic loop is a tpm issue from what i’ve read. Update your bios to 3.12, I was able to access mine through troubleshoot mode>bios then i updated and it fixed the issue.",
  "I wish they could overlap more in the processor switch. The flicker is really annoying and I'm disappointed the reviewers didn't mentioned",
  "Thanks for your response",
  "I ended up going with the MSI Creator 16 AI. I've not usb-c tested it yet but I'm assuming it's like my old MSI and also trash on usb-pc",
  "I FINALLY installed one from viascreens- the matte p16 one. It came with 2 screens, and a link to a details install video. Nice product and shipped securely. \n\nI took a photo right before I put it on, [and still can't believe they made it so reflective \\(cheaper\\)](https://i.imgur.com/U7CveQx.jpeg). It is really bad, as we've said countless times. but jesus it's like a freaking mirror. \n\nSo, I followed the directions to a T, it took 20-30 minutes and the 'matte' protector reduced reflections by only about 15% *maybe* 20% That sounds ok, but it is not nearly enough AND introduced an unreal amount of speckle ([here's a shot](https://i.imgur.com/yHehk3D.jpeg), I took the photo quickly since the camera couldn't focus too well with all the moiré). \n\nI could've lived with 1/2 the speckle and 2x as much glare reduction. But as it is? I took it off after 15 minutes. Too many tradeoffs. \n\nHope this helps!",

  "I was in the same boat, however apple has reflective screens and their memory, and more importantly, hard drive limitations, are a no-go.\n\nI suggest trying it out! I know I am being very negative on a few things, but it is as close to perfect (especially for the price) as you will get right now. For example, for all my bitching, I still use mine and don't plan on selling it unless someone comes along with a 4k matte screen on a thin device like this. I just hope enough people mention these things, Asus hears, and addresses them down the line. \n\nYou might even love it because now your expectations are tempered (I was wildly hyped coming from a g14). \n\nGood luck and let me know what you end up doing!",
  "Oh that'd be even better!",
  "seems like user error, set your settings properly and it shouldn't be a issue.",
  "Thanks for trying it out and letting me know! Definitely a shame it didn’t work. And a shame the screen is so reflective.",
  "Hi! Interior designer here. Do you know if game design requires same laptop specs for architecture/interior design? I assume it is.

  "They are set properly at the moment. The flicker is now when it's plugged in, like yours, and most of my use is not on battery. So it's very annoying",
  "so when plugged in, it flickers more then once when you are using it?",
  "Yep but nowhere near as much as before. I removed bloatware and modify settings now through G helper, updated drivers manually, and turned off hardware acceleration in apps. Even when I'm using something that relies on the dgpu when plugged in like Davinci, the flicker still happens. Used to be a few times a minute and now it's once every 5 minutes. Which adds up over the course of a few hours of work. I turned off V sync and that helped a lot but then affects my video editing though. \n\nMaking progress using everyone's recommendations and I won't return this laptop, but it's getting there.",

  "I have one but with sadly a ryzen 7 7735hs and not an AI 7 350. But I have all maxed out options.\n\nIt's an absolute BANGER of a laptop. It's very light and thin, build quality is pretty good and the OLED is really bright. \n\nPerformance wise it performs as you'd expect from the specs as far as mine is concerned, but i can't tell for the RAI7 version obviously. \n\nKeyboard is good as well. The integrated microphone is *extremely* good for a laptop, hands down best laptop mic I've heard. I'm running Linux on it, it's very well supported and everything works as expected except the mic which needs a kernel edit to work (I've sent a patch a month or so ago, but i think it got forgotten :/ )\n\nIn the bios you can dedicate from 256mb to 4gb to the igpu. However the bios is fairly limited in terms of what you can do in it.\n\nNow that I know the ryzen ai 7 version exists I'm sad I didn't wait :( \n\nOh and one last thing, at least with mine I bundled a 2year accidental damage warranty for 35€ which is nice, idk if that's still available but it's a nice to know.",

I get 5 because I’m always on HDR at 120hz with the ram set to 7500MT/s (they added a setting in the bios to change it), but I remember getting closer to 7 hours before I did all that, even 8.

  "Old ones okay maybe if decently priced. Problem are new ones, being super overpriced while offering very little. An example : A mid range T14 G5 with a core ultra 5 125U, 60hz 1200p sRGB IPS display, 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage, which for those two are getting below today's standard, is priced at 1200€. Those are specs you'd find on a 600-700€ laptop, not a 1200€ laptop. At 1000€ you can already get something well built with a Ryzen 7 8th gen, 32gb of ram and 1tb of storage (Asus Zenbook, HP Elitebook, etc). In this case that laptop OP showed was a pretty fine deal, but if you took a Thinkpad for the same price you'd have an E14 Gen 6 with even worse specs. They stay good, don't get me wrong : but at any price range there's pretty much always a better deal.",

  "Keyboard's alright. As for the burn in, I think it'll be fine, especially if you don't run max brightness (the screen is very bright, even half brightness is much brighter than most laptop screens) and auto hide taskbar. Bonus point if you use a OLED friendly theme (iirc the O365 suite has one where the background and ui is pure black). Those are only preventive measures and not really 100% necessary unless you're really scared.",
  "Yeah, I think it’ll perfectly suit your use. You can even play games on it like Fortnite at native res with amd adrenaline’s capper on 75 at 70 fps, Minecraft at 100 fps, the 780M is great.",

  "so the intel would be the better choice ? between it doesn't have the multi threading capabilities, that's why i hesitate",
  "The ai 7 350 has a weaker iGPU but is normally slightly better than the 8845hs, would be close or even better since it also consumes less.",
  "Eh, won’t affect much.",
  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

Hi,\n\nI am about to place an order for this laptop and I would like to hear from those of you more in touch with the laptop market if this looks like a good price for the configuration below:\n\nLenovo Ideapad Slim 3 15AHP10\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS\n\nRAM: 16GB DDR5 5600MHz (dual channel)\n\nStorage: 1TB SSD M.2\n\nDisplay: 15.3\" IPS, 1920x1200 (WUXGA)\n\nBacklit keyboard\n\nBattery: 60 Wh\n\nPrice in EUR: €600\n\nI haven't bought a laptop in many years, as I mainly work and play on a desktop, but I wanted something relatively compact to take with me while traveling this summer, maybe even do some remote work away from the heat of the big city, play an occasional game, nothing too demanding (Skyrim-level games, so to speak)..., yet not too small (14\") either, as I work with documents and text and I do need some decent display area.\n\nAre there other good choices in this price range? I wouldn't spend more for a laptop that would only complement my main desktop system and would only be used while away from my home office.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\nUPDATED post to attach pictures of the one I got:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wgc7pxeovfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53e00558e4cfeada5b062bb88af2c658d8afb3a7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zouejseovfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2608043c183416bc91f1b4e53ecb51e4e36b869\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ks70seovfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=441845193ce0c9d6e918fca80c70abd2ac9cc18f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usfu6seovfhf1.jpg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d58cb129c9f2b934621a7f7ab9c32f42c4c888e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddcubseovfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbbffacd3c18d6f7688383fda4b13cdb84dc32e1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpywsyeovfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b33101e74d288e2ad90e7441717aad31d48803b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p759nveovfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0000e4ab1b9a1e366b6dce7c5d9c8c520138bdf8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sqxr2teovfhf1.jpg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd3a4fc9932b78becb0ac618f9b8b535c9240e14\n\n",
  "Trust me, forget about Lenovo Ideapad, the display is horrible. All yellowish and blurred text.",
  "I think for that price you may be able to go up to slim 5 or even pro 5 if youre lucky. Same cpu, try to score more ram too.",
  "TBH I'd recommend Vivobooks over Ideapads 1 or 3 because Lenovo seriously cheaps out on build quality with these, I have a stack of them with dead hinges, one got fried motherboard",
  "Did you end up buying this? I am thinking about buying it myself because its specs at this price feels very value for money. I don't care about gaming myself either. What is your experience so far?",
  "What's the vram of this igpu . Can we increase igpu v ram  from bios",
  "This device is not at all value for money, The Ideapad when overloaded with work tends to slow down and lag, creating a horrific experience for the user and also it starts heating after heavy usage and the battery also drains quickly. The processor is the thing that need to be improved.",
  "I was thinking about buying the similar 24gb variant with 50whr battery for 60k Rs which is nearly €578.I wanted to ask about the display which is 45% Ntsc. Recently bought Ideapad slim 5 gen 10 which is awesome. It has 100% sRGB. So I was wondering how bad is 45%NTSC? And also what games can you play at max experience",
  "im looking buy a laptop mostly for uni, the Ryzen 5, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD version is available for £450, is it worth it?",
  "Hello, im thinking to buy the same one as yours. Could you give me some informations about the battery life and how long it lasts on normal use?",
  "Hey I know it's an older post but how is the laptop holding up so far?",
  "There will be some awesome sales this black friday so watch out for those!",
  "You are right, I had a chance to look at it in person at a local showroom, first of all it is just too dim. At 300 nits it still seems dimmer than my Dell desktop monitor only rated 250 cd/m² / nits.\n\nWhat do you recommend for better display quality? I don't need OLED, just a good decently accurate and colorful IPS.",
  "I avoided a 2-in-1 for the same reason, as I had been reading about the issues with their hinges; are the regular non 2-in-1s just as bad? \n\nI had a chance to see the Slim 3 today in a showroom and it feels kind of flimsy.. the keyboard is nothing like the ThinkPads I owned, it feels soft/rubberized, with a lot of flex.. the keyboard is almost level with the laptop's surface, not enough travel for good feedback.. I'm considering a Thinkpad, even if with a less powerful CPU, but I haven't seen the newer generations, they may just as well not be the same quality as the older ones...",
  "Hi,\n\nYes, I ended up buying it because I could no longer bear all the browsing and comparing and reading reviews... :)\n\nI had used Thinkpads before, and a year ago I had bought the Ideapad 1 for my daughter to use as her first laptop in school, so I was not totally unfamiliar with Lenovo laptops.\n\nWhat can I say, it is kind of what I expected, build quality seems decent, with an aluminium lid, solid plastic/PCB for the rest of the body, and yes, it is very slim, at least compared to what I had been used to. It doesn't look cheap, I got it in Luna Grey, and it's a very nice metallic color, making it look more expensive than it is.\n\nThe display is the regular WUXGA 1920x1200 which for me is perfect in such a compact form factor (it is a 15.3\" display - which I appreciate for portability, while still offering plenty of space for work thanks to its 16:10 ratio). It is \"only\" 300 nits bright, some people complained about it being too dim for them, but I found it perfectly fine, I use it comfortably at 70-75% brightness (my desktop Dell monitor is only 250 nits and it it is still bright enough!)\n\nPerformance-wise it is as expected from a Ryzen 7 8840HS - snappy in all tasks, it won't get hot with regular office work, browsing, watching videos, etc. So far, so good. The fan only starts with some heavy multitasking, such as downloading and installing a large game while also running online tv in the background and working in Office at the same time... but even so, the fan is not loud at all, you can barely hear it.\n\nI've tested it in some games too, again.. it performs as expected, the integrated Radeon 780M is excellent for \"laptop gaming\", it runs games like Syrim, Fallout New Vegas, etc. perfectly smooth in 1080p (or 1200p for that matter). Of course the very slim case is not optimal for cooling, so for extended gaming, even moderate, I would suggest an additional cooler pad/stand. \n\nOtherwise, I'm pretty happy with it, no issues so far.. if I were to be really picky, I'd say the keyboard could be better, it feels a bit soft for my taste, somewhat rubbery. But the backlight is really useful in dark conditions, and I knew I shouldn't expect a \"Thinkpad level keyboard\". I often work on an external monitor, using an external keyboard, so that is not a serious issue for me anyway.\n\nShortly after I bought it, the price was discounted and I could have gotten the 24GB RAM version instead of the 16GB version, for the same price, but I didn't bother trying to return it and order the one with more RAM, I intend to upgrade it to more than 24GB anyway. I intend to add a 32GB DDR5 stick (in addition to the 8GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard) - a total of 40GB should be plenty for the next few years - the added RAM will really be necessary (especially with the integrated GPU), so I would recommend getting the one with more RAM if you don't plan to upgrade it yourself later.\n\n(I would post photos, but I don't think it's possible here.)",
  "The max it can use is 4GB, I don't think you can change that in BIOS (I don't remember seeing any options related to vram allocation). \n\nIn the meantime I upgraded mine to 24GB RAM (8 soldered + a 16GB DDR5 5600MHz stick). Running Task Manager I can see there are always a total of 20GB available for system, thus the rest of 4GB is reserved for the GPU, which is allocated dynamically in games as needed (you can see all those stats live using the in-game overlay provided by the AMD Adrenalin software).",
  "It's not a heavy duty workstation, it's not meant to be \"overloaded\" with work. For regular office work, for students and even for some light-medium gaming it does work well, it doesn't feel sluggish at all. After all, it is an 8 cores, 16 threads, 5.1 GHz boost clock CPU! And the RAM is DDR5 running at 5600MHz! So it's by no means a slow machine, but you really have unrealistic expectations, what does \"value for money\" mean in this case? The performance of a $3,000 laptop in one that costs $600?\n\nThere are two battery versions available for this model, I went for the higher capacity one (60Whr). Coupled with a low TDP of the CPU (only 28W!), the battery really lasts more than many laptops I owned before.",
  "It depends... which Ryzen 5 CPU? The \"U\" versions of the Ryzen 5 CPUs are cheaper (but also slower, such as Ryzen 5 5625U).\n\nAnd what display? The regular IPS lcd, OLED...?\n\nBut £450 seems a bit expensive, for instance I found this configuration online in my country for about £350 (with further 10% off these days):\n\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15ARP10\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 7533HS (up to 4.4GHz)\n\n15.3\" WUXGA, IPS\n\n16GB DDR5\n\n512GB SSD\n\nI'm pretty sure it does the job for uni, office work, etc.\n\n  \nP.S> Oh, and do go for the highest RAM version (I think they come with a maximum of 24GB), it will help a lot for the future, even if all you do is regular work and study, Windows itself and other software are becoming more and more demanding in terms of memory. The price difference is not that much.\n\n#",
  "Hi, mine is the 60 Wh battery (they larger capacity one) and while I haven't used it exclusively on battery yet, from full to empty, it always shows an estimate of 6-7 hours when I unplug it at full charge. It automatically switches to another power plan for better battery life, which you can adjust further manually for even more battery saving, but I guess it also depends on what kind of work you're doing on your laptop while running on battery and the brightness you set for the display. I'd say you can definitely rely on approximately 6 hours of normal office work, browsing, etc. No gaming on battery, obviously.",
  "I only use it occasionally, when I travel or when I spend the weekend away from home and so. No issues so far, it is (obviously) faster than my desktop's i5-9500 / 32GBRAM and I've even played some games, I happy with the performance and the compact size. I've adjusted the display colors to a cooler temperature as the \"built-in\" blue light protection makes the colors slightly too warm by default.",
  "Honestly I really don't know. Everythime it is a surprise when you switch on a new PC. Acer Aspire was good but I have been struggling since the beginning with Touchpad glitches, often it does not work. I think I will give up with PC and buy a Mac At least it lasts forever and no surprises.",
  "Just as bad, the hinges in Ideapads 1 and 3 are painfully weak, also tbh not that many laptops can compare to Thinkpad in terms of reliability. You probably should go with some thinkpad if your budget is limited and under 500$\n\nIf you take T or P Thinkpads, they'll serve you good, new or old ones",
  "Am also in same situation,  I shortlisted this an  Thinkpad with R77735HS",
  "Thanks for taking the time to write this, you really covered everything. I'm also, tired of searching, comparing models and reading reviews... I think I'll buy this one after all, it's also on discount (549€).",
  "Thanks so much for the detailed answer!",
  "i was looking for reviews of this product everywhere, thanks for this. i am also looking at the 24 ram variant.",
  "Hi man thanks for the review.About Display did you find it to have a yellowish tint as many say?!",
  "Hi, the display does show a slightly warm/yellowish tint overall, particularly noticeable with reds - they look somewhat orange, I suspect it's the so called blue light filter built in, but I used the Adrenalin software for the integrated GPU and managed to get reasonably neutral/cooler colors, it now looks similar to my desktop monitor, but if you are a perfectionist, you may need to invest more. But to me, it's not a bad display at all.",
  "Is Ideapad slim 3 15 good I wanna know if I should buy this or not (It need to support at least geshin impact)",
  "Look for models with Ryzen 5 7533HS or Ryzen 7 8840HS at that price point.\n\n\nHere is a review for latter one: https://www.techpowerup.com/review/lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-15ahp10/",
  "A lot of issues with bad build quality. Mine got issue on the hinge / back cover. The repairman said it's still usable, but might lead to a bigger issue in a future",
  "badly built and won’t game well",
  "You should and could find a radeon 760m igpu for that price.",
  "the build quality of this thing sucks. don't buy it",
  "dont buy it",
  "What about Acer Aspire 5 1tera and 32gb of ram",
  "IdeaPad Slim 3 is terrible. The display is awful just for readibility of standard fonts. I returned it after 3 minutes.",
  "Could you explain what those provide over the Ryzen 7 5825U? I’m not being contrarian I’m just unfamiliar, but I bought this laptop last week in a pinch because that’s what was available that day. I have a 2 week return window.\n\nI don’t game or anything, but I do run resource heavy programs for data analytics. Was just trying to keep it under $700",
  "I had a issue with one a couple generations older where the graphics would just stop working this was on Linux then I tried to install a new copy of windows and it didn't register the SSD so I bought a new one which also didn't got recognized. Ended up buying an Asus expertbook.",
  "but its better still then Ideapad 1 laptops?",
  "Forget Apire, I had 5 and 3 and both had problems with display and the trackpad stopped working after 10 months. I trashed them and bought a Mac.",
  "That is somewhat older CPU that uses older iGPU architecture and DDR4 RAM. Both those other CPUs use newer DDR5, have better integrated graphics and are higher powered so they should perform better: https://www.notebookcheck.net/R7-7735H-vs-R7-8840HS-vs-R7-5825U_15086_16413_14092.247596.0.html\n\n\n\nTry searching for 16AHP10, 16ARP10 and 15ARP10 Ideapad models and see if prices fit you.",
  "did you buy Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3? How is it for Data Analytics? 😊",
  "their build quality and quality control kind of same, most of them will have hinge problem after months or a year of using, i have an ideapad 1 (82vg model) 2 years ago and got the hinge broken 3 times, battery fail 1 time, bios fail 2 times and the ssd fail 1 time. my cousin got an ideapad 3 a year ago and she got the hinge broke after 8 months, just buy refurbished business or workstation laptops like lenovo thinkpad, dell precision,... they have better specs and better build quality",
  "Thank you! And that’s a handy site.",
  "I did! It wasn’t awesome honestly. I actually just returned it for a Yoga model and I’m going to test drive it today. But I was also running other resource heavy applications…so it could possibly be fine for analytics tools if you’re not needing to do that at the same time.",

  "Asus ProArt P16 4070 64gb review I've had the ProArt P16 for about a week now and I figured as the information out there is mostly focused on the p13 some people might find this helpful.\n\n(skip ordering if you don't want to see a ramble about what a shit show it was)\n\n**ordering**:  \nMassively lackluster communication in Europe. absolutely no launch day or information regarding the official launch day for any of the ProArt line, just the zenbooks which use the lower clocked AI 300 chips. I got a notification at 1 am on the 27th that they are now available to order for delivery on  the 28th. ordered at 3 am because I happened to be awake, and then the order sat as \"processing\"for over a week. I contact the email support line twice and never heard back, after 5 days, decided to call. first positive part of this is that the phone maybe rang twice and I was immediately talking to a support agent which is very rare in the UK, lovely chap assured me he would follow up on what was holding up the order by the end of the day. never heard back. called again, and again was very promptly talking to a human and he saw the warehouse hadn't answered the first support reps request for an update, and said he would get to the bottom of it, but to wait another 4-5 days til he could guarantee a response. Around 10pm I received an email saying that the order has been \"completed\" and on the order page it gave me a ups tracking number that couldn't be found. At the same time I got an email from the rep I had spoken to earlier in the day confirming that the order had been shipped out and he gave me a different tracking number with a different service which showed it had actually been dispatched that morning before I had called the 2nd time. Overall I'm pretty unimpressed by their entire handling of a product launch for such a premium product, but I'm guessing they just don't care as a more budget focused brand, and they likely don't see the volume on their ProArt line to justify giving more of a toss.\n\nso the shit out of the way, lets get to the product.\n\n**Specs**:  \nCPU: Ryzen AI HX 370 (12 core, 4 p, 8 e)  \nRAM: 64GB LPDDR5 7500  mhz (although I'm getting some strange numbers, sometimes seeing 8400-8500 mhz)  \nGPU: Nvidia 4070 8gb running at PCIe x8 gen 4  \nDisk: 2TB WD SN740 (1.86 usable) (get full speeds, so running on x4 gen 4)  \nDisplay: 4k @ 60hz oled (\\*sad womp noises\\*)\n\n**Form Factor**:  \nGod damn is this thing thin and light. I'm replacing a razor blade 17 and its extremely noticeable at roughly half the weight. Additionally, I've been looking around fro something that can be solely charged with USB C as I'm tired of lugging around several bricks to charge all of my devices, but the power brick supplied is actually remarkably slim and light, making it the first brick I actually wouldn't hate to lug around with me.\n\n**Screen**:  \nbeautiful screen, completely ruined by being possibly the most reflective screen I've ever seen on any monitor. invest in a screen protector with some sort of matte finish because if you run in dark theme, your screen is basically a mirror.\n\n**Touch Pad**:  \nvery nice, only comment is that I have to learn how to hold my hands differently as I frequently move the mouse around and select random bits of text as I type. love the dial, but they really need to work on the palm rejection. Currently I have windows set to disable the trackpad if I have a mouse connected as randomly selecting half the document and overwriting it is annoying.\n\n**Sound**:\n\nspeakers are easily the best I've ever had on a windows laptop and my partner and I really struggled going back and forth comparing it to her 15\" Macbook Air. the air sounds more tinny, but reproduces the balance better at high volumes, where the P16 delivers a much fuller sound, but crowds the vocals at high volume leading to a muddier mix, still I was absolutely blown away by the performance and I had a similar feeling to the first time putting on my HD800s in terms of emotional surprise at the audio fidelity (its obviously not nearly as fine tuned at the HD800's, but with some tuning software, they are extremely good.)\n\n**Fan Noise**:  \nsignificantly louder than most reviewers would have you believe, but it only kicks in if you're playing games at full resolution, max graphics. otherwise its a very slight whisper. even doing several benchmarks didn't even kick on the fans. normal use/ web browsing will be virtually silent. but boy does it take off when gaming.\n\n**Thermals**:  \nnot gaming: you have a laptop.  \ngaming: after 40-50 minutes of pushing the system, upper middle of the keyboard (think the \"6\" key) becomes uncomfortably warm. laptop conveniently converts to \"passive vasectomy\" mode soon after.\n\n**Performance**: (the only thing we really care about)\n\n**Benchmarks**:\n\n**Speedometer**: couldn't get above a 20, quite disappointed with that, but realistically have not noticed even a stutter on anything and I don't necessarily give a lot of stock in a browser based benchmark as there is about a million things that could affect this score.\n\n**Cinebench 2024**:  \nsingle-core: 116  \nmulti-core: 1155  \nGPU: 11038  \nmuch happier with these results, actually beating out each of the systems in my compute cluster which consists of servers running a mix of Threadripper 1950x and Ryzen 5950x, both of which have more cores, all of which are full power cores, which makes the multi-core score even more impressive.\n\n**PassMark**:  \n[https://www.passmark.com/baselines/V11/display.php?id=216744032991](https://www.passmark.com/baselines/V11/display.php?id=216744032991)  \nhonestly kind of surprised the memory score is so low as AFAIK, its absolutely crushing basically any laptop and the vast majority of desktops when you compare the actual benchmark numbers (also intel seems to do almost 2x as well on the same chips over amd, but this is still competing with the top speed intel results, yet still very low overall score)\n\nalso their graphics scores are mega low due to the screen being limited to 60 fps, so tbh this is kinda a crap test.\n\n**Geekbench**:  \n[https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/7300199](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/7300199)  \nagain very nice single and multi-core scores.\n\n**Gaming**:  \nso far its pretty much run everything I have thrown at it with full graphics at native resolution without much complaint. The benefit of the 60 fps limit on the screen means we don't have any high expectation, and it easily handles basically anything up to that 60 fps.\n\n**Battery Life**:  \nlooking at maybe 9:30-10 hours of light use. haven't tested gaming without being hooked up to the wall, because well, whats the point.\n\n**final thoughts**:  \nVery capable machine and I am happy with the sunk cost.  \nAsus could work a little on communication, but the product delivers.  \nthe 60 fps screen has been the only minor gripe, but it looks like the G16 is being released with basically the same specs but a 144hz monitor, so might go with that.  \nAsus for the love of god put an anti-glare coating on your screens.\n\n**most underrated feature: it seems that the sleep mode bug in windows doesn't affect these cpus. in over a week no phantom awakens in the backpack and I even left it off for the weekend and it only lost about 3% battery over 3 days.**",
  "\"looking at maybe 9:30-10 hours of light use.\"\n\nIs the a guestimate, or real-world numbers you have witnessed? because I am only seeing 5-7 hours of web/video on mine unfortunately. \n\n\"Asus for the love of god put an anti-glare coating on your screens.\"\n\nFUCK YES. I look at my reflection more than images on the screen. it's bonkers reflective for a \"Creator\" laptop.\n\nI agree with everything you mentioned in your review. thanks for posting.",

Tried switching to 5g wifi and it happened again. Something must be up with the wifi device in the laptop. Hope its just drivers. Though at first launch I did have to run a large windows update.",
  "Do you visually notice the touchscreen layer, especially on bright backgrounds?\n\nI've had this problem with most high-res touchscreen laptops where the touch layer grid is just super annoying for my eyes (especially when it's that diagonal grid), and yet finding a glass OLED laptop without touch has been challenging.",
  "u/ClassyBukake Thank you for the review of the P16.  It convinced me to pick one up.  I grabbed the RTX 4060 model and so far I'm loving it.

Also, the CPU fan made a cracking noise once, but after a couple gentle hits with one finger on the rear of the laptop, it stopped... should I bring it to an Asus centre to have it checked? I'm a bit worried they'll do more damage than good...",

  "u/ClassyBukake Hi, I am considering buying this laptop for music production and one of the uses I wanted to give it was the recording of vocals in my home studio, and for that the fan noise is very important to me, because if it is too loud it can sneak through the microphone. Could you tell me your experience about the noise? Thank you very much in advance",

  "Hi, if you still own that laptop, could you please help me figure out whether my unit is defective or if this is just a characteristic of all screens in this lineup?\n\n\n\nCould you please check on your laptop: if you first lower the screen brightness to zero using the Flicker-Free Dimming option in MyASUS, and then adjust the brightness through Windows from 45% to 55% - do you see a sudden, noticeable color shift at around 55% (especially towards red, but not only red)?\n\nIt’s particularly visible on colorful images or photos.",
  "Hey, thanks a lot for your review. I’m thinking on getting this model (but the 5070 version as I can’t find the 4070).\n\nI’m a photographer and graphic designer, and I do video editing too. I need to be able to do a few hours of work on the go. Do you think this laptop can deliver that while using the Adobe suite? (I won’t be gaming)\n\nHow is battery life after a year?\n\nFor the past five years I’ve had a Rog Strix with a RTX 2060 which battery can’t handle 2 hours of light use and I want to be sure the laptop I spend my money on delivers on performance and battery life.\n\n(Edit: Thanks in advance, hope you can give me some advice. I need some guidance on what to buy as I don’t have any idea how the market is at the moment)",
  "I took it into work yesterday without the brick, popped it into eco mode and worked about 6:30-7 hours and still had ~35% left when I packed up. Now in this case I was remote desktopping into a dev cluster was literally standing next to, so it was just decoding a 2k video stream using h.264, which Even a 6 watt pico board can do at 60 fps, so very light workload.\n\nI could see if you were doing a lot of heavy multithreaded workloads, it would probably last a lot less, but so far I have yet to reach the point of charger anxiety. Maybe I'll do some more comprehensive testing if anyone actually gives a toss, but my workloads are largely reinforcement learning, coding, and random bits of fuckery, so probably will absolutely shitbrick my battery life stats due to the near constant 100% cpu and GPU utilization.",
  "The right USBC port and hdmi port are assigned to the DGPU.\n\nThe left side USBC port does DP from the IGPU.",
  "It will as long as you're not running games off of it. Then you're almost certainly gonna be drawing more power than it can provide.",
  "It charges just fine on my 100 watt charger, even doing just fine while gaming (if the battery was full at the start of the session) it'll just downclock the system during low periods so that it can make up the difference. Can probably game for 6+ hours without having a significant power drop.\n\nI think the base CPU can draw as low as 20 watts on low power mode, and the entire system will draw something like 130 watts at max load, but rarely if ever is a game 100% all the time.",
  "Build quality is top notch IMO, similar tier as MacBook maybe just slightly lower, definitely in the top tier for windows laptops.",
  "I own a P16 as well, and yea the hinge is pretty wobbly. But I honestly don't notice it at all unless I'm using the touch screen, in which case yea sometimes I do need to keep my hand on the back of the lid for it to not wobble everywhere. Would have hypothetically loved a tighter hinge but in no way is it a dealbreaker haha.",
  "check if the new zephyrus G16 is available. its got 32GB of ram, but its the same system with a 240hz monitor. probably cheaper as well.\n\ntbh, the only times i have gotten even close to using all the ram is when I had fusion, 3ds max, adobe illustrator up at the same time processing a file with about 30m polies in it. and even then 70% of the memory was being taken by a memory leak (I suspect the asus apps are leaking memory every time the system goes into sleep, because each time it wakes up, its slightly slower until the next reboot).",
  "I noticed that too about a month ago. I bought one from Best Buy as an open box item, and it slowed down and blew screened. I returned it because it made me nervous. It started happening out of nowhere after using it for several hours while setting it up. It was such a great machine. I loved the speaker quality, too. It sounded as good as my TVs sound bar. Amazing! The fans were quiet and didn't heat up much at all under regular but not strenuous load. Have you had any more issues with blue screens? I am really hoping it was just a driver issue or just a bad apple since it was an open box item. Best laptop I've ever used otherwise. I just don't know if I want to spend that much without buying a warranty to go with it. Does anyone know where to buy it with a good warranty? I'm not really keen on Best Buy's warranties.",
  "I'm also worried about it. Tomorrow a proart p16 will be sent to me.I will share velevant experience to you.",
  "I managed to find one in a local store... yeah, it's grainy alright. Not as outright horrible as the comparable QHD+ Lenovo or HP touch-enabled OLEDs on display – if you sit far enough you might _just_ be able ignore the touchscreen layer. But you can very much tell that it's a layer and not just a panel imperfection. To me it would be usable enough, but I would not be super happy.\n\n\n\nComparing it side by side with my non-touch 4K OLED Blade – while white background on the Blade has some different kind of graining, it is by far less noticeable or jarring.\n\n\nI found the QHD+ Galaxy Books to have the clearest OLED, maybe even better than my Blade. But, well, they're not 4K, and otherwise not the kind of specs I was looking for.\n\n\nSadly I don't have a camera good enough to try and capture the difference visually.",
  "I don't even have a P16 (thinking about getting one though), but maybe it's a BIOS setting? Have you tried looking in there?",
  "No, it does just fine in all adobe products. I used illustrator and photoshop a little to make a watch face and as part of a 3d print project, but i mostly used it for fusion 360, 3ds max and blender, and if it can handle those, photoshop is relatively light.",
  "It doesnt handle 10bit 4:2:2 footage well at all, but less intensive codecs it does. And if you proxy, you don't have to worry.",
  "It goes up to the limit. I can edit 8k video, play all games etc, do GPU renders, but you cant do more than one at the same time. It's definitely the low limit for serious work, but it does work",
  "That’s fair. But should be said that the boring looks is why I love it. I take it to client meetings and show buildings on it. Definitely don’t game on it. I still think it looks nice but it’s clearly not trying to be a Zephyrus or anything. He’ll even the logo on the Razer blades ruins the professional appeal of those laptops for me.",
  "I would say it's fine, about normal for a laptop. It's not floppy, but it's also not rock steady.",
  "Strange, I've heard no coil whine what so ever from mine. I'm admittedly no longer in my 20's, but my hearing is pretty good.\n\nBesides the sound of the air moving at high fan speeds mine makes no other sounds, and even then it's very quiet if you aren't pushing it insanely hard (been playing a lot of factorization max settings, currently have a world that's been running for 70 hours, and the fans barely spin up running that long term.\n\nIt definitely hasn't spun up and down repeatedly, it's usually pretty passive, ramps up when it needs too and then goes back to silent once the load is off.\n\nHave you messed with the fan curve settings or maybe they were reset when you reset the computer? Mine are stock on \"performance mode\" and had no issues.\n\nMaybe get it checked out?",
  "Do all P16s come with an Ethernet dongle? Trying to see if I didn't leave it somewhere but I don't remember having one",
  "These have mono-color back lights on the keys, so they can only be white.",
  "Directly from asus's website.",
  "What's your software stack, if I can I can try and run while recording and see if it kicks on the fans.\n\nIf the load is low/medium the laptop is completely silent, if it starts hitting the GPU pretty hard, it'll get quite noticeable.\n\nedit: but i cant think of a laptop that isn't completely passive which would be more quiet under normal load. worse case, you can always temporarily force the fans to go into \"silent mode\" and as long as you don't do something crazy, it'll be fine for 5-10 minutes completely passive without kicking on it's \"drone sound generator\" mode.\n\nedit-edit: currently trying to generate a recording with a frequency analyzer sync'd to it so that you can judge for yourself, and it's picking up more sound from the dish washing marchine 2 rooms and walls away than it's getting from the laptop directly next to it, so I think that accurately conveys the amount of sound this makes.",
  "Hey,\nOverall: very happy with it.\n\nIt does cad / photoshop / illustrator / 3ds max / blender without any complaints, even with relatively heavy projects.\n\nSome times it's gotten a little squirally, but 99.9999% of the time it's been a Windows issue.\n\nStill a thin and light system with serious performance and I would say it trades pretty well with a similarly priced Mac book pro, but it can run windows and Linux at the cost of battery life.\n\nAll in all, I give it a solid 8/10 and would highly recommend it or the gaming varients for anyone looking for a laptop.",
  "Yes, I do see this, how strange. I'm guessing this is a bug between my asus and windows as I've never seen this issue as I never changed the MYASUS setting before.\n\nIt looks like the image desaturates.",
  "Thats great to hear!",
  "Just witnessed this with my own P16! Where is this referenced exactly? Projecting on anything HDMI will drain the battery rather quickly (4hrs) - I'll use a DP to HDMI adapter now on the left usb c DP port to use the iGPU - not ideal, not critical either (at least I have options).",
  "can the right usb c port do dp-alt mode?",
  "Sounds awesome! Thank you for reply!",
  "Is it wobble when you type?",
  "Sorry to bug you, but did you end up getting the laptop? What was you experience with it, if so?",
  "It's because it's a touch screen there is a capacitive layer. That's how touchscreens work.",
  "Funny story since I posted my comment.  I returned the laptop feeling that it was a bad system.  I grabbed a MacBook Pro M3 Pro system.  I used it for a week and decided that the 18GB Ram it had was not enough.  Did some research and somehow found something I must have missed a few times.  \"Stay focused with AI-powered ASUS Adaptive Dimming. It adjusts screen brightness based on your presence.\"  It will dim when it thinks you aren't looking at the screen or around it.  I decided to get the laptop again.  Went to the Best Buy that I returned my laptop to and I was able to my system as an open box.......the one I returned previously.  I originally bought it with a $200 off sale and this time the open box was another $200 off.  I got the laptop for just over $1,400 this time.  I found the setting and disabled it and it's been an amazing laptop.\n\nTL:DR\n\nFound the problem with the dimming and also saved $400 of the OG price.",
  "i pulled the trigger and bought the 64GB RAM version. we'll see how it fairs with Unreal Engine, but mostly  it will be my on the go video editor.  I built a very portable mini-ITX rig with an i9-13900k, 96GB RAM, and and RTX4080-(16GB VRAM) that travels in a pelican case (with an 18.4\" travel panel).  It will be a good comparison.  Stay tuned.",
  "Nope, all I did was set the power mode from the ProArt Hub, or MyASUS... but the fans do make a bit of noise when they start spinning or when they stop... and since you have no coil whine nor fan sounds, I'll probably bring it to a near ASUS centre to have it check... thought, it pisses me off quite a bit since how expensive this thing is... but thanks a lot for the answer!",
  "Appreciate it! I purchased it already, thanks to your post and reply!",
  "Thanks! Okay, looks like it’s the same on all units.\n\nI think it might be related to how this display panel behaves when using Flicker-Free Dimming.",
  "I never found a reference, just through trial and error as I had a device that is usbc, but requires an Nvidia dgpu.",
  "Yes",
  "I was worried about it when watching video reviews but in practice I never notice it. In fact I really forgot it was a “problem” until this comment haha 😂 so don’t worry about it in that regard",
  "That's true, but some manufacturers do manage to have much less noticeable capacitive touchscreen layers. It's probably more complicated or expensive to do though, maybe Samsung can only do it because they produce those screens themselves, who knows.",
  "Sweet! I'm really doubting between the ProArt and an MSI Stealth 16 AI Studio. I really like the design of the ProArt and the fact that it has the more efficient AMD chip than the MSI's Intel Core Ultra 9. I can overlook the ProArt having an RTX 4070 instead of the MSI's 4080, but the big dislike for me is the ProArt having a 'glare' screen, and the risk of OLED burn-in. (don't care about the 60Hz).\nIn your opinion, how 'bad' is the ProArt's screen glare, and do you have to take precautions against OLED burn in?",
  "As an aspiring Unreal dev myself, do you happen to have an update on how it performs? Looking into this laptop for similar usage as well.",
  "Ich habe die gleichen Erfahrungen gemacht, aber nur, wenn man ganz genau hinhört. Bei mir ist ein ganz leises Fiepen auf der linken Seite, nur hörbar, wenn man das Ohr nah ran bringt. Links hört es sich auch so an, als ob der Lüfter Intervall mäßig läuft. Hast du das Gerät überprüft?",
  "Thank you, then I guess it's not too bad. I'm considering the 32GB/rtx 4060/1TB variant. BestBuy has a decent deal at $1599",
  "I haven’t found it to be a problem in the P16 personally. I had the previous ProArt and it was much much more noticeable. I was actually surprised to see your comment because it was one of the first things I looked for when I got it and was like “heck yes” when I didn’t notice it. Maybe my older eyes are finally having some benefits as my attention to detail is going away lol",
  "Where my laptop sits does get a lot of sun light reflecting off the screen.  The glare is bad, but I've also owned a few MacBooks and the glare was bad with those too.  I'm a bit used to it.  If glare really bothers you, it might not be the laptop to get.",
  "Coming off an USB 3.2 enclosure, I am able to load up the City Sample small level (probably a decently heavy task).  Load times seem longer than my ITX case but I can navigate around the city just fine.

For $1586 , at best buy for this deal of $500.\n\nIm little worried about seeing the reviews of battery, bios, display, refresh rate, build quality and soo many.\n\nStill thinking how the laptop will be, I need it for a long run.",
  "Ya the glare is a feature for some and a bug for others. For me, I welcome it. There are so few laptops out there with a glossy screen anymore. It’s probably THE thing that persuades me from other Asus laptops that have a touch more power. But if you can’t do it, there’s way more options that don’t have it.",

  "Should I go with Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 or save for something better? Hi! I'm planning to buy a laptop for university, I'm studying software engineering. I’ve looked into several options, and the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 seems like the best choice in that price range. I’m interested in hearing about other people’s experiences with this laptop: how is the battery life, is it fast enough? The screen has an IPS panel, so I don’t think it's too bad in that regard. I need the laptop mainly for studying and everyday tasks, and it's important to me that it lasts for 4–5 years. Do you think this laptop is good enough, or should I consider some slightly better and more expensive options? Thanks in advance!",
  "I wouldn't buy this laptop as it's 2 major generations old. Look for something newer.\n\nCheck what the specifications of the IPS is. If it's 45% ntsc, then it's trash. The colors can be insanely dull.",
  "This laptop likely won't last that long, it's already a ~4 years old model and it's one of the cheaper ones in terms of build quality. \n\nSave for a more mid-range to high-end laptop with a metal chassis, and one that's modern. Getting 4-5 years out of any laptop is pretty hard without REALLY taking care of it.",
  "Which laptop have you purchased?",
  "i bought the snapdragon version hoping for good battery + speed. instead, what i got - overheating, lag under normal workloads, snapdragon throttling under load, battery dying way faster than promised.",
  "The Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 feels basic and underwhelming. Its plastic build rattles, and the fan noise is annoying even on battery. The screen is okay but nothing special, and the outdated Intel processor struggles with multitasking and gaming. Slow Wi-Fi and limited ports only add to the frustration. For the price, it feels like too many compromises were made, making it a tough recommendation. If you want a budget laptop, there are better options out there that don’t feel this sluggish or cheap. Definitely not a laptop I’d want to rely on daily.",
  "Yes, the screen is 45% NTSC, but I don’t pay too much attention to that because of my limited budget. What matters more to me is that it has good memory and a good processor. The other laptops I’ve looked at in this price range have TN screens, which are much worse.",

  "Ok so come back I just found a better version of the Lenovo with 32gb of Ram and 1tb storage so now I really don’t know",
  "I’ve heard people say the Unix terminal is better but hardware wise the Lenovo is giving me 32gb ram and 1tb ssd which is double the M4’s (16/512)  and the Lenovo costs less so now I’m really f’ing confused",
  "Okay I'm a CS grad as well, with industry and research experience so let me give you my opinion on this. \n\nThe nix shell or the posix shell is better yes and you'll be better suited with it, but considering budget and pragmatism,  you can also use windows subsystem for linux or wsl. So right now, the main deciding factor for you should be which os you're more comfortable with? Hardware specs are one thing but if you have to sacrifice years of workflow and familiarity it's not worth switching. So if you're on Windows now, stay on Windows. If you've been on macOS, stay on macOS. \n\nAnd obviously cost is a no brainer. If you want more bang for the buck and the Windows machine does your job, why not? \n\nP.S. - 32 GB should make it a breeze to run WSL as the underlying VM takes up about 4GB and you can shut it down when you don't need it. (Automatically shuts down after a while of inactivity)",
  "Thanks for the advice but I think I’ll switch to MacOS because I used my brother’s MB Air a few times and it was the best laptop experience I had and I think I also want to explore other options apart from Windows. I’ll only be using it for 4 years then after graduation I’ll return home where I can build a desktop with better specs!",

HS is 15% better in performance than U.\n* **7735U** has better performance per watt, meaning slightly higher battery power than 7735HS. U has better efficency than HS (maybe like 10mins more depending on the usage).\n\nMake sure you are getting the model that you are looking for.

  "Alternatives to power button on Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Pro 16ARH7 A few years ago, I bought the laptop mentioned in the title. It served me very well until the hinge broke and squished part of the screen. \n\nI now have a new laptop, but luckily my dad can use the laptop since he already uses an old laptop connected to some external displays. \n\nThe only issue is that ideally he would like to keep the lid closed and control it using the external peripherals but the power button is on the inside.

  "Which laptop to buy after the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 14ARE05 (ideapad) ? Hello !  \n5 years ago I bought a Yoga Slim 7-14ARE05 Laptop (ideapad) - Type 82A2 and it has been a blast. It has perfectly fullfilled what I was expecting it to do which is :  \n\\- coding (low level programming like kernel stuff and a bit of AI running)  \n\\- movies/series  \n\\- small gaming on not so demanding games like World Of Tanks or League of Legends\n\nPlus I thought it looked really cool with the metal case.\n\nHowever I am now looking to buy a new one and can't manage to find another one that fits as well as it did, eventhough it was 5 years ago. I went through the Lenovo store and didn't manage to see something that looked to be as good, but maybe I overlooked something.  \nI'm not sure to want a Macbook either since I got comfortable on PCs (and need a decent amount of storage)  \nMy price range can go at maximum to 1200.\n\nWould anyone have any recommandations ?",

  "Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3i- Core i7-13620H I didn't see much reviews of it(especially the i7 version),so thought I'll just a leave a review.(I've been using it for 14 days). I got the 16/512 variant for around 2500 SAR (670 USD,around 56000 INR, although it was at 63-65 when I checked Flipkart), although might be a different price in some other country.\n\nBuild Quality - A sturdy plastic build,but I felt kinda unimpressed with it (probably cause I came from a Huawei Matebook,which had a all metal build),but nevertheless for this price I'm not complaining much\n\nScreen- The anti glare coating is really helpful,and it does remove a lot of the glare on screen,and what else it's your regular IPS 1080p LCD panel. Pretty average,60 Hz,but it gets the work done.\n\nKeyboard - It comes with a full size keyboard ( with a number pad),and for me,keys felt a bit congested,I was just constantly pressing the wrong key( or I might have just big hands lol),but once you get around that the keyboard feels really solid.\n\nPerformance- Fantastic performance, for office works ,notes, school or college stuff,(I wrote some exams in this too), integrated graphics so not much gaming possible ,but I did get around 180 fps in valorant, although I mostly limit it to 65 fps to be easy on the CPU and so it doesn't overheat. You should be able to do some light gaming with no problems.\n\nBattery - I mostly have my charger around so I don't have much concern about the battery. For an H series CPU I'm not complaining about battery. When I do just basic tasks ,I always set it to battery saver ,and it does last me around 6-6.5 hrs\n\nSome Nice to haves- This one came with a fingerprint reader, feels pretty snappy.",

I’ll use it for my school, programming (lots of multitasking) and light gaming ( Roblox only)\n\n I honestly don’t know much about laptops, but the fan shouldn’t be too loud, right? I saw a comment saying the fan runs loud—do you think it’s really noisy, or only when gaming? \nThe model btw is slim 3i 15irh8, tho there is another model which is slim 3 15irh8 with same specs but higher price, which idk what the difference is..",

The trackpad sometimes ghosts a bit( i.e it feels like the cursor is catching up to you, rather than moving instantly),but it only lasts for like a min. and also I mostly use an external mouse ,so personally i didn't feel it to be much of an issue.\n\n2. The laptop crashes rarely when I play valorant on it, although i think its more of a vanguard anti cheat problem rather than the device problem.\n\nBesides these problems, so far this laptop is holding up well.\n\nIs it the best in this price range? Depends on your needs. You could get laptops with a better display, but the CPU mostly will be from the Intel or Ryzen U series, or you can get a Matebook which has an all metal premium build, but it comes with the core i5 rather than core i7.",

I know almost nothing about laptops.\n\nCurrently in medical school and my primary concern is being able to run large dataset computations and R for research, battery life for school/hospital in the future, Remote Desktop apps and being able to keep a lot of tabs open. \n\nI have previously used an hp pavilion for almost 8 years but struggled with the slow processing and battery life.\n\nIdeally, I’d like the laptop to last for the next 10+ years. \nOf note: I own an iPad and iPhone as well\n\nThank you for your help!!",
  "There is no debate. The Mac M4 wins by a wide margin. Highly recommend going with Air, imho the MacBook Pro is way overkill. If you do need to use Epic or some other EMR that just works better on Windows, get a second cheap thin average Windows machine to run those apps and keep things portable for you. An older Surface laptop may be a good bet for this usage.",
  "If looking at 10+ years ownership and already using apple products then macbook M4 definitely.",
  "Shitty tablet + shitty laptop 2 in 1. Wins till the first drop",
  "If the Mac ecosystem is familiar to you and conducive to getting your daily tasks done, then go for the Mac. I would strongly advise against Lenovo's 2-in-1s. I do computer repairs and these fail miserably in the hinge area. The brackets separate from the LCD cover which can ultimately lead to the display panel being damaged if not addressed quickly. Up to last week a customer contacted me to have one repaired. If Windows is more conducive then go with one of the business line machines like a Thinkpad.",
  "Is Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15IRH10 (83K100FKPB) a good laptop? I've been looking for a laptop that's suitable mostly for programming and light-gaming (I occasionally do other stuff like light video or photo editing as a hobby, also planning on becoming an fl studio stan in the future). Quick note: although I've been in the PC sphere for quite some time, I'm still not really knowledgeable on most of this stuff (I found out about CPU generations only a week or two ago). I mostly want a laptop that has reasonable price and good enough specs that don't eat up much of the battery (which is why I kinda avoided discrete GPUs and high Gz models, especially considering that this stuff is kinda out of my field in general)\n\nIn general this laptop's specs seem good enough for me, but the fact that there's barely any reviews on it as of now somewhat worries me. I'm not dead-set on buying this specific one, but so far it's been the only one that actually has satisfying flavour, at least in theory. If there's anyone who's already bought the laptop and's been using it for some time already, is it good or should I look for different options?",
  "For lenovo I insist on Think series machines. I was given a free IdeaPad years back and despite being fairly new it was like trash.",
  "Lenovo ideapad slim 5 trackpad not working and warrrenty issue,  Please read and help me i bought a new lenovo ideapad slim 5 on oct 26th, When i received it the warrenty was overed i asked the shop whether whats the issue , he said smt and told within 2 weeks will update the warrenty issue but till now i didnt get the warrenty , now the trackpad is not working like sometimes i need to hard press and drag the trackpad then it start workin, rn it's totally not working, i asked him regarding the warrenty issue he isnt replying back . rn im not in my home place where i bought it, im away for my college and cant go back,  i bought it in a 3rd party electronics showroom called CROMA i have my invoice of purchase and all , So guys please if anyone knows what to do or how to get a refund of my money will it get refunded ? , please guide me i cant even tell this issue to my family since they will get pretty upset that a laptop of tis price isnt working",
  "MacBook Air M4 vs. Lenovo Slim 5 I'm an Economics student prioritizing **best overall user experience and long-term reliability**.\n\nMy usage is light: Office, web, Zoom, and light gaming.\n\nBoth laptops are the **exact same price.**\n\nThe Options\n\n* **MacBook Air** 13\" M4 (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n* **Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5** 13\" (Ryzen 7 7735HS, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nWhich would you recommend for the best all-around student machine?",
  "I would say that the MacBook Air would last long by a long shot. Aside from its great quality build, Apple has a great track record of supporting their hardware for many many years. It’s a bonus if you happen to own and iPhone since there’s so much seamless integration and synergy going on.\n\nThat said, the one thing that gives me pause - and this might age me - is to consider if there’s any software that your courses may use that are Windows-only since Windows is the most dominant operating system out there. It’s rare to see it these days but I would still look into it. Especially since emulating Windows on MacBooks will cost an additional amount using off the shelf solutions like Parallels, or some research on how to run WINE depending on your level of comfort.",

  "Macbook Air M2 vs Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5/5x Snapdragon X Plus Macbook Air M2 - 16GB/256GB\n\nLenovo - 32GB/1TB\n\nBetter buy? Primarily as a school/work laptop. Will be using mainly for office apps (MS Word/Google Docs, PPTs, excel/spreadsheet, Canva) and for thesis presentation. General media consumption as well. \n\nWill only do light gaming like minecraft and balatro as I already have a Desktop PC for other heavier stuff.\n\nMainly looking for something with a good screen, good battery life and portability.\n\nPrice is close to each other with the MBA M2 just slightly cheaper\n\nI also don't own other apple products so I am not tied in to any eco system.\n\nMacbook - 45k PHP\n\nLenovo - 49k PHP",

  "Buying Lenovo Ideapad slim 5 gen 10 Hi, i need to buy a laptop and after several research I am almost convinced to buy the Lenovo Ideapad slim 5 gen 10 with this configuration: -15 inch -512 GB of memory -16 GB of RAM -AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS -70 Wh battery -OLED 165 Hz display do you guys think is a good purchase? is there something I am not considering? have some tips?",
  "Thoughts on Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS 13.3 inch (33.7cm) WUXGA IPS Laptop (16GB RAM/512GB SSD I saw good reviews for its higher model (AMD Ryzen 7 AI) but it was much costlier at around Rs. 80k. Saw this version at amazon and the spec looks good and at under 60k, it feels like a good buy considering I have only office use+ video streaming. Bt there are less reviews available so is it actually good on use?",
  "Is this a good deal? Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 This is my local Costco's price for the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 16\". As far as I can tell, it's $200 cheaper than Lenovo's website and the model's not available on Best Buy or Amazon.\n\nI'd be using it primarily for school.\n\nIs this a good deal, or should I hold out for a sale? \n\nThanks!",
  "That battery life doesn't look good, To be honest.",
  "Or go to Best Buy to look at the open box ones. And make sure that you speak to someone who knows about computers.",
  "Lenovo Ideapad slim 3 gen 10 AMD 14\" So i bought this laptop for £469 in the UK for university and i have had it for about a week now and I have not seen any reviews so i thought i would leave a review. It has a ryzen 5 8640hs with integrated radeon graphics, 16gb ram dual channel and a 60wh battery\n\nBuild quality: This laptop is made of sturdy plastic, the finish feels very nice but it is nothing to boast about, it is good enough for the price. I like how it is very lightweight and is really easy to carry around.\n\nDisplay: The anti-glare coating is great for this and really helps when it is sunny outside and the sun is very bright. 1920x1200 is very sharp but other than that its a regular 60hz IPS panel but it definitely gets the job done.\n\nKeyboard: This one does not come with a full size keyboard but I am not too bothered by this personally as I dont usually use the rest of the other keys. Sometimes I do press the wrong keys but once you get used to it, its a solid keyboard.\n\nPerformance: The CPU in this is very fast, whatever I do happens in an instant whether im video editing, watching videos, playing games or in a meeting. The 16gb ram also plays a huge role in this. What surprised me the most was the performance of the GPU considering its only 15W. I dont play very heavy games but this GPU was able to run forza horizon 4, fortnite, GTA, battlefield 1 and hollow Knight at good fps(these are the games I usually play). I also did some wii u emulation and it was flawless. One thing I will mention is that the laptop can be quite noisy when gaming on extreme performance mode but is very quiet when not being pushed.\n\nBattery: The battery on this is great for what it is. I was able to achieve around 7-8 hours from 100 percent to 20 whilst just doing my assignments(on battery saver). I got around 5-6 hours on netflix. When gaming the max i got was around 3 hours of battery life which is not too bad.",
  "wow thanks for this review! I was thinking of getting this laptops but couldn't find a lot of reviews so thanks <3",
  "Nice review, I just bought the version with AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS with dual RAM of 8 GB each. I hope I don't regret it, but the price of €630 seemed very advantageous to me honestly",
  "How good an idea is it to get this same version but with 24GB of RAM for $800? Considering that I live in Chile and our prices tend to be higher than those in first-world countries.",
  "Hi! Thanks for the review. Do you think it's worth getting the Ryzen 78840HS version for 40€ more?? I'm gonna be using it for university work. Music production software and other music related software and some gaming",
  "Hi, I am interested of this Laptop, i.e. the 8840HS variant, supports DP alt mode 1.4 on the USB-C port.",
  "I know it's an old post but how is the laptop holding up so far ?",
  "Hi I’ve had this laptop for over a month now and it’s been pretty good thus far but have a few issues/concerns and wanted to see if others are having! 1. The trackpad is not good my fingers dont move on it well and it doesn’t feel sturdy it feels pretty cheap. 2. I might of banged it at some stage but I noticed with the display when it shows black things the pixels are blue in a certain spot only a little you can barely notice it but it bothers me.",
  "No problem its a great laptop for its price, still going strong right now",
  "How is the battery?",
  "As far as I'm aware the \"24GB\" version doesn't exist, it can just support up to 24GB, as in you need to buy extra memory and install it yourself. If that's 800USD that's a disgusting price. Are Apple products also more expensive there? Personally I'd be looking into an Air M4 for that price.",
  "Dont get it, its not worth it at that price point",
  "Absolutely, that ryzen 7 is quite a bit faster and will be better for running multiple tasks, the igpu on it is slightly faster than the ryzen 5 one by about 10%. For €40 more yeah i would say its worth it",
  "Cant really say but its most likely similar to this one but with a stronger gpu and cpu",
  "Its holding up great the battery and performance is still good",
  "In reality it has yet to arrive, they're taking a long time to ship and maybe I'm changing my mind, opting for a thinkpad for €100 more though",
  "Hi, this I assume. Does your model support DP Alt Mode 1.4?",
  "I can buy the slim 3, witht he ryzen 7 only 16gb ram and 60Wh battery for £466, worth ?",
  "ciao, potresti fare un aggiornamento? quale PC hai preso alla fine? a che thinkpad stavi pensando? ti trovi bene?",
  "Whats that",
  "Yeah thats worth it",

  "Yoga Slim 7 or IdeaPad Slim 5? I'm planning to use this mainly for work and it involves heavy and huge Excel datasets so the 32gb memory is a must or so I've heard. I also want a portable laptop hence these sizes. Anyone that has used any of these, are they good for long term? Also, if there are any suggestions for other laptops fitting my requirements, feel free to suggest some.",
  "If you want something that will last longer and feel more solid, the Yoga Slim 7 is the better pick. It’s built with more premium materials and usually holds up better over time.For performance, Slim 7 also tends to be faster and smoother, especially if you multitask a lot.The IdeaPad 5 is still good if you’re on a budget, but it’s more of a value laptop, so it won’t feel as strong or powerful in the long run.Slim 7 = better build + better performance. IdeaPad 5 = cheaper, good enough for everyday stuff.",
  "Thanks for the insight! Also, if you would know, is an Intel Core processor better or AMD?",
  "It really depends on what you want. Intel usually has better efficiency and single-core performance (good for battery life and everyday stuff). AMD often gives you more cores/threads for the price, so it’s better value if you do heavier multitasking or want stronger integrated graphics.",
  "Got it! So the Slim 7i Aura Edition is still a good pick? Thank you so much again.",
  "Need a laptop for work! Deciding between Acer Aspire 5, Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 and Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge I work mostly from home and I have an iMac which I use 90% of the time. I had an iMac air (from 2016) which I took to meetings, did presentations with and worked on whenever I wasn’t at my desk. My laptop recently died and I want to replace it. I don’t have the budget to replace it with another iMac laptop, so I’m looking at different options. I need it to use Microsoft Office, Teams calls, OneDrive, downloading and uploading videos, occasional photo or video editing (I do most of this on my desktop compute but it would be nice to have a backup), presentations, AirTable. ChatGPT recommends Acer Aspire 5 for the price, but in worried it would be too bulky for me. Since I use it on the go I would prefer something more portable. I found these around the same price range. Any insight or feedback? The price in the images are in Canadian dollars.",
  "i know you don’t want the acer, but its the best out of all. even though its bulky, its the most powerful. so, i advise the acer.",
  "The Snapdragon is actually the best option here assuming you don't use anything that doesn't run on ARM. \n\nIt really depends on what you're doing.\n\nThe Snapdragon won't run video games super well, so really depends on your use case. \n\nI would need to look at benchmarks to know the difference between the Intel and the AMD in this case, but I generally lean towards ryzen.",
  "Do not buy any Snapdragon laptops. They do not support software. So avoid the Samsung.\n\nThe Lenovo has a little old CPU. It's definitely not worth 650.\n\nThe Acer is the best option here. You get a powerful CPU, and RAM is a minimum amount for the laptop to run well as multitask.",
  "If you need it for work, forget these 3 and look for a used Lenovo Thinkpad T-series for this price.",
  "Big fan of the Aspire. I got a cheaper model and upgraded to 16 gb ram and it runs as well as my work MacBook pro for everyday tasks.",
