  "swift go 14 sfg14-72-53bp (125H, OLED) UPDATE: 4 months later. i love love love it. it's perfect for me. a 14\" MBP that can do everything that i could ever imagine. no problems thus far. :fingers\\_crossed:\n\n[https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72-53bp](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72-53bp)\n\ni was writing a comment on [Im planning on getting the Acer Swift Go 14 with the oled screen... is this a good idea? : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1dh9jne/im_planning_on_getting_the_acer_swift_go_14_with/) and basically ended up writing a review, so:\n\nI just got the 125H version (mis-posted as 135H) off eBay for $550 \"like new\"/\"open box\". It's incredible, especially when coming from a limiting chromebook and an even more limiting iPad mini, lol! The 125H goes for $850 and the 155H goes for $1000 on the Acer US store.\n\nof note: the older [Acer Swift X 13500H RTX 3050 version](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-x-14-laptop-sfx14-71g-5911) (an older *non-touch* IPS screen) is going for $800 new! That's a significantly better gpu, but likely more power-hungry and perhaps limited by the 65w battery and even 100w charger, but who knows: those AMD ryzens seem to do way better than the intels of their time. Highly likely to find one going for a low price compared to bigger names. The next jump is at $1300 for a new swift go 14\" 155H rtx 4050.\n\nhere's a quick useful video review about it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3I3q48674&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3I3q48674&t=180s)\n\nmajor notes:\n\n* **the version with the OLED screen does not have touch input.** I found this out the hard way. :( I guess i assumed that the swift's \"go\" series was like \"flipbook\" and \"spin\", in that the touch-screen is it's main feature, without the flipping/spinning part. I was wrong. (the 155H version has touch-screen: [SFG14-72T-71QF](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72t-71qf) along with a 16\" version. Look for the icon with a finger pointing.)\n\nmajor cons:\n\n* the battery life is lower compared to other ultrabooks, maybe 6-10 hours vs 10-14 hours zenbook, perhaps due to the 65w vs 75w battery(?). I can't say yet, and maybe windows (and it's bloatware) is still doing something, but i got 10 hours on my first three charges, draining at \\~10%/hour; But i also always use minimum brightness, and just had the normal 30 tabs open (edge, most tabs sleeping) with music playing. Conversely, perhaps because it has a smaller battery, it charges very very quickly: an hour or so (with the given charger). It's also nice that usb-c was standardized for charging, though i wished the usb-c cable would detach from the power block... A minor gripe. After the first few drains, i've kept the laptop charged, and used some pre-installed Acer program to limit charging when plugged-in (to 80%, no choice). This really is it's only major con.\n* the OLED is glossy. so glossy you can see a deep, deep, and rich reflection of yourself. It's like looking into a dark mass of water. It raises self-awareness and horror :cold\\_face:\n\nproblems likely similar to other ultrabooks, and other notes:\n\n* fan noise, and heat. when it speeds up, it's clearly audible in a quiet bedroom when it starts up. it can start with very little computering ([the zenbook got panned in a review for being worse](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Zenbook-14-OLED-review-The-1-2-kg-subnotebook-with-120-Hz-OLED-and-Core-Ultra-7.805236.0.html)), then it goes back to silent mode, and thankfully, *stays* silent. And when it's silent, it's *absolutely* silent! It's apparently not louder than it's competitors tho?? sounds fine to me... *Thank goodness!* Along with fan noise, it can get a little warm at the palms. I think this happened during the beginning of it charging. Thankfully, the aluminum(?) case ensures it cools down quickly, and keeps it cool. (this is my portable-desktop-laptop, wherein i plan to use a separate mechanical keyboard most of the time anyway). However, when it's not charging, it seems to stay quiet 'n cool, which is the most important time.\n* the speakers are bass-less, but the amp is surprisingly incredible(!!).. but then again, i've never heard good laptop speakers in my life. Zero bass, which i'm okay with, as i'm a dreamy-pop treble music person, but just say no to lo-fi/city-pop. It's interesting to hear bass guitars without the bass.. It reminds me of my old purple 'n gold ATH-AD700 headphones that i adore, but far worse mixing. The audio goes through some artificial spatial surround sound software: the mids seem to live recessed in the bottom center of the laptop (vocals), then are overtly forwarded to every direction / speaker in the artificial speaker system (piano), the highs are all over the place, moving from one part of the laptop to another; and the lows remind me of bad midi music. Your favorite music will *not* move you. You will however listen to your favorite music in a very different way.. Having said that, the speakers can get very loud, easily able to fill up a room(!!), and most importantly: beyerdynamic 300r 32ohm headphones sound great at a mere 10% volume!\n* the up and down arrow keys share a single key area. I use wasd for gaming, so it doesn't bother me. This also keeps the keyboard's shape to a neat rectangle.\n* the left modifier keys aren't big. they're the same size as the letter 'n number keys. The right modifier keys, however, are slightly wider. They had to do this to make space for the function key. UPDATE: i re-mapped/swapped left-control with left-alt, mac-style. much better. i'll likely re-map holding caps-lock to left-control too.\n* the keys feel only slightly better than my $40 samsung chromebook 4, which, now that i'm looking at it, surprisingly, has the big fat left modifier keys and complete arrow keys too! Not bad, that thing! (for programmers the tilde key and delete keys are nice to have, and nicely placed, as are the half-size function/special keys... tho, i'm scared of what bloatware the acer key will manifest..!) UPDATE: in retrospect, it's actually a great keyboard. I ordered a keychron k6, and those red keys are god awful. Seriously, who want's to press a key down for a one-half inch?? I've become used to the tiny distance of laptop keyboards..\n* the 14\" screen is a huge surprise coming from an 11.6\" chromebook (2.4\" is a lot!) and even the 13.3\" macbook, yet it's dimensions are only very slightly larger (<1\"). There's about an inch of empty space on both sides of the keyboard--I'm the sort of person who saw the 15\" Macbook and thought, *\"ugh, what is all that space for!?\"*, and didn't buy one until the 13\" came out. The massive OLED screen gets as close as you'd want to the edges--any closer, your fingerprints would smudge the beautiful screen when opening/closing it. As does the massive trackpad.\n* the bigger touchpad may cause more accidents. I haven't had enough experience, but thus far, it seems fine for my hands, for the most part. I did have had it click on random parts of this review i'm writing quite a few times.. but then again, i'm currently sitting at a bad angle. UPDATE: i love it. bigger is better. i must have gotten used to it, as i don't accidentally touch it anymore..\n* the ports are perfect for me, as i'm not updated on current technology: two thunderbolt(?, new to me), two usb--one on each side!!!, one hmdi, a headphone jack, an sd card reader, and a good ol' kensington lock, lol. I've never used a lock before, but have always found it intriguing . I feel the port choices are very old-school, like me. :) It might be possible for 4 displays for this chip...!? (note: smaller 13.3\" laptops can compromise on ports)\n* bloatware. after 20 years, this still exists. Why? McAfee still exists..?? I did however use the 1 year of 100GB dropbox. Could someone please ship me a usb flash drive or sd card so that i can re-install windows? ;(\n\nwith all the similar \"ultrabooks\" (Asus zenbook, Lenovo yoga, HP spectre, Dell xps 14, maybe even the lower-end Acer spin, Asus flipbook, Asus vivobook, HP pavilion plus, Dell inspiron plus, 'n so on), i felt it's pretty hard to decide on one, and just went with what good deals i found on eBay, and checked the review on notebookcheck, and double-checked that the specs are indeed \"ultra\" (weight, size, build quality--not plastic).\n\nit's direct local (to Taiwan) competition is the asus zenbook, and i actually think that's a better notebook. Better speakers, better keyboard (i prefer big keys over the macbook chiclet-style), betters looks (premium business ultrabook vs macbook clone), lighter (an insane 1.3kg), and most importantly a better battery (75w vs 65w, 12+ hours vs 8 in tests!), but, notebookcheck's review noted a fan noise problem, due to it having a single fan / heat-sink vs this Acer's double fan 'n heat-sink. The problem could just be a fluke, but def worth researching other users experiences about it. Beyond that single problem though, i def prefer the zenbook. However, if a macbook clone is what you're really into, this Acer is just that!: a 14\" Macbook Pro (possibly for half the price due to bad resale value)\n\ni personally chose the Intel ultra series for it's great games/power balance, and x64 architecture. I missed out on the entire AMD marathon. An older asus rog flow x13 (g14 doesn't have touch-screen), razer blade 14, or microsoft surface pro (intel ultra series, not the newer ARM arch models) would have been my top choices, if i were to accept something more used. The previous gen surfaces were way too expensive! But i'm super stoked with what i got for $550. Wow! Also, i love Taiwan (made in Taiwan <3), so Acer 'n Asus were actually my top choices (they do all the hard work of making everything, and are absolutely lovely people with an incredible culture to behold, so let them have all my monies!). Actually, i've been fond of the swift series laptops, particularly swift 3 series and 5 series, ever since that time i went to a physical store to test 'n compare laptops. They were by far the best deals in the \"budget\" range. They were all ultrabooks in my eyes, for a fraction of the price of one.\n\nthe OLED is stunning. Now there's absolutely no need for a Macbook for me. My last one was a late-201313\" MBP. Hello again, Windows. How i've missed you dearly. And oh my, how you've accepted Linux..?? I don't even need Linux anymore, and that's coming from Arch! Also, having done some programming, i can't justify the sufferings that Apple has made programmers go through over its reign. Microsoft has since made a big turn towards accepting open-source, linux, programmers, etc. Strange, but good... i hope.\n\nfor my personal needs, the lower-resolution IPS touch-screen would've been ideal, for both touch input and possibly better gaming performance (*does native resolution matter nowadays..?*). It is indeed a major bummer. However, i feel that without the the ability to swivel the screen around (\"convertible\"), it would've made an odd touch-screen experience anyway, quite different from tablets. Also very important to note, **there's quite a few touch-screen OLED notebooks--**[**including the zenbook**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/13wdvxm/oled_touchscreen_is_awful/)**--, that suffer from a grainy screen problem**--though, i don't know which exact models / year have this problem. So, in the end, i feel it was more of a blessing. Anyway, i'm hoping my next job will pay for a premium laptop. At the moment, if money were not a factor, i'd go for either the Asus rog flow x13 or dreamy z13. The z13 is all i've ever dreamed for, ever since the iPad came out. ;) ...but i've read that even the z13 suffers from a very low battery life. :/\n\nUPDATE: now that i've got OLED, i can't imagine ever going back.. o.o\n\nso, if i were to choose again, a \"new\" 2022 asus rog flow x13 ryzen 7940HS would have been my choice, and very very surprisingly, it's going for a mere \\~$800!! So, unless you find a deal like mine, you should just go for one of the best out there! Otherwise, this is an incredibly solid laptop for its price. It has also easily convinced me macbooks aren't worth it anymore, as it was a decade ago, even considering the newer ARM M-series. I'm a believer of Acer/Asus/Taiwan!",
  "Is the fan noise not that big of a deal? I plan to buy this same model, and will be using this inside my university's computer laboratory. And I don't want to distract others with the fan noise.",
  "I bought my Acer Swift Go 14 on September 28, featuring an Ultra 5 125H processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and a 90Hz OLED HDR display running Windows 11 (23H2). I got it for 60,000 INR after discounts, down from around 80K. My previous laptop was the ASUS FX504, which I used for 6 years.\n\n# Negatives:\n\n* Wi-Fi Speeds & Performance: The ASUS consistently outperforms the Acer in download speeds, and I occasionally feel a static sensation when touching the metal surface while charging.\n* Sharp Trackpad Edge & Heat During Charging: The trackpad edge is uncomfortable, and the right side gets hot while charging, making it tough to use on my lap.\n* Useless Copilot Key & Keyboard Backlight: I remapped the Copilot key to Ctrl using AutoHotKey, but the keyboard backlight turns off too quickly, which is frustrating.\n* AI Features & Webcam: The AI eye contact feature is poorly executed, and the wide-angle webcam captures too much of my surroundings.\n* Glossy Display: It's highly reflective, which isn't ideal for bright environments.\n\n# Positives:\n\n* Stunning Design & Trackpad: The laptop looks sleek, almost like a MacBook, and the massive trackpad is so good that I hardly use a mouse.\n* Solid Hinge & Great Keyboard: The hinge is easy to open with one hand and feels premium, while the keyboard is clicky and visually appealing.\n* Outstanding Display: It's bright and colorful, with excellent HDR for movies.\n* Useful AI Features & Decent Speakers: The AI background blurring and noise cancellation work well, and the speakers are good for a laptop.\n* Convenient Charging & Good I/O: I can use my phone's USB-C charger, and there are multiple USB ports and useful features.\n\n# Performance:\n\nWhile I haven't tested it with games or benchmarks yet, the Acer is significantly faster than my ASUS for everyday tasks. It handles multiple apps smoothly, even on battery.\n\n# Battery Life:\n\nYou can't expect stellar battery life with a high-resolution H-series processor. I got around 5 hours of SOT with regular use and 4 hours while looping a 4K movie. There are ways to extend battery life, but I prefer using it to its full potential since it stays on my desk most of the time.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nFor the price I paid, I believe I found the best laptop for my needs. I'm very satisfied overall. **For the full review, check out my post** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcerOfficial/comments/1g75rhv/new_acer_swift_go_14_ai_pcs_review/).

Oh also, if you actually need to use windows, i’m not sure if windows even runs on ARM..?? (see link). And what about all those games/apps made for x64 or even older 32-bit? You’d have to research into Mac’s emulation. I would hope the x64 emulation is good, as it takes time to transition cpu architectures.. I personally just wouldn’t want to bother with all of this, so it better be dang good! The intel Macs was a good time imo, having Mac and windows run natively via boot camp. ARM, i have no idea.

Forcing people to buy a Mac product just to deploy to it is insane to me (though surely there’s a service for that now..). Adding restrictions such as which programming language you can use (no JIT, meanwhile Android runs on JVM..). I’ll take the messes that are windows and android/linux any-day.

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",

  "Choosing between Regular Laptop and Laptop with dedicated GPU - Is the fan noise too much for a classroom? I'm a student looking for a laptop under in the budget range $500-900 for coding, classes and everyday use. I don't play games, but an NVIDIA GPU would help me with CUDA programming. Currently, I rely on my university's cluster, which makes debugging a bit cumbersome. \n\nI had initially chosen the [Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-500/ideapad-pro-5i-gen-8-16-inch-intel/83aq000qus) since it fits my budget and doesn't look like a bulky gaming laptop. \n\nHowever, I've come across many comments and reviews that any laptop with a dedicated GPU can be noisy, have poor battery life, get too hot to touch, and so on. \n\nI hope you guys could answer these questions:\n\n* Do these issues still apply even if I'm not using the GPU and have the computer on a light load?\n* Would the laptop noisy enough that I would not be able to use it in classes without disturbing others?\n* I also have 4 hours of classes on some days and want a minimum battery life of 5 hours. The laptop has a 75Wh battery, how well does that translate to battery life?\n* Is there a way to switch off features that are not being used to reduce these issues?\n* Are there other issues with laptops with dedicated GPU's that I don't know about?\n\nI'm wondering if these potential downsides would outweigh the convenience of having an onboard NVIDIA GPU, and whether I'd be better off getting a regular laptop and continue using the university clusters instead.

  "I know at least ASUS gaming laptops have a Silent profile, where the fans won’t start unless the CPU/GPU reach a certain temperature",
  "Thank you! Do you have a recommendation for an ASUS laptop?",
  "If you can find a Zephyrus G14 I’m your budget, it is an excellent laptop with an amazing battery life",
  "MSI and Lenovo also have modes to reduce fan noise",

  "IdeaPad Pro 5 or HP Envy x360? I need to choose ASAP Hi guys,\n\nI am looking for a laptop to buy for CS Bachelor. I limited the options to few laptops but I couldn't decide. I am between two models particularly. One of them is Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 Gen 8 ([https://www.lenovo.com/ch/edu/cheducation/de/p/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-500-series/ideapad-pro-5-gen-8-(16-inch-amd)/len101i0070](https://www.lenovo.com/ch/edu/cheducation/de/p/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-500-series/ideapad-pro-5-gen-8-(16-inch-amd)/len101i0070)) with Ryzen 7 7735HS, 16 GB ram, 1 TB SSD, 2K 120Hz screen. The other one is HP Envy x360 ([https://www.hp.com/ch-en/shop/product.aspx?id=81L80EA&opt=UUZ&sel=NTB](https://www.hp.com/ch-en/shop/product.aspx?id=81L80EA&opt=UUZ&sel=NTB)) with i7 1355U, 16 GB ram, 1 TB SSD and a FHD OLED screen. I don't plan to use the touch screen feature of HP, and battery life is important to me. I wanted to ask you for your opinions. Plus there are two other possible models, one is Asus Vivobook and other is Dell Vostro 3520. Both has similar features with Lenovo and HP. Thank you for your help in advance. ",
  "Lenovo has a higher refresh rate and a higher resolution display. Which would be nice to have for CS. As for battery life take a look at some reviews on YouTube.",
  "Help me decide on my next laptop I recently purchased a 4K monitor to hook up to my laptop. My laptop is pretty ancient and unfortunately is not capable of displaying 3840 x 2160 on the monitor. So i've been looking around to upgrade the laptop which was probably due anyway.\n\nI mostly use my computer for internet, YouTube, Twitch and some work stuff on MS Office and occasional coding (nothing complex at this stage). I don't need anything resembling a gaming laptop although would appreciate some good speakers if I watch something on the computer.\n\n\\- Screen size is important to me and I would like to stick with 15.6 inch, or go to 16 inch. I am used to a matte screen and some of the glossy screens I have seen seem to suffer from glare / reflective which puts me off from going glossy.- I would prefer to have a number pad on the keyboard too.- Longevity: I would like something which will last me at least 5 years so am going for 16GB RAM.- **Must be able to display 4K resolution when connected to my 4K monitor**\n\nAfter much looking around I think I have narrowed my search down to the below choices. I have concerns about each and hopefully someone can help :) I should add that the Samsung and Lenovo are both similar in price.\n\n\\- **Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro**: It has an i7-1260P CPU, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, HDMI 2.0, Thunderbolt ports. The computer is thin and light, it has a number pad. The speakers are decent sounding. The computer is perfect for my requirements except the **screen**. The screen is a glossy AMOLED panel displaying 1920 x 1080 at 60hz. In the store I found it a bit reflective. The major concern is whether it will suffer from dead pixels and burn-in which I have read can happen with OLED displays and maybe I should stick with an LCD / IPS screen. The computer comes with a **1 year warranty** so after that I am at risk. [Samsung](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/samsung-galaxy-book2-pro-15.6-laptop-intel-core-i7-512-gb-ssd-silver-10236963.html)\n\n\\- **Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro**:  It has an AMD Ryzen 5, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 16\" WQXGA+ displaying 2560 x 1600 and I believe up to 120hz, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 4GB GPU. I believe the computer has a matte display and a number pad. Reviews generally seem to be good. Some comments that it runs a bit noisy. The ports are not as good as on the Samsung. When I search for information on the product there's some mixed messaging about the **HDMI**. The following link states it's HDMI 2.0 and so does Lenovo site. Some of the YouTube reviews said it's 1.4b which means it wouldn't be able to display 4K at 60hz - they could be wrong of course. Some reviews mention the computer shuts down after going to sleep - i'm not sure if this is user error or can't be changed. The Lenovo comes with a **2 year warranty**. [Lenovo](https://www.johnlewis.com/lenovo-ideapad-5-pro-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-16-inch-wqxga-storm-grey/p6404704)\n\n\\- **Dell XPS 15:** I could maybe push the budget and stretch to an XPS 15 with an i7 processor and 16GB RAM. If I buy new unused from the outlet and use a discount code. The panel is glossy but meant to have anti-glare on it. There's no number pad which is disappointing. Unlike the Samsung and Lenovo, the RAM is not soldered and can be upgraded in future.  I have read reviews about it being a bit unreliable, overheating, the fans running often to cool the computer.\n\nIf you have made it this far, I really appreciate the time and any advice / guidance which you can offer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8lwxwaqa1ua1.jpg?width=1325&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbfe1eca2126ceb8b536b4966f3bc4c25773fa3c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/schfmx2oa1ua1.jpg?width=943&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=930a67235c99a5ddc2496baa67a71d06be3921f5",
