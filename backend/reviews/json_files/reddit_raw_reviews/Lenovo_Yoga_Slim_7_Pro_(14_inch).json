  "Am I about to make a mistake? Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i \nhttps://www.lenovo.com/au/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-pro-series/lenovo-yoga-pro-7i-gen-10-aura-edition-14-inch-intel/83kfcto1wwau2\n\nI am thinking if buying this. Cannot for the life of me find a single review directly of this model. Or a related one with different specs. It's all Slims and 2-in-1s. \n\n\nWHY AM I LOOKING AT IT?\nNot for gaming, other than maybe a light cozy thing here or there. It's so I can do office type and browsing functions while I am on the move and potentially some light music production. \n\n\nThin and light would be good. Want to be able to carry it around without hassle. \n\n\nNeed a good battery life but not insane. 8 hours would be fine. Sales tech said this would get at least 10. I'd reduce the refresh rate to 60hz, I won't need 120 most of the time. Presumably that'll eek more time out. \n\n\nBest I can tell CPU should be pretty future proofed. Seems basically as good as it gets for this category. \n\n\nRAM is confirmed by sales tech as dual channel. Unfortunately there doesn't seem an option to do 64gb instead which would give me future proofing comfort. \n\nBut as far as I can tell the RAM (LPDDR5X-8533MT/s) is basically top of the line for portable laptops. \n\n\nWHAT AM I WORRIED ABOUT?\nMain thing keeping me from pulling the trigger is glossy screen as I like bright rooms and sitting outside haha but... seems like nearly all of then have that. I assume I can maybe put a screen film over it of some kind? \n\n\nSecond thing is overheat potential. Without reviews on this specific configuration, seems a risk the ultra 9 285H might get SPICY. I presume I can maybe manage this by reducing power in the settings...",
  "Idk about this model specifically as I'm researching a 2in1 to purchase, why are all the Lenovo 2 in 1's so much more expensive than their pro counterparts?? My local retailers won't even stock them as their price is just absurd.\n\nAlso, because these brands make multiple laptops of the same format with different specs, usually have to look at them as a whole, then the changed specs individually. Look for reviews on the yoga/yoga pro (compared to other brands, some great reviews and minimal complaints), then make sure the cpu is good.",
  "Hmmm. Interesting. What region are you in? I'm in Victoria Australia and here it seems like the 2 in 1s are pretty affordable, they just use the less heavy duty specs (Vs instead of Hs). \n\n\nBut yeh that's kind of what I've had to make do with RE reviews. Kind of gettins the vibe of similar names and judhing it off that. My exact thoughts on it. The complexity of the seemingly similar but not quite same laptop models with different nearly the same name and completely different specs has made the review space completely fucked to navigate hahaha.",
  "Im in QLD, I should have clarified for the same specs, the 2in1's are more expensive. Currently I'm trying to find specs for a version JB hifi sell but Lenovo have removed completely from their website. Of course they do that and JB don't specify.",
  "To be fair JBs laptop prices are uniformly atrocious hahaha. They charge amounts for specs that are several tiers below what that price point should provide. I think their target market is mostly people who know nothing about computers haha",
  "That's true, but jb for at least one of the models is the exact same price as Lenovo website, without the 3-5 week wait.",
  "Yeh they sometimes might be ok generally, but i notice A lot of the lenovo website prices themselves are inflated. \nLike the one I posted is apparently 40% off, as are other ones im considering which are slightly less speccy, full price of 3.2k or so. But the literal same laptop at a retailer like HN or Office Works is like 2.3k full price. \nSo lenovo website on sale is a genuine sale price but not on sale they're wildly expensive.",
  "Getting a new laptop through my work at a discounted price, looking for stylus note taking, modelling, gaming and office use. Help me choose \nI'm able to get one of these laptops through my workplace for a somewhat discounted price with a 3 year warranty. My main use case is going to be writing some notes on the device as a tablet with a stylus, lightish gaming, CAD and video editing. Then some general office and Uni work. So Clair Obscur is a game I want to play, some light modelling in blender maybe or autocad, and editing 1080p footage and possibly short 4k video in Da vinci. Any thoughts? May be able to get others a slightly lower cost than standard but curious to see what people think. Thanks.\n\nMSI Summit E16 AI Studio A1VETG-002, 32GB RAM, 1TB, RTX 4050 – price £792\nSKU # 9S7-159621-002\nMSI Summit E16 AI Studio A1VETG-002UK Intel Core Ultra 7 155H Hybrid (2-in-1) 40.6 cm (16\") Touchscreen Quad HD+ 32 GB LPDDR5-SDRAM 1 TB SSD NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) Windows 11 Pro Black\n \nAsus Proart PX13 32GB RAM, 2TB RTX 4070 – price £1604.40\nModel: HN7306WI\nASUS ProArt PX13 OLED HN7306WI 2-in-1 Laptop | 13.3 Inch 3K OLED Touchscreen | AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 | 32GB RAM | 2TB PCIe SSD | Backlit Keyboard | Windows 11 | Stylus Pen : Amazon.co.uk: Computers & Accessories\n \nLenovo Yoga Slim 7i Gen 9 Aura Edition (15\" Intel) – price £943.20 \nPart Number: 83HMCTO1WW\nLenovo Yoga Slim 7i Gen 9 Aura Edition (15″ Intel) | AI-Fueled Creativity | 83HMCTO1WWGB4 | Lenovo UK\n \nLenovo Thinkpad E14 Gen 7 – price £764.40\nPart Number: 21U2CTO1WW\nThinkPad E14 Gen 7 (14 inch Intel) | Next-Gen AI PC for Business | 21U2CTO1WWGB2 | Lenovo UK \n\nAny particular standout? Very tempted by the Proart but not sure if the £800 extra over the MSI is justified for better specs. The Lenovo are more hoping the IGPU will be enough for me, instead being lighter for portability and better battery. Unfortunately can't find many reviews on the MSI, I know the 4050 isn't great but wondering it it'll do for me. Thanks.",

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "ASUS Zenbook S14 vs. Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura 15 vs. LG gram Pro 16/17 - which would you choose? I have been looking at these three laptops and am beginning to feel as though there isn't much difference beyond the screen size and whether it's OLED or IPS. Is there anything I'm missing? Would you choose one over the other for reasons beyond screen size preference, and if so, why? Would you not recommend anything about these processors or specs for any reason?

  "Thank you for your detailed list and preferences it makes it really easy to compare! Notebookcheck made a comparison of both laptops, and I think they will be really helpful for you. [Asus review.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-VivoBook-14X-OLED-K3405-Laptop-Review-No-frills-multimedia-laptop-with-Core-i5-13500H-and-vibrant-2-8K-OLED-display.726592.0.html) [Lenovo review.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-Slim-7-Pro-X-laptop-review-The-Asus-VivoBook-14-alternative.697031.0.html#nbc_nbcompare_div) \n\nThe Asus' advantages are much better battery life (8 hours vs 5 on Lenovo) and an HDMI port. The Lenovo has a better screen, thermals, fan noise, and build quality. In terms of performance, the Asus has noticeably higher CPU performance than the Ryzen 9 according to the review. Since you are considering the Ryzen 7, this will be an even larger gap. However, Lenovo has noticeably better GPU performance.\n\nI would personally choose the Asus between the two, since battery life and CPU performance is really important, and the GPU is only 10% behind. But the biggest factor would have to be QuickSync, which is some magic Intel hardware acceleration that [beats the Desktop RTX 3090 in some cases of video editing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ovRtmTxjuE) And since you will do video editing, getting Intel will be much better. \n\nSince you say you work on your lap, these laptops get really hot on the bottom (50 for Lenovo and 54 for Asus). This is the case for most laptops with a dGPU. I really don't know the situation in your laptop market, but why don't you consider getting a Lunar Lake laptop? You will get respectable iGPU performance since the 3050 is not that strong anyway. You will also get much better CPU performance, portability, thermals, battery life, and build quality.",
  "Hi, can u share why tho?",

  "Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9 (2024) vs. HP Spectre 14 (2024) - Quick Comparison / Personal Impressions Hi all,\n\ndecided to post a quick review / comparison because I see a lot of people are facing similar buying decision.\n\nI own an Intel 11th generation Yoga 7 Slim 14 inch laptop and am looking for something new. The Yoga 7 is really creaky, has really bad speakers and - main reason I want to switch - only has 60hz. My main monitor and smartphone have 120hz and for me its the biggest innovation in years. I only have a laptop paired with an eGPU (RTX 3060) for desk setup, which works pretty well. I also thought it would be nice to have a 2-in-1 laptop for travelling, long haul flights etc.\n\nTo cut a long story short, after some research I decided on the HP Spectre 14 and the Yoga 9i 2-in-1, both with the latest Intel CPU. I pre-ordered both, so I received each of them with almost no reviews (and therefore no BIAS) out there.\n\nBoth versions had new Intel CPU 155H, 120hz (glossy) OLED screen. The Spectre came with 32GB, the Yoga 2-in-1 with 16GB. I wont talk much about performance because it doesnt really matter for me. There are now benchmarks out to compare.\n\nthe sad news first: I returned both laptop\n\n||HP Spectre 14|Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Design|+/- Personally, I didnt really like the design. Its way better / professional predecessor, but I still dont like the bulkiness and the cut corners of the spectre. Looks somehow awkward for me.|No great design as well. Its somehow looks like an unproportional burger. The top of the laptop is smaller then the bottom, in combination with its rounded and glossy edges it looks very akward. I chose colour \"cosmic blue\" which is okay, but a fingerprint magnet|\n|Build Quality|+ Very nice build quality, solid materials - not creaky at all. Very good hinge.|+ Very good, cant complain. Not creaky at all.|\n|Speakers|+ Very good speakers. Quality reduces drastically if you use in tablet mode, since the speakers actually play in the opposite direction|+ I think the best speakers I ever heard on a laptop, since its basically a huge rotating soundbar. This is great in tablet and tent mode as well, because the sound is still going in your direction|\n|Trackpad|+ Very nice haptic trackpad, definitely the best trackpad I ever used (on track with Macbook Pro)|-/+ Trackpad is only ok. Its not haptic, which is a dissapointment in their flagship|\n|Keyboard|+/- Keyboard was ok, but I don't understand the hype about it. I might be biased because I use Lenovo notebooks at work and home for years.|+ Keyboard is nice. But as said, Im biased / used to use Lenovo keyboards. I didnt like the additional row right to the \"return\" button|\n|Display|- Overall, a very nice OLED screen. But no matter.  The screen was absolutely terrible in terms of the 'screen door effect', I couldnt stand the graininess. I had read before that this could be a problem, but I was sure I could get used to it, but in reality it was an absolute nightmare.                   - Another annoying issue with the screen is that it is barely dimmable. I often use the laptop in bed/dark surroundings to stream something before going to sleep. The lowest dim level is still super bright. You have to use extra software to dim it.|- Nice OLED as well. Drastically less Screen door effect to a level I could live with. Also, its dimmable to very low brightnesss out of the box. Unfortunately the screen is super glossy. I mean, so glossy that in dark enviroment even the backlight of the keyboard is reflected.|\n|Other|- The \"Power On\" button is illuminated constantly, which is very annoying|-|\n\nAs I said, I have returned both laptops. I paid around €1700 for each and each had major faults that did not justify the price for me. The main reasons were the displays, I think glossy is just not for me. While I could live with the Yoga's display, I really missed the haptic touchpad and hated that it only came with 16GB.\n\nThe search continues. I think im done with looking for 2-in-1 and will get a tablet instead. Basically all I need is \"good/very good speakers, haptic t rackpad, non glossy and minimum 90hz screen\".  I have now pre-ordered the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4, which has a matte display and a haptic touchpad, unfortunately it is only 13.5\".  I also assume that the speakers will be bad. Will keep you posted :)\n\nHope it helped!",
  "I'm deciding between these 2. The 2-1 format would be useful for document reading etc, but the glossy screen issue is a deal breaker.   \n  \nCan anyone attest to the effectiveness of a matt screen protector to counter act the reflection?",
  "THANK YOU. Finally, someone who actually addresses the screen door effect in both flagship models. I work in the professional visual industry and need crystal clear displays, or at least with less graininess like e.g. Surfaces. I got both the Yoga 7i and Spectre for comparison and it drove me insane. I'm returning both and ordered the 9i now after reading your review - I found a model with 32GB RAM.\n\nOut of curiosity (and to better justify my money spent...) - Would you surmise you would've kept the Yoga 9i if only it had 32 Gigs of RAM?",
  "Do you know if either laptop supports legacy S3 sleep?",
  "lmfaooo please give an update fast. I was looking to buy either of these and now I don't want to.",
  "I am looking for a similar laptop. Thinkbook 13x is really tempting but 14“ would be even better. A bit outside of the box but the new DELL precision 5490 is on the game for me. 14“ Matte bright IPS touchscreen, nice CPUs, etc. You can choose it without dGPU.\nOr maybe upcoming new HP elitebook x360 if it comes with a H CPU.\nMaybe Huawei Matebook X 2024 is an option, no release date on Europe yet.",
  "u/peyta30 FYI, the 2-in-1 Gen 9 is now available with a Sensel haptic touchpad upgrade in the \"Build Your PC\" tool. Right now it's showing as a $60 upgrade, but once the 2-in-1 goes on sale, that discount will also apply to the haptic touchpad.\n\nFYI, the haptic touchpad in the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4 is not from Sensel.",
  "Hey so I've also been tied between the Lenova Yoga 9i pro and HP Spectre 360 16 inch. Both in 32 GB. The main difference is HP uses a OLED screen but 2800X1800 Res while Lenova Uses LED 3200X2000 Res. The lenovoa looked brighter. The other difference is the HP is 2 in 1 where as the Lenova has the Ultra 9 core processor and HP has the Ultra 7 core processor. So one is newer processor and higher resolution. The other is 2 in 1 and OLED screen oh and the HP has much better speakers. My issue now is that there is another Lenova yoga 9i option which is only $200 more which comes with a Mini LED screen, a higher graphics card 4060X, and 1200 Nit brightNess which is exponentially higher then HP and most other Laptops. The ONLY problem I've seen with that higher Lenova 9i option is that the battery is listed at 5 hours but people have claimed it barely lasts 3 hours. Sigh* If it didn't have the battery issue, I'd get the fully loaded yoga 9i in a heart beat so now I'm still tied between the original 9i or HP Spectre both in 16 inch 32 GB with same graphic card.",
  "Sorry I don't know that!",
  "I'm trying out new Asus g14 and skipping touch screen for now.",
  "Hi! That sounds interesting. On which configurator are you referring? I can't find the option on German or US configurator. Anyways, does that mean that you now provide a 80x135 haptic trackpad? \n\nThanks",
  "fsfs lmk. Touchscreen isnt a dealbreaker for me. Just on the fence rn bec he sale for the Hp spectre ends tmr.",
  "Oops! My mistake.

  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",

  "Laptop purchase advice -ASUS VivoBook Pro OLED 15 Laptop M3500QC-L1081T vs ASUS TUF FA507RE 15.6\" I am looking to replace my old macbook pro and have been looking for something decently priced and powerful. Good enough to run multiple microsoft or adobe apps at the same time for school and also to game on (mostly non AAA games).
