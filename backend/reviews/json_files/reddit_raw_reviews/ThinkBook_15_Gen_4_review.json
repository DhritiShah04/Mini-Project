  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience). I have a Lenovo duet 5 now which I love but the snapdragon is feeling a little long in the tooth when I have more than a few tabs open.\n\nI guess my heart says Lenovo but brain said MacBook Air.",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop. Having good speakers is a great bonus for the Lenovo for me, as well as a bright screen. Don't need maximum power as for heavy workload I want to rely on remote desktops.",
  "Check your local best buys, in my area (SE Michigan) the Lenovo is on BB as a used excellent for $530 which is the right price point. So see if you can find one in your area for that price",
  "Unfortunately not near me but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nWhat do you think the chances of the kompanio lasting close to apple silicon?",
  "Not sure, thats a ChatGPT quesiton lol \n\nHappy hunting, hopefully you can find one soon.   I hear that they are high-end Chromebooks with Spandragon x Elite processors coming; I'm hoping they are here just before the holiday season.",
  "Ended up with the m4 MacBook air. It went on sale on Amazon for 750(!) and I can't find the Lenovo near me. Also mixed in the surface laptop for fun but the air just seems too good. Thanks again for your help!",
  "Need help choosing a laptop I'm a student on a tight budget looking for a high-performance “beast” laptop. I’ve shortlisted a few models but reviews are mixed — each has pros and cons.

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",

  "NEVER buy asus laptops they are masters in pc motherboards but recently asus is horrible in laptops and their drivers and everything. for you or generally speaking Lenovo should always be your first option because it is with no doubt the best preformance per value in the market or you could also get a HP which are great but i favor Lenovo. and the ideapad slim 5 is THE BEST option, it has the best build quality and also does not break the bank.",
  "Hard time choosing a new laptop. So I currently am using a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, and am planning on upgrading because: A) It is not powerful enough, and B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nI am a student and will primarily be using the laptop for school work, so it needs to be portable and a comfortable weight to bring with me to and from class. I love how portable my 13\" Air is. I've done a LOT of research over the past two years, but never bit the bullet, but I feel like now is the time, and so I've committed to buying one now.\n\nMy use cases (in order of importance): School, Music Production, Photoshop, Gaming\n\nI don't play a lot of games but it would be nice to have a machine to play some Civ 6 or even some other, more intensive games like BO2/BO3 Zombies (and MAYBEEEE some RDR2) when I am on a plane for a long time. I want something that's decent on battery life, I don't spend all day at school, maybe 4 hours at most on a given day, so I want something that'll last me that long doing just school work without having to even worry about bringing a charger.\n\nNow, I've looked at like tens of laptops, from gaming to notebook, and I've seen some I've considered like the Zenbook S16, Lenovo Slim 7i Aura, Zenbook 14, Zenbook A14, but I've narrowed it down to a couple:\n\nZephyrus G14/G16 - The clear winner for me, problem is it is just too expensive, and the only models that go on sale into my price range are the 4050 G14 and 4060 G16 models which I've heard may not be worth it. They don't go on sale super often, and the ones that do are open box. (Currently can get the 4050 model for $1499 CAD open box)\n\nZenbook Duo 2024 (Ultra 9, 32GB, 1TB, 60hz 1080p model) - I've toyed with the idea of having this laptop for a while. My PC setup at home has 3 monitors and I absolutely love it, and could see myself getting genuine use out of both screens when writing an assignment, key word being WHEN I am doing an assignment, which isn't an every day thing. I don't think it would be powerful enough to handle any gaming at all. Surprisingly, this is actually cheaper than both the G14 and G16 Models I would be getting. (Currently can get it Refurb-Excellent for $1519 CAD)\n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 15\" - This just came out, and I feel like 15\" is the perfect size for me to be honest. I can get the spec with the Ryzen 7 260, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD (will add another in the future), and a 5060 8GB card for within my price range, around $1750 all in. It's around 4 pounds which is the heaviest of the three, but is also the fastest of the three. It's so new that there isn't a single review yet for it. (Brand new for $1750 CAD, could try and haggle it at Lenovo)\n\nThese are my three ideas right now in terms of what to get. Does anyone have any recommendations? Anyone with these laptops have advice?\n\nI'd not like to spend more than $2000 CAD.\n\nEDIT: In case it wasn't clear, this is not meant to be a desktop replacement; I already have one.",
  "Well you need to be aware of the fact that most gaming laptops have a dedicated gpu they are loud heavy and the battery life is 3hours at best and the performance is ass when on battery .\nSo you’ll want something with a powerful igpu like a Ryzen ai 300 series (the Ryzen 7 or 9 models) or the intel core ultra 200 series ( like the ultra 7 258v) these have the most powerful iGPUs currently available. Also their batter life is pretty good.",
  "Don't buy the Zenbook duo. It's more of a gimmick and not a good choice for your use case. \n\nGaming laptops all suffer from battery life. They always need to be plugged in. They don't last long. \n\nYou might want to get something with a modern AMD Ryzen 8000 series CPU. The integrated graphics are good for some light gaming. These CPU are also power efficient so you get good battery life.\n\nAsus Zenbook S16 and Zenbook 14 should be the models to consider. The models with AMD Ryzen CPUs.",

  "Which affordable laptop to buy? Light gaming and editing? So after countless hours of googling i need some help and advice. i am by no means a computer whiz and honestly trying to fully understand specs is doing my head in.\n\nSo my McBook Air M1 finally died and I have been loving my baby.

  "The 2020 King of Portable 2 in 1s: LG Gram 2 in 1 14 inch **EDIT 4 5 MONTHS LATER:** [New Lenovo Carbon Yoga leaked on it's way, might be just enough to compete with the Spin 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lenovo/comments/hh0xzf/in_the_blink_of_an_eye_it_seems_the_almost/)\n\nEDIT 3: Found the mystery, it's the [Acer Spin 5 13.5](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Acer-Spin-3-and-Spin-5-are-now-slimmer-and-get-a-much-needed-upgrade-to-Intel-Ice-Lake.449311.0.html) inch which comes with 3:2 aspect ratio, not the LG Gram. It's not as a wide as the 14 Gram/c940, but it's about as equal in dimensions as the Surface Book 2 (taller than 16:9 14 inch laptops). For this reason + the almost exact same specs as the Gram, it would make it as a solid contender for the real king of 2020 2 in 1 portables.\n\nSmall note: Lenovo's c940 14 inch recieved a BIOS update which now gives about full 10 hour battery life(4K version, UHD probably gets a lot more), ALSO NOW coming close for that 2020 crown. At this point, it's all up to your tastes to which really deserves it.\n\nOriginal post:EDIT 2: So it seems that the aspect ratio of 3:2 in the Gram 2 in 1 was misinformation from a video, as it's apparently a 16:9 ratio instead. I'd still say this 2 in 1 is one of the best since it actually provides a bigger battery with a lot less weight than normal 14 inch models\n\nOriginal post:\n\nAfter a few companies have tried to make the perfect portable 2 in 1 convertible, LG actually went and finally pulled it off among it's competition with it's new Gram 2 in 1 14 inch announced at CES 2020.\n\nMain strong points:\n\nBigger and better battery life, which promises the highest battery life up to date for a 14 inch (not sure how much it was exactly, but I think it was about \\~70,000 mWh sized)\n\nOnly 2 in 1 to weight around 2.5 lb with that big of a battery and screen, making it's tablet mode really easy to use with maximum weight portability in mind\n\nGreat port selection up to HDMI and \\*Thunderbolt 3 (need confirmation there tho since previous Gram 2 in 1 did not have it, reviewer at CES said it might have it)\n\nAnd lastly, Intel's 10th gen chip with 11th gen Iris Plus Graphics for light gaming\n\nAs of now, only the Lenovo c940 could compete against this in the 14 inch category, but with relatively poor battery life and 0.5 pounds extra, the Gram seems to take the cake here. Honorable mentions I'd put the HP Spectre 13 inch late 2019 refresh (16:9 aspect ratio on a 13.3 inch screen tho, horrible design imo) and the new Samsung Galaxy Book Flex (which is like the XPS 13 2 in 1 but arguably better with some extra features with a 16:10 aspect ratio on 13.3 inch).\n\nMy only worries for the LG Gram 2 in 1 2020 so far: chassis hopefully is as sturdy as the c940 (or close to it since c940 has an excellent chassis durability), speaker system will probably not be as good obviously (c940 has Dolby Atmos 360 hinge, hopefully LG's sound will be not completely bad) and Thunderbolt 3's inclusion. Other than those worries, seems to be on it's way to being the 2020 king of portable 2 in 1's.\n\nNote: Did not consider any 2 in 1 15 inches and above since all have weights more than 4 lb and big form factor (while I would say the new HP Spectre x360 15 2020 is the best new coming relatively portable 15 inch 2 in 1, but weighing at 4 lb with a big chassis not many bags can fit, it would basically come at 2nd best portable 2 in 1 for 2020, in case you're looking in the 15 category. If gaming is your thing in the 2 in 1 category then this new HP will probably best fit your needs).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Small but important note: also worried the Gram might not have Windows Hello IR facial recognition, as that I believe is fundamental for any 2 in 1 to have while utilizing in tablet or tent mode. Hopefully it comes with IR additionally to it's finger print Windows Hello scanner to get the real title of (at least almost) perfect 2 in 1 ultraportable.",

  "Valid point, but I'm lead to believe all 2 in 1's suffer from this. As an owner of a Lenovo Yoga c940 UHD 14' and past owner of a 2017 HP Spectre x360 13', can confirm both units had/have issues with thermals and sometimes fans spun up while even being at idle. Thankfully I discovered undervolting which quickly fixed that issue pretty fast, as fans (which were always an issue on c940's) barely turn on anymore with idle temps of 39-44 degrees. Before it would almost be at 54-60 on idle occasionally with Windows doing background processes, but undervolting did the trick just right.",
  "Oh well rip, I guess you're right. I saw a top CES laptops for 2020 video and it had mentioned a 3:2 for the 2 in 1. Can't find the original but now that I see your video up close yeah, that's definitely 16:9. I ain't mad tho since I decided to stick with my 14 inch c940 with 16:9 too so now I know I'm not missing much haha.\nThanks for clarifying!",
  "Late comment but, figured which was had the 3:2 aspect ratio: turns out it's the [Acer Spin 5 13.5 inch 2020](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Acer-Spin-3-and-Spin-5-are-now-slimmer-and-get-a-much-needed-upgrade-to-Intel-Ice-Lake.449311.0.html). If you're interested in buying a 2 in 1, that one is definitely now in the competition thanks to that ratio. Edited main post comment.",
  "I'm pretty sure that you can? Just cuz a laptop comes with a proprietary power brick doesn't mean you can't use USB-C to charge it. I've seen even 15 inch which has proprietary and can still charge with USB-C.",
  "Depends on the laptop OFC. Most 2 in 1s pack really small single fan dual heatpipe coolers which are totally inadequate for anything hotter than a dual core and low end GPU. I think a few 15 inch 2 in 1s with dual fan coolers can be relatively cool under loads, but yea, most do get too hot",
  "[deleted]",
  "I have the 2019 version and charge via USB-C all the time so I'm sure you can do it.",
  "For the case of 15 inch, most of them do provide at least minimum adecuate cooling since they use actual dedicated GPUs for gaming/graphic design. Only reason why I excluded them from my analysis is due to body weight (4lb is honestly a bit too much for a 2 in 1) and screen size makes chassis far too big to carry around conventionally in backpacks for most people.",
  "Haha wow. Any reason specifically you didn't like all the ones you returned? What feature do you find them missing so much to not upgrade your c920?",
  "Hi u/teamblades44, what kind of USB-C charger do you use for something with such a big battery (I mean, can any USB-C charger charge as fast as the proprietary power brick?)",
  "Why do you think 4 pounds is too much? My 14 inch laptop is 4 pounds and I wouldn't say it's heavy",
  "You can use any 65 or 90 W USB-c charger.  I think it charges a tiny bit slower but even when I'm using it it still is charging it rather than discharging.",
  "I classify 4 pounds to be a bit on the heavy side for 2 main reasons (one mostly personal other a bit more objective)\n\n1. I carry my laptop in an over the shoulder backpack with a bit of cables and charging equipment. I used to always carry with me a 1.3 pound battery in that bag alongside my old Surface Pro 5, which gave it a bit of weight to the bag but manageable. With the 3 pounds from my c940 and 1.3 from the battery, I do feel shoulder pain when getting home most of the time, so I opted for carrying it my main backpack separately.\n2. My c940 14 inch at 3 pounds is juuust the borderline of what I would consider ideal weight for a 2 in 1. Using it in tablet mode is roughly hard due to weight + sharp edges which stab a bit into the hands, tho I do find 3 pounds to be good enough that the laptop can be held with one hand a bit relatively easy. But at 4 pounds, I wouldn't see myself ever using it in tablet mode and one hand usage would be on the bare minimum there. This is where the new Gram stands out with a killer 3:2 aspect ratio perfect for tablet mode plus an ideal 2.5 weight\n\nWhile I get this might be more personal since it's 1 pound difference from the c940, I know people like to carry light when on the go, and a 15 inch laptop for me is a bit too much for super portability too. Mostly this is just personal tastes, but a 3:2 aspect ratio with 14 inch wideness honestly would be more than good of a display for any needs I would say imo. It all comes down to personal tastes.",
  "If you use it in tablet mode, the weight doesn't matter...\n\nLike it could weight 10 pounds but that won't really affect how you use it as a tablet\n\nBut for day to day carry, I could totally understand wanting something lighter",
  "It actually does matter quite a bit haha, try holding the tablet in the air as you would an iPad to read and your arms will get tired pretty darn quick. Most reviewers always mention this for 2 in 1's since weight is what normally restricts tablet mode for most of them, except this here Gram which finally fixed the issue in a lot of senses.",
  "You don't hold it in your hands. You place it flat on a table like a tablet or drafting table",
  "As someone who suffers from constant neck pains from looking down too much while studying, holding the tablet in the air both in desk and in bed is a godsend feature for me. Really the only think I'll miss from my Surface Pro 5 tbh, since that only weighs a mere 1.7 pounds. I know other people in my school do this hence why I decided to mention it.",

  "HP Dragonfly Review (16GB, 4k, 1TB version)  \n\nI’ve been looking to shift to a hybrid/2 in 1 for some time now. I was hoping that would be with Apple but we'll all know where that has gone. Maybe it will change with Apple's switch to ARM, but with Apple's attitude to what customer want, I probably had more chance of falling pregnant through wind pollination.\n\nI generally write in a light hearted manner, so if you're easy insulted, please stop here. Chances are if I've written something to offend you, it's probably my weak attempt at humour.\n\nFor those looking at the context of my switch, I'll give you my background including my experience with my first attempt at a windows switch. It's long, and probably somewhat boring so if you want to skip it, go to the end of the next section and save yourself the time. If you're bored with nothing better to do, feel free to plod on.\n\nI was too lazy to clean it or spend too much time on photos so I apologise in advance for the lack of ultrabook hardware porn\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7vt2n26yy951.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51f11bce035a7cb651323db6ddb90bfae5f67e55\n\n# My History with Apple and Microsoft (Skip this if you're easily bored)\n\nA long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away (Australia), I decided to give Microsoft a go after more than 10 years on Mac, just to see what hybrids were like. I purchased a Surface Pro 3.\n\nLet's just say it was a huge mistake, or it was for me. Windows 8 was terrible as a tablet and desktop operation system, and when I upgraded to Windows 10, I regretted the decision further.\n\nThe first versions of windows 10 were unstable resulting in a terrible user experience. It was sluggish, search didn't work properly. It had promise but my biggest concern was that if Microsoft would release a half baked product like this, what were future releases going to be like. Basic problems existed like having to change my display scaling or resolution when I moved from using an external display to the surface display.\n\nI think the final nail in the coffin was when Microsoft decided to switch on automatic updates where it used your machine to update other machines globally and failed to tell users about what they were doing.\n\nI lost $300 of mobile data the first day and another $200 on the second before I found the problem. Yes, data in Australia was that expensive those days. I complained to Microsoft Australia, they couldn't even be bothered to respond.\n\nIt took 6 months of follows up to even get them to email back to my complaint, and believe it or not, their actual response was \"what do you expect us to do?\". How about a #(\\*\\^&$ apology for one? By that stage, I'd sold my Surface Pro 3, and purchased a quad core MacBook Pro 15.\n\nFrom there, I extended my Mac acquisition with Macbook Pro 13 as a lightweight machine for business travel and an iPad Pro which I used for note taking, mark ups, with the Apple pencil which I loved. For a period I was happy, like most marriages, it knew there were compromises. I still lived in hope that Apple would produce a hybrid so I didn't have to lug around two devices.\n\nThe cracks in my relationship started to appear progressively when Apple progressively removed all upgrade capability and when it got to a point of making iMac drives non-user replaceable, I was starting to beat my chest like an angry 5 year old. It's a desktop, why the hell would you make the drives non-replaceable, other than ripping off the consumer by facing them to upgrade? I was planning on the new Mac Pro when Apple released a $7,000 screen with a $1000 stand alongside a stupidly overpriced $7,000 Mac Pro that came with a 256 GB drive. What the? They produced a screen for the 12\n\nI knew there had always been an Apple tax, but now it had shifted to an idiot tax. With the sad realisation that the Apple execs had taken one too many million dollar paychecks and were clearly spending more time snorting cocaine off hookers than working on a realistic to go market strategy for customers like me, I decided to depart MacLand and move to the potentially greener pastures of Windowland.\n\nThe first step in my departure was a desktop to replace my 5 year old quad core Mac. I built a stupidly powerful desktop for about $5,000, RAID, Gen 4 S5D's, Ryzen 9 etc. I won't bore you more than that, suffice to say I could probably hack Pornhub with it (why do people always want to hack the Pentagon?), if I knew how to hack.\n\nPart two was the replacement of my 2018 Macbook Pro 13 and my iPad Pro which weren't necessarily due for replacement. I didn't have to replace them but I we're in lock down and I don't feel like having multiple operating systems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cu530sayy951.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c43e7666f6b447db4b1d976b72e873783248bd49\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# My evaluation criteria\n\nI wanted an exec level compact laptop that still had enough power to handle some of my creative requirements.\n\nThe devices I evaluated at the time were:\n\n* Lenovo Yoga X1 Gen 4\n* Lenovo Yoga X1 Gen 5\n* HP spectre X360\n* Dell XPS 13 2 in 1\n* HP Dragonfly\n* MS Surface Book 3\n\nI ruled out the Surface Book 3 (no 4k, no LTE, no USB-C) and the Yoga X1 Gen 5 (no 4K in Australia) as I had some timeline constraints. Timeline constraints are the same reason I didn't wait for the 5G Dragonfly.\n\nI ruled out the Spectre which isn't available in the LTE model if you want a 4k Screen. While LTE wasn't mandatory, I figured I already had the Dragonfly from HP with it. The performance differences between the 8th and 10th gen weren't huge.\n\nI could technically have ruled out the XPS but I decided to try all 3. The Dragonfly was a little harder to find in a store but a friend had been issued one by his company.\n\nUltimately, my evaluation looked something like this:\n\n* Construction - Pretty good for all 3 but the Dragonfly just took it.\n* Keyboard - Lenovo (Dragonfly wasn't as far off as I expected)\n* Screen - Dragonfly\n* Weight - Dragonfly\n* Battery - Dragonfly\n\nThe Dell, surprisingly enough didn't stand out in any categories. I know this will probably piss off some Dell but its just my perspective\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/behnaprdyy951.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45220cba5c8b53f2810b0148390be26c1dce01e4\n\n# Design & construction\n\nIn the box you get:\n\n* Dragonfly\n* Charger\n* Pen and pen charger\n* Usual paper crap, warranties, the kid of stuff you never read unless there is a problem\n\nComing from Apple gear, I'm used to aesthetically pleasing designs (and carrying 400 adapters). Like it or not, Apple has been good at it. It's also an area where many Windows laptops traditionally suffered.\n\nThe Dragonfly is targeted more at executive levels. Yeah, you know those hypocrites at the top who skimp on your toilet paper quality to save $100 for the whole building, but spend a fortune on a top of the range laptop despite only using it for email.\n\nAs a result, looks are somewhere between a Margot Robbie and Chris Hemsworth, depending on your sexual preference. Absolutely beautiful. The blue is hard to describe, almost iridescent, amazing. Combined with the silver logo, it has looks to die for (so you're getting the bad ass version of Margot Robbie in Suicide Squad). I think this has to be one of best looking laptops on the market. The photos don't do it justice.\n\nI liked the blue so much that I couldn't put a grey mouse with it so I hunted down a teal blue version of my Logitech MX 2S. I don't match mice, but this laptop has driven me to match mice. What has happened to me?\n\nOverall, it's hard not to give it 10 out 10 for the looks except, in a moment (or two) of insanity, HP did something so idiotic you have to question what they were thinking.\n\nIn somewhat of a \"what the #$%& \" that you utter when a celebrity says something really stupid that makes you shake your head and question the depth of the IQ pool, HP spoilt it by putting a nice big \"Intel inside\" sticker right next to the fingerprint reader. To make matters worse, they couldn't even be bother to put mine on straight.\n\nAs if the kinds of users using this laptop are going to give a shit whether Intel is inside. They either bought it themselves (in which case they know) or they had an IT department do it and then they aren't the kind of users who care. Either way, care factor is somewhere between zero and none.\n\nYeah, I know you can remove the sticker, but you shouldn't have to. Given the sticker is removable, it drops it to a 9.75 instead of a 10.\n\nConstruction is what I would expect for the price range. Absolutely impeccable. It's rigid, well constructed. Drop proof, Milspec something or other, most likely to deal with exec tantrums or those frustrated with that Intel sticker.\n\nI could almost stop there and say its a near perfect laptop from a construction perspective, but sadly I can't. HP, again did something that needs a facepalm. They provided an amazing tiny 65W charger. It's compact, with a nice wrap around cable...and then they spoil the entire experience by attaching a thick 10m power cable to the tiny brick.\n\nOkay, it's not 10m, that's an exaggeration, but the cable between the wall socket and brick would rival the brick for size and weight when folded up. And the thickest conceivable cable. It's like this cable ate another 5 cables while no one was watching. A stand alone adapter would have been nice (like Apple provide). I. e. Without the cable. I also think they could have provided a shorter cable. The Dell comes with a half a meter cable which seems to be more practical (and smaller).\n\nI order a small 0.5m (20\") cable and an adapter which I will use to replace this. An unnecessary annoyance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2zmjs95gyy951.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfa6bc3f183e71bfd86dd8a991aacd118a796e4f\n\n# Weight\n\nThe weight on my version (which has the bigger battery) is 1.13kg's/2.5 pounds. The lighter version in 2.2 but not available with the 4k screen.\n\nThat's astounding. My 2018 12.9 iPad Pro with smart keyboard runs at 1070 grams with a smaller lower resolution screen. It's also lighter than the new iPad Pro 12.9 and Magic keyboard (3 Pounds/1.36 kg's) and the new Macbook Air (1.27kg's).\n\nIf Apple wants a lesson in construction, unlike the equally expensive and heavier Macbook Pro and Air, HP put a bigger battery, 4K display, fingerprint reader and LTE in the Dragonfly and both the battery and M2 are user replaceable. Some would try argue that Apple focus on aesthetics first, but even that HP got right. What they managed to produce a good looking light weight laptop without screwing the consumer by making it non-user replaceable?\n\nJohnny Ives would be shaking his head demanding to know what saucery was used on this laptop.\n\nWith the shift to the Dragonfly, I'm more than halving my carry weight from 2.4kg's to 1.13kg's, although the cable from the charger might weigh as much as a Macbook Pro.\n\n# The pen/stylus experience.\n\nThis is an area I was a little worried about. The Apple Pencil experience is really amazing. The latency is almost non-existent and the ink feels like it's coming out of the front of your pencil.\n\nThe HP Dragonfly matches this experience, and whilst I wouldn't class it as better, I also wouldn't class it as worse. It's just different. Latency isn't quite as good, but the Dragonfly has a softer feel, like the difference between writing with a pen and a marker.\n\nOverall, I think both are acceptable and choosing one would be hard. There are things I like and don't like with either.\n\nThe pen isn't dockable which is an annoyance, but I'm not sure where you would fit a pen this size on the Dragonfly. It would be nice if they offered some form of attachment to keep it on the side. Even a magnetic attachment point would be a step up to not having one.\n\nI like Apple's design of having a chargeable magnetic holder and so maybe that's something for them to think about in the next edition. Having a cable charger for the pencil isn't ideal.\n\n# Screen\n\nComing from the Macbook Pro 13\", the Dragonfly is amazing. I don't think the Macbook Pro is necessarily bad, but the difference in resolution between the two is noticeable. It's one of the best screens I've seen on a laptop.\n\nWould love it if HP included the privacy screen on the 4K version. It was frustrating having to pick between the privacy and 4K edition, but very little of what I do is confidential enough to worry about it.\n\nColour accuracy is good but not close to my desktop which has more expensive colour calibrated panel. I won't be using it for colour accurate work.\n\n# Keyboard & Mousepad\n\nApple used to have amazing keyboards. Then they went to this stupid butterfly design that makes it sound like you're a tap dancer while you are typing. I've tried some of the new Lenovo keyboards and I would put them as class leading. Miles ahead ahead of Apple.\n\nSo how does the Dragonfly fare? Surprisingly well, I’d say it’s pretty close to the Lenovo. Overall, about an 8.5/10 and fairly close to what I would class as a desktop quality experience.\n\nI’ve heard people say the keyboard on the Dragonfly feels cramped but I actually find it pretty good. Maybe I’m used to the small iPad keyboard but this is decent.\n\nThe mousepad is good. Multitouch features are pretty much expected on todays devices and it doesn't disappoint.\n\n# Ergonomics and handling\n\nIt's a pretty well designed device from a size and features perspective but it suffers a little in the ergonomics area, maybe as a result of the small size.\n\nThe location of the USB-C is somewhat confusing. On the same side as the mouse? Seems like an oversight along with the HDMI port. I would have put the HDMI and USB-C ports on the other side.\n\nOpening the lid isn't one of it's design features. There is a little ledge but it's not what I would qualify as simple, or as simple as it should be for a repetitive task.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI'm now bored with this review and running out of crap to write. Having covered pretty much everything I can think of, if I missed anything, let me know.\n\nWhat are my final thoughts? I'm damn impressed. This is without a doubt one of the best laptops I have purchased.\n\nI'm still getting used to Windows, but from a hardware perspective. HP gets a WOW from me and in a good way.",

  "Here's [a review of the latest HP Firefly G4 ](https://highperformancelaptops.com.au/reviews/hp-elite-dragonfly-g4-review) FYI.",
  "Laptop for Research Work with Specs Close to Surface Book 3 but with 11th Gen i7 or Similar? Current laptop: Lenovo Yoga 910 i7 7500U/16GB RAM/1 TB SSD/4k display \n\nFeatures I'm trying to improve: lack of pen support, webcam placement, processing power, high-pitched fan\n\nI'm a researcher and this would be my main device. I move a lot and so do not want an external monitor nor to switch to a desktop. I heavily use Office Suite, many Chrome tabs, video conferencing, Youtube, Adobe Photoshop + Illustrator, 4k photo editing, moderate video editing, and Python. I do not game at all.\n\nFeatures I am looking for in a laptop: \n\n11ith gen i7 CPU + \\*\\*\n\n32GB RAM + \\*\n\n4k or near resolution screen (not AMOLED) \\*\\*\n\n2-in-1 convertible with pen support \\*\\*\n\nUSB-A port built-in \\*\\*\\*\n\n15\" screen \\*\\*\n\n1080p webcam \\*\n\nBattery life \\~7 hours non-intensive use (web browsing/Youtube) \\*\\*\n\nHDMI port or Thunderbolt cherries on top, but not a requirement \\*\n\nThe closest laptop I have found seems to be the Microsoft Surface Book 3 minus the CPU. I'm rather dongle-averse outside of a USB-C to HDMI converter (so the idea of an external webcam is not the most exciting), so I've nixed the XPS 15 2-in-1. \n\nPrice isn't a consideration really, but sub-$4000 would be nice and I would be willing to go above that if there was a device that had everything above.\n\nAre there any laptops that fit this bill on the market? The closest I can see outside of the Surface Book 3 are the HP Dragonfly Elite G2/Max (but there you have to choose between 4k screen and 1080p webcam) which is \\~13\", Surface Pro 7+ (smaller profile, 1080p screen), and the Elitebook 1040 G8 (720p webcam, estimated delivery date of late July so would be waiting half a year in which time something else could release). I thought there were 2-in-1 Zbooks, but they seem to not be on the HP website anymore/not part of the latest generation and these anyway wouldn't have a better webcam.\n\nI find it kind of ironic that mostly smaller laptops have the specs I'm looking for, so it makes me think that larger convertibles might come to market with upgraded RAM and webcams, the latter especially, in the next cycle. Would that release be in the fall or is there a summer expo? \n\nAm I judging the CPU on the Surface Book 3 unfairly? The reviews online rail about how much worse 10th generation is than 11th and the test graphs seem to support that. I'm coming from 7th gen, but I also want this device to last 3-4 years minimum and don't want to commit to last generation's CPU if something is going to come out with all the specs within a year and I doubt there will be a surprise Surface Book 3 CPU refresh since it just came out. I would also not take advantage of the detachable tablet feature of the Surface Book 3 outside of flipping the screen to cover the keyboard in tablet mode, which is its main feature, so feels like a bit of a waste there? \n\nThanks for any help!",
  "I'm in the same market and haven't really seen anything beyond what you've mentioned. I'll probably just wait around until the SB3 gets a processor refresh.\n\nThe processor refresh on the SB2 occurred \\~1.5 years after the initial release, but hopefully this one would be sooner as there was quite a bit of negativity around the SB3 processors so MS should be quite clear on what they need to do.\n\nAs usual though, if you're always looking to buy the tech just over the horizon, you'll always be waiting.",
  "Dell XPS, HP Spectre x360, or Razer options, ultraportables vs 15 inch models, trying to decide Sorry for the pseudo double-post since I also posted on Suggest-a-Laptop, but in this case I have three laptops that I've researched fairly extensively and want opinions regarding them specifically more so than a person sending me a link of laptops meeting my \"form\" specification.\n\n\\* \\*\\*Total budget and country of purchase:\\*\\*\n\nUSA.

Not required for the ultrabook, say, if I got another thin-and-light computer with Thunderbolt connectivity for an eGPU.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\\*\\*\n\n\\-Portability: Ideally portable. Razer Blade 15 is about as heavy as I'm interested in.\n\n\\-Touch: Absolutely need touch-screen. As stated above.\n\n\\-Build quality: I've had some problems with recent computers, so I'm not sold on the idea that one company or another is or isn't great. My IBM Thinkpad after about 5 years of life had issues with overheating despite new thermal paste application (but probably lasted the longest). The Lenovo was never reliable. I switched to the Surface Pro... which was pretty great except for the charging adapter being absolutely terrible and not registering (which I noted with other users as well), and after getting a replacement that worked for some time... it also stopped working very well, and by then I'd run out of memory and wanted something with more I/O... so the Razer Blade Stealth had the expected issue of not registering the battery appropriately, and on day one I had to download a BIOS update (known issue I had seen in one of the reviews when I purchased the computer). I needed to send it in for an RMA due to constant freeze/buzzing issues (they told me they eventually replaced the motherboard). Recently it's been acting up making a loud crackling/buzzing noise (no freezing, not coil whine) that's probably related to the fan, but can go weeks at a time without issue... that's made me reticent to bring my poor computer out in public... Basically I've had a bad experience with Razer, but then again, I've not had the best experience with Microsoft or Lenovo either. Hopefully just bad luck, and the next computer will be a bit luckier...\n\n\\-Ports: I need Thunderbolt since I want the option for an eGPU or a Thunderbolt dock. In the past I've tried a regular USB dock with past computers, and there was too much lag to make it useful. I also want more ports than what Microsoft is offering with any of their new offerings. If they had come up with a Surface Book 3 with updated hardware, I would have been interested. At minimum, I don't want to lose ports (currently USB-C + 2x USB-A and HDMI). XPS 2 in 1 feels ridiculous. One charging USB-C, and one to plug things into. XPS 13 laptop is essentially a step backwards with one USB-C used for charging, one to replace HDMI, would then leave me with one fewer USB port available. Probably fine to get a dock, giving me two USB ports. Spectre 13 similarly loses me a USB port if I didn't have a dock. The new RBS keeps ports, but has other drawbacks. The alternative is getting a 15\" model but losing portability in favor of power and ports.\n\n\\-Memory: I need at least 512GB, preferably NVMe SSD. Would like 16GB+ for RAM, especially for the 13\" models as RAM is usually not upgradeable.\n\n\\-Display: My perfect laptop doesn't exist. If I get a 13\", I don't need to sacrifice battery for 4k since I can't tell the difference anyway, but the only touch options at this size seem to be 4k displays. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\\*\\*\n\nI THINK I've narrowed my list down to two categories, and three options within each (Razer, HP Spectre x360, or Dell XPS):\n\n1. Ultra-portable with plan for a secondary Thunderbolt dock or eGPU\n2. 15\" that still maintains some portability.\n\nUltra-portable:\n\n1. Razer Blade Stealth late 2019:\n   1. Don't lose any ports, maintain a light form factor with improvement in bezels, and actually increased power that would still allow \"light\" gaming.\n   2. The GTX1650 is fine... but comes at the cost of 15w for the CPU, basically throttling the CPU in favor of having a decent GPU. I'm not sure the extra price is worth what really isn't a gaming machine. (Comes in at $1900)\n   3. Honestly would be happy to get an Iris Plus Graphics model, would LOVE Mercury White... but those options are either NOT touch-screen or not 512GB for the SSD. Cheapest touch option (if I am understanding the Razer site) is an MX150 with 8th gen CPU and 4k panel for $1700, and it just doesn't seem to make sense to pay so much for an \"older\" model with a weaker GPU, though true it is an actual dedicated GPU.\n   4. Doesn't have microSD (though I haven't felt like I \"needed\" it as long as I have enough local memory and cloud options).\n2. Dell XPS 13 or XPS 13 2-in-1\n   1. Minimal ports. Boo. But could dock it.\n   2. XPS 13 has the \"other\" Intel 10th gen CPU, so maybe not as optimized for minor graphics/AI? However, it is 6-core, so maybe more powerful. The 2-in-1 uses Iris Plus but is even MORE limited in ports. I am fine with a touch laptop, but if equally viable, I'd go for one that can do full double duty as a hybrid. Again, supposing I use a dock, the port issue is fine? This all assumes that Thunderbolt docks work reasonably well without the lag I've experienced with \"regular\" USB docks.\n   3. XPS 2-in-1 seems to have a non-4k option, which might save some battery life and price.\n   4. Quality control issues?\n3. HP Spectre x360 13, late 2019\n   1. This is what I'm leaning toward. Also lose a port (like the XPS 13), but better than the XPS 2-in-1 and in a similar form factor, with a sleek almost bezel-less design. Would have to dock. Coming in at $1500, so pretty much the cheapest option (or about tied with the XPS13).\n   2. Comes with a pen! lol\n   3. I am having trouble determining if the CPU has 15w or 25w (Iris Plus version of 10th gen). Also not sure if the SSD is NVMe?\n   4. Like the others, only 4k options, though people seem to like the screen, and if the non-touch can reach 22hours (company testing conditions), then the OLED should probably still have reasonable battery life.\n   5. Quality control issues?\n\n15\"\n\n1. Razer Blade 15\n   1. As much as I want one of these, I can't really justify paying $3100 for the cheapest touch option. Unless there's some non-4k, or non-GTX2080 configuration I can get, anything reasonably priced is non-touch. I don't need a fantastic video card, but in the 15\" model, I do want a usable GPU. The reasonably priced ($1700-1800 options) have GTX1060Ti or 2060, but sadly no touch screen. Even with older models.\n   2. Anyone see a perfect Blade out there?\n2. HP Spectre x360 15\n   1. As much as I like the 13 inch model, I haven't really seen any reviews online for the new 15 inch model.\n   2. This is the only 2-in-1 15\" option I'm currently looking at.\n   3. $1700 (or possibly $1530 with discounts), this is the cheapest 15\" model I see among those I'm looking at most closely. However, the GPU seems to be sacrificed, with MX250 as the option.\n3. Dell XPS 15\n   1. This is probably the one I would lean toward. For $2k I could get 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD, lots of ports, GTX1650, touch, on a 6-core 9th gen CPU.\n\nSo basically looking at any experiences people have had with any of the above options. Would love to hear how the new Spectre is working out, if you found a better Razer configuration, if you've had QC issues with Dell or HP or Razer, what you might lean toward. I'm also open to other ideas (I haven't looked too deeply at the Lenovo Yoga models, for instance). I love the Surface lineup in general, but I feel like I'm probably getting more for my money with these options... though it would be nice to have an actual brick-and-mortar option for when any problems arise. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this!",

  "[Buying Help] Deciding on a Laptop in the $500 to $800 Range - 3 choices - USA I'm looking to buy a low-mid range laptop to use primarily for programming and light image editing (GIMP, Photoshop). A nice-to-have, but not necessary, is light gaming capability (CSGO, PUBG, 30+FPS on low).  \n\nMy budget is roughly $500 to $800. I could go up to $850 if necessary but don't want to go above that.  \n\nHere are my requirements & preferences when it comes to features.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Laptop must stay in one piece. I don't want a tablet with a flimsy keyboard.\n* RAM of 8GB+\n* Must have SSD hard drive\n\nPreferences:\n\n* Screen (8/10) - would strongly prefer a decent FHD IPS with 1920x1080 resolution\n* Screen Size (3/10) - Don't mind smaller screen\n* Keyboard (8/10) - I do a lot of typing and would like a decent keyboard. Backlit keyboard is a nice-to-have but not necessary.\n* Battery Life (6/10) - Should last longer than 6 hrs surfing the web or basic applications\n* Processor (7/10) - Moderate preference towards 8th gen Intel\n* Hard Drive (6/10) - preference towards 256GB+ SSD\n* Ports (4/10) - At least 1 USB 3.0. Nice-to-haves are USB C, Full SD, and HDMI ports. Finger print \nreader and optical drive don't matter.\n* Build Quality (6/10)\n* Design (5/10)\n* Thin/Lightweight (3/10) - Don't care too much about form factor\n* OS (2/10) - slight preference towards Windows, but I may end up wiping and putting Linux on instead\n* Touch Screen (3/10) - not necessary\n* Noise (4/10) - doesn't bother me much  \n\n\nI've done some research already and have converged on 3 options:\n\n1. Acer Swift 3 (i5-8250U, MX150) - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-i5-8250U-NVIDIA-GeForce-SF314-52G-55WQ/dp/B0746P25QX/) (not affiliate) - Current Price = $750 - [Notebook Check](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Acer-Swift-3-SF315-8250U-MX150-FHD-Laptop-Review.258594.0.html) - I like almost everything about this laptop except the display. The screen is quite dark and the color range could be better.\n\n2. Acer Aspire E 15 (i5-8250U, MX150) - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Aspire-i5-8250U-GeForce-E5-576G-5762/dp/B075FLBJV7/) (not affiliate) - Current Price = $599 - [Notebook Check](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-i5-7200U-GTX-950M-Notebook-Review.178326.0.html) (not exact model) - Another good spec laptop but the screen here shares many of the problems with the Acer Swift 3.\n\n3. ASUS ZenBook UX33UA-AH55 (i5-8250U, Intel Graphics 620) - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Slim-13-3-inch-Fingerprint-Anti-Glare-UX330UA-AH55/dp/B075N1YHVK/) (not affiliate) - Current Price = $749 - \n[Notebook Check](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ZenBook-13-UX331UN-i7-8550U-MX150-Laptop-Review.277586.0.html) - This is an all around good laptop. The specs are decent except for the Intel graphics. The screen is pretty good overall. One minor disappointment is that the keyboard apparently bends in the middle when typing.  \n\n\nI'm leaning towards the ASUS ZenBook. While it would be nice to see something similar with dedicated graphics, this isn't really a deal breaker for me. The other two options have great specs but I can't get past the dim screen. I've had laptops in the past with bad screens and it annoys me to no end.\n\nLet me know what you guys think. I am no expert when it comes to laptops so let me know if there is another option that fits my criteria better.",

  "Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Gen 6: First impressions I purchased the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G6, model 21NQCTO1WWBR1 on July 2025 and would like to make my impressions about this product:\n\nDESIGN AND BUILD: We don't have much to comment on the design, as it's quite minimalist. We're surprised that not all the keyboard keys follow Lenovo's signature layout, as is typical on IdeaPads, but at least the Ctrl and Fn keys are in their traditional positions, unlike ThinkPads. The light color isn't bad, but it's a shame there wasn't a darker color option (not black, which is typically only seen on ThinkPads, but a darker gray would have been nice). The touchpad is a good size. We found the number of ports interesting, but the Ethernet port's position wasn't particularly helpful, being on the right side. It's interesting that it also has an SD card reader. The number of LEDs also caught our attention, with one next to each USB-C port, in addition to the power button itself (which we really like being separate from the keyboard). We liked the backlit keyboard and the dedicated \"?\", \"/\", \"°\", and \"Menu\" keys, although they sacrificed one of the Ctrl keys. At least it didn't come with the \"Copilot\" shortcut. We didn't really like the notch in the webcam area and found it a rather questionable design decision, but we understand its usefulness. We also liked that it came without those infamous labels on the palm rest, just the Intel seal.\n\nSCREEN: We liked the quality of the IPS, but we were disappointed that the screen had excessive IPS Glow at the bottom edge, quite visible with the screen on a black background even in bright light. My brother was okay with it, but I didn't like this defect at all, which I'm already accepting is quite common in current LCD screens, as I've also seen notebooks and even smartphones and tablets from other brands with this issue. It shouldn't happen, but we've come to understand that IPS Glow is now part of the experience of having an IPS LCD screen, which is unfortunate. At least we like the thin bezels.\n\nSOUND AND WEBCAM: Neither impressed in any aspect, but neither disappointed.\n\nBATTERY AND CHARGING: The USB-C charger is interesting. My brother tested it by playing YouTube videos in 1080p with maximum brightness, and it lasted over 5 hours unplugged. For a 60Wh battery, it's an okay battery, but it could be better.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND USABILITY: Regarding performance, considering its specifications, I consider it okay. It worked very well even for running virtual machines via VirtualBox. We didn't notice excessive heat on the keyboard when heavily loaded. My brother installed the Big Linux distro, and in testing, it has worked well, including mirroring the laptop screen to our Smart TV wirelessly. My brother was unable to get BlissOS, based on Android 13, to work, as it didn't recognize Wi-Fi, but emulating Android on Big Linux with WayDroid has worked well most of the time.\n\n**Have you also purchased a Lenovo ThinkBook?

I use it mainly for college stuff, and it can handle an entire day of coding, browsing the internet and even playing some light games (such as Horizon Chase). \n\nBattery life on it is quite impressive on linux. I get 6-8h of usage with it. That's more than i get with Windows (i have no idea why i just get 3-5 hours on Windows), but i've seen some minor compatibility issues on linux, such as the mute key not lighting up or the volume keys getting \"sticky\" (if i hold it a little bit, it goes to max volume or 0), but overall, the laptop is very usable.\n\nI plan to upgrade to 16gb soon, because on my use case, 8gb is too low, especially when i get 16 tabs open for research + some niche software from 10 years and VScode.\n\nOBS: Você é o CAVBR do fórum Adrenaline, não é?",

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Asus Vivobook 15 (X1504) 12th gen i3 review Hi everyone, \n\nI'm planning to buy the Asus Vivobook 15 (X1504) 12th gen i3. As a student, performance wise, I don’t need more than that. \n\nI will mainly use it for daily tasks, researchs, and study purposes. Nothing heavey.\n\nBut I am not sure if vivobook is promising nowadays. Is there anyone using this for long time? And also the information about battery coverage. And will it last long? \n\nThank you ",
  "I’ve been using a similar Vivobook 15 with a Ryzen 7520 CPU for about 2 years now and so far it’s been working perfectly. Battery wise it lasts about 4 hours in Balanced battery mode but I’ve only charged it to 80% (that’s the default battery life extending feature). It’s pretty fragile though so you have to be careful not to drop it. Overall, I’d recommend it",
  "Thank you. Did you face any issues overall?",
  "Not really, a few times the wi-fi module failed to work after rebooting but it was easy to fix by doing one more reboot. Other than that it’s been providing solid performance \nAlso, mine had 16 Gb of RAM but if 8is enough for you, go for it",
  "Thank you so much.! Yeah I'll go for 8 GB. Thanks again",
  "Did you purchased it?",
  "I did. Couldn’t find that model.(stock out) I bought the ASUS Vivobook 15 F1504Za-NJ1615 instead. It's missing the backlit keyboard",
  "How many of you think that a 2nd gen i7 (late 2011 MacBook Pro) is good enough for you? Tbh, if I had known what I know now I would have never even bought a new laptop and probably just kept using my mother's old MacBook, I don't even play games or run blender, despite also being a computer science student I never even ran into a scenario where I had to do some hard coding. I think this would have been good enough for me, how about you guys? ",
  "Yeah if basically all you do is web activities you'll be fine.\n\nI daily use a Thinkpad t540p and it works just fine for everyday stuff as well as some java coding and packettracer for school.",
  "How much code do you do? Cause thinking about buying a ThinkPad X220 its also i7 2gen",
  "Dude I thought these were USD prices I was like WTF",
  "I mean at least in around 10 months you need a new device as you can‘t upgrade a 2nd Gen to Windows 11 and Windows 10 isn‘t getting any more security updates next year.",
  "i have the desktop version of that CPU, its gonna be alright for basic use, will run hot tho",
  "Feel free to tear me to shreds if this is too basic of a take, but the only people that feel the difference in the power of computing from 2014 - 2020 are the ultra productive and gamer folk, who need... That speed and those extra cores, but the rest of us normal folk only need if anything, M.2 storage and DDR4.",
  "ZILCH! All I had to do while being on university was basic python, C and SQL, never had to do anything extra so far, but please DO NOT! Get that gen 2 unless it's a good deal, try to snatch a Gen 6 or 7.",
  "😹 Don't worry even by Egyptian standards this is still expensive, if you want anything tech in Cairo you go to the computer malls or the motherload of all computer malls El bostan.",
  "Mac OS patcher is an option, also maybe use the SSD to boot a Linux distro... Or.... Chro-",
  "btw that RAM is incompatible, ones 1.5 and one 1.35V",
  "Yeah I have a pretty serious gaming machine 13th Gen i7 and a 6950xt.\n\nAnd yeah for anything other than gaming no one needs anything more powerful than a 4th gen i5 honestly. \nExcept for efficiency gains I guess.",
  "It was a pretty good deal, and i had a desktop for muscle work, gen 2 is just for productivity and portability",
  "Oh right MacBook. Not used to Mac using Intel anymore xD \nYeah if Apple OS still gets security updates you are good to go. Or just install Linux.\nAnd I saw that ChromeOS! Can‘t hide it from me",
  "Thanks for pointing that out,  thank god I didn't buy anything yet, I'm still going to do this only much later, set a day to just sit down and put stuff in stuff.",
  "Awesome! 🦜",
  "you need both sticks to be 1.5V iirc, also.. please buy a matching pair",
  "I will, just trying to draw a picture of what the specs will be upgraded too.",
  "i see, also if you use the ODD just buy a 1TB SSD instead",
  "But is 1TB worth it? I'm thinking about cheaping out on this one a little.",
  "why do you get the caddy for the ODD and a external one? (ODD is the DVD drive)",
  "Planning to keep the HDD and cut the optical man.",
  "why do you get a external optical?",
  "cant find any reviews/info on this ASPIRE 3 I5-1235 16G 512G 15.6 FHD SILV Bought this laptop after comparing the specs woth what im looking for, although i cannot find ANY reviews on the 16gb version.

  "im using 7530u variant for last 1 year, u can go for it. put a cloth when closing the lid, otherwise keys will have contact with the display.",
  "Ryzen 5 7430U should be around or less than 400 USD",
  "Cannot say something to this configuration but we had around 15 intel and amd based g6's in my company. Great devices except for one thing, around half of the devices had problems with the integrated webcam. Some of them in the first months, some of them after several months. The case was that that the system was loosing the physical connection to the webcam module again and again. ",
  "What about Ryzen 3 7335u version ? Thinkbook 16 g7 , I will be using it for coding and study related (cs student)\nOr should I opt with Ryzen 5 version?\nBudget is tight so can only go with Ryzen 3\nCan you suggest me if Ryzen 3 would work or else I should go with Ryzen 5 ?",
  "This is cheapest one I could find in the entire country.",
  "    As far as I remember, Asus Vivobook Go OLED with this processor was available for around INR 35,000 (USD 408) last year.",

  "Nice laptop",
  "Not sure how long it could be. It depends on what type for stuff you'll be doing.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 7355HS is actually a high power CPU and you will get less battery life \n\nThe Ryzen 3 7335U will give good battery life.",
  "Just Office apps, browser and streaming/watching on VLC. If it's more than 8-9 hours i'll be happy.",
  "Then this laptop is perfect for you. The U processor is low power but will still perform well for the stuff you will be doing. The processor is quite efficient and you get a big battery. It's likely you will get good battery life.",
  "Thanks. How many hours do you get from your vivobook?",
  "I have a medium power CPU, but it can still pull lots of power, and on top of that, an OLED screen, which also takes a lot of battery. My work involves me using multiple browsers and different software occasionally. I get between 3½-5 hours. The sad thing is that my Vivobook has a 50WH battery. Some other models have like 70 or 75WH.",
  "I was looking at few Asus laptops & found this [Expertbook P5](https://dl.flipkart.com/s/nDfvtfNNNN). Well i can afford it but i'm not sure i could get enough battery backup bcz of it's top-of-the-line screen, Ultra Core 5 226V & Intel Arc integrated from its 63whr 3 cell battery. I think it's a bit overkill for me.",
  "Nah. This Lenovo is an excellent choice. The expert book is focused on business customers. I wouldn't touch that.",
  "And don't fall for marketing tactics. If you look at the tech specs, the screen for this is a cheap IPS 400 nits screen.",
  "Ok got it 👍🏾",

  "Asus Vivobook S16 OLED (S5606CA) or wait for Lenovo ThinkPad T16 Gen 4? Hey folks, I’m torn between getting the **Asus Vivobook S16 OLED (S5606CA)** now or waiting for the **Lenovo ThinkPad T16 Gen 4**.\n\nI’ll mainly use it for work — I run a company (SemioDigital), and I’m a sysadmin with a focus on Linux and cybersecurity. I’ll also do some light content creation on the side.\n\nThe **Vivobook** is tempting: for the price, you get a latest-gen i7, solid performance, light chassis, good battery, and that OLED screen is just gorgeous… but glossy.\n\nOn the other hand, the **ThinkPad** is a business classic — more rugged, easier to service, has a matte display (less pretty but more practical), and overall better for long-term use. The downside is that it’s heavier, the current screen isn’t great (compared to the oled), and I’d have to wait for the Gen 4 to match the Vivobook’s specs — at a higher price.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar dilemma? Thoughts?",
  "Why not the vivo book with the HX370?",
  "I've briefly had vivobook with hx370 - mediatek wifi was basically unusable ( newest firmware, newest kernel on ubuntu). So what i've done is configured a environemnt and that's it - but seemed to work great other than that wifi issue, and some random internet guy have said that havent got the same issue as mine.  \n  \nNow i'm rocking intel core ultra 255h version of that vivobook, and it has some weird performance issues - something like it would be heavily bottlenecked with storage? Or maybe sometimes it let's those ultra efficient cores to work on something? Not sure, \"wait\" in top rises, nothing is happening when it should be launching an app.  \nIt does work slower under linux when it comes to blender. Some blender operations do impact whole system, and it can freeze.\n\nIt is maybe because of some drivers are not ready yet?\n\nGlossy screen in great indoors, somewhat useable outside - especially in shadowed area.\n\nIt gives me about 6hours of battery under linux, while doing some light coding. Not great, but kindof enough for me.  \nIt does throttle heavily while charging(sic!) - something is triggering PROCHOT. So no real work while it's charging :|\n\nI've tested it under ubuntu 25, with linux 6.14.\n\nTomorrow is last day that i can return it, and i think that i will - this experience is not as good as price was high.",

The other one can only fit single-sided sticks since the bottom of the socket has a piece of metal that connects directly to the cooling system to actively help cooling the NVME.

No reviews of this model.\n\n**Yoga Slim 7i 15\" Gen 9**\n\nPros: Ips screen that does not have problems with either burn in or PWM and perhaps it reflects less light (but I'm not sure about this). A lot of enthusiastic review.  \n  \nCons: Slightly larger dimensions. I don't need a touch screen. Lower quality of blacks compared to OLED screen.\n\nDo you know if the 2 battery chargers are the same size for both models?

Depends a lot on the major youre doing. I would highly recommend an iPad if you are gonna get something without a touchscreen and pencil support tho. I personally run a laptop and ipad combo, but my girlfriend just has the Yoga which is more convenient in many ways. Hope it helps.",
  "Go for an amd laptop surely. Intel core naming scheme sucks, you get an i7, you're getting a beefy i3 with the same 4c/8t if you stick to the U series from intel. Better laptops processors come from the H series from intel or Ryzen U series. Search for a laptop with intel 12450H or ryzen 5600U, you will not regret that. If you can spend a little more go for a newer laptop probably marketed as AI PC with something like intel Lunar Lake or AMD strix halo. They have insane performance while keeping the power consumption at incredibly low values with days long battery life",
  "Dell 5420 and 5520 is my preferred, just because I'm a Dell guy. Parts are cheap and available, service manuals are available, and the CPU is a good spec with years of support left. \n\nNo issues getting that 5420.",

  "yoga series laptops can have power button issues that can be a pain in the ass to fix, at least they used to a couple of years ago, not sure if anything got changed by now.\n\nanyway, careful with yoga models that have power buttons on the side, other than that, i agree with the commenter above",
  "Don't. Unless budget is an issue, an i7 will be better for longer. Do you \"need\" an i7? No. Will an i7 still have life when an i5 is struggling? Yes. \n\nWith new CPU's being absolute core-monsters, expect apps like excel to start needing more and more cores. i7's typically offer this.",
  "What country are you in? I feel like there are much better options out there. That cpu is very slow in today's standards.",
  "Surface models are better than before, but still harder and pricier to repair than ThinkPads. T/X series are much easier for upgrades and long-term use",
  "I think it's a mistype cuz those laptops are a bit small for a hdd",
  "Any of those should be fine. Generally speaking, I prefer Lenovo to dell. You don’t need 32gb ram for those uses. But, might as well get 512 over 256. Good luck!!",
  "In that case, for the purpose of battery life, I'd really consider an M1 Macbook Air. You can get them off Walmart for like $500. You get less RAM, and that's a bummer, but you won't need it for word processing. But the insane 15+ hr battery life is super useful for students.",
  "It's still using windows, it is also terrible hardware wise.",
  "Dell’s higher end laptop line",
  "550",
  "The company who design the CPUs  \nCPUs are the brain of the computer but the thing with Intel, they usually use more power to get their performance, instead of using as little power as possible to get high performance like AMD/Ryzen  \nOr Apple",
  "well it's probably their only laptop",
  "I second his thoughts either the 5420 or 5520 are the best options here, especially for a school device that will be used and abused in a backpack.\n\nOnly thing I'm curious about is why its so expensive? These things go refurbed on eBay for $250-$350 all day long.",
  "Are the prices in usd?",
  "I’ll second macbooks if you’re planning to code in school. MacOS is significantly more convenient for coding than windows laptops unless you plan to install linux. \n\nMacbooks also have significantly better battery life, so you almost never have to carry your charging cable. Furthermore, the fans almost never spin up and it remains pretty cold and silent. For those reasons, macbooks are often recommended as one of the best purposes for school. I always prefer a silent and cold laptop that doesn’t require charging over a loud and warm laptop that constantly needs to be plugged in.\n\nHowever, if you need to install windows-only programs or plan to play games on your laptop, a macbook will be a terrible choice.",
  "Unless the laptop fully folds into tablet mode and you don't already have a tablet, touchscreen laptops are mostly useless.  So many people pay for hardware/features they aren't even going to use even a quarter of the time.  I don't see how a paralegal student would benefit from touchscreen.",
  "Last I checked word doesn't need an i5 even",
  "You are right about that.",
  "Then he must have gone for a rtx gpu instead of a touch laptop. I mean did you even check the options.",
  "I5 is the best for regular use. I7 has more cores and threads, so good for multitasking. Something one doesn't need for school. If you can afford an i7 I'd suggest go for an i5 with better hardware.\n\nDon't touch a laptop with an HDD and no SSD. Always go for an SSD. 512 should be fine for daily use unless you gonna be gaming (better get a good gpu if you have gaming in mind tho, those won't cut it). You can always store your extra movies and photos etc on an external hard disk if need be.\n\nIt won't hurt to have an LED screen instead of an LCD (not LED back lit LCD, that's just a fancy LCD). That depends on your budget.\n\nA 16GB RAM is more than enough. 32 is an overkill.\n\n\nI owned a touch Asus vivo book. The screen didn't last more than 3 years (it started showing symptoms with a year of use). Replaced it with my extended warranty and it gave out after 2 years. I just use my Wacom tablet for taking handwritten notes now, still going strong with more than 5 years of use (not easy to draw with tho, cause it is of the screenless variety) . So out of personal experience I won't recommend a touch laptop. But I've heard surface laptops are good in that aspect. I request someone else to share more insight on this matter. \n\nIt'd help to let us know what exactly you expect form a laptop. Like what's your use case.\n\n\nEdit: now that I look into it, those i7's are pretty.... Low range. I'd suggest you get better ones :)",
  "If you have the money, buying a better laptop is usually better. I'm retiring mine this week after 10 years of use (because the hinges self destroyed with time, the battery is dead, the touchscreen is buggy... ...but it still worked well as a desktop computer with the additional monitor, for web browsing and watching media)",
  "With the laptop versions of the 10th and 11th generation Core CPUs, the differences between the i5 and the i7 are very minor, especially at the level you're looking at. The i7s are clocked a little higher and have more cache, but they come with the same number of cores and threads and the instruction per cycle count are very similar. There won't be much difference in performance between the two.\n\nQuite simply, get the i7 over the i5 if the cost is similar or the same but don't make it the priority.",
  "Yes I have a broken yoga right now :(",
  "Core i7-1185G7 and i5-1155G7 both are 4C/8T CPUs. The only difference between the two is that the i7's base speed is 3GHz, while the i5's is 2.5GHz. It can also boost to 4.8GHz instead of 4.5GHz. The i7 has 12MB cache as opposed to 8MB. There are differences between the two CPUs, but they're minor. For most people, the noticeable difference between the two CPUs are virtually non-existent.",
  "No budget isn't an issue and from what I've seen, they seem to be around the same price. I'd prefer to get the best I can get for what I'm willing to spend.",
  ">Will an i7 still have life when an i5 is struggling? Yes.\n\nI don't think the difference between an i7 and an i5 in the same generation is *that* large - could you give an example of where it would (have) be(en)? if the i7 in that example still has life, it'd very minimal.",
  "Going by i5 vs i7 not a good idea. An i5-1135g7 would easily beat an i7-10610u in basically every aspect.",
  "Why would excel start to require more cores",
  "For all of them? I live in Ontario, Canada. I'm only looking at refurbished.",
  "Okay thank you, I honestly didn't know any of that",
  "My point still stands.\nPlenty of external storage is available cheaply should you require it, but most people don’t get anywhere near unless they never back up their data",
  "In USD? Because I'm in Canada",
  "No these are all in CAD",
  "I use the feature, like it, and it doesn't seem to cost more. What's wrong with getting a touchscreen?",
  "Touchscreens on laptops are a requirement for me and I never use them in tablet mode. \n\nIt’s so much easier to touch the screen while on the go than using the stupid trackpad. ",
  "So that's why I'm asking this subreddit, because I'm not knowledge. You don't need to be sassy about it.",
  "Yeah but those look like gaming laptops so it's too obvious",
  "I've a gaming laptop that runs on i5 and it is doing pretty well. I7 is just an overkill. I7 doesn't mean better. It's jsut more powerful. If he has a limited budget he could use that money for a laptop with say an led or a better battery. Not an i7\n\nEdit: those i7's in the pic are e-waste tho",
  "Yeah I looked at the ones with an i5 and it seems like the cost is basically the same",
  "It seems like it's been this way almost always. I remember with the 5th and 6th generations, they were both two cores/four threads and even now with the 13th gen they are both ten cores/twelve threads, the i7 just has slightly better graphics and a higher boost clock, even the cache is now at 12 MB for both. I compared the i5 1335U on my machine with the i7 1355U and they are similar. Obviously P or H processors are even more powerful",
  "Fair point. I forgot it got weird in that generation lol",
  "Good attitude to take. Make sure these units have a bit of warranty too. I’m guessing this is USD or CAD currency?",
  "Sure, mostly in places where theres a big core count difference (and  a low amount of cores). This was more in the 7th Gen and older days, but many i5's had half the cores as their i7 big brothers\n\nAs we move to i5's with 14 cores, its less of an issue though. 14 Cores is largely seen as \"Enough\". Most people don't need a 20 Core i7 or a 24 Core i9",
  "I didn't even see those U-Class here, good catch!! U Class is basically a tablet processor lol",
  "Have you seen GPU Acceleration in Excel? Excel can be amazingly heavy at times lol",
  "To a fellow Ontarian - buy a ThinkPad, don't waste your time with dell etc., you won't regret.  Dells are not solid machines.  They're borderline consumer units with a paint coat to pretend they're business class.  Surface is literally consumer grade like mac.  They don't last long.  Thinkpads last forever, and are an absolute pleasure to work on.  For many reasons, most of which you can only appreciate once you've experienced them.  A used ThinkPad is still a thinkpad.  One of mine is 19yrs old and I still use it.  A used Dell/surface is an aging pile of parts ready to fall apart.\n\nYogas have shitty cooling but nice for writing notes with a built in stylus.  P series are beefed up versions of T's with often desktop processors.  Need more juice than T's, heavier, less battery. T14s feels nicer than T14 but less upgradeability.  The rest is up to you.",
  "Ah these are in cad. They're fine then.\n\nBtw, many refurbished laptops are just used laptops but wiped and cleaned. Not deep cleaned. Refurbished is kind of a scam 90% of the time. The only really good refurbished electronics are when they directly come from the manufacturer. But those tend to be pricey.\n\nSo, I'd just get a normal used laptop that's in good condition. Many people baby their electronics.",
  "No problem  \nMake sure to get at least 16gb of RAM, windows alone takes at least 6gb of RAM normally so anything below 16gb isn't enough these days\n\nBut if you're doing heavy creative work, you'll definitely want 32gb of RAM  \nIn that case, the Thinkpad p15 gen 2 is the only one that comes with 32gb pre-installed\n\nThough, all of them have below 1TB of storage, not sure if that's a problem but it's something worth to point out",

  "Fair enough. If the cost difference is negligible then by all means go for the i7.",
  "Mobile CPUs have *always* been weird. For a long time, the mobile i7s were still dual core while the desktop CPUs *with the same damn model numbers* were quads. I think Intel hate their customers.",
  "Yes it's in CAD",

  "Hello Fellow Caunuk! There are Canadian sellers on ebay with this model and specs for 350ish if you're looking to save a few bucks, and they're freshly refurbished with warranty.",
  "The comment above yours about the refurbs is valid, especially for this scenario. These \"wholesalers\" get these laptops as part of a recollection from businesses when their lease ends. Either they are paid to haul them away or pay pennies on the dollar for them. Their main concern is making them look good cosmetically and wipe and reload Windows. What sort of warranty are they providing with the device? Keep in mind these devices are all 4-5 years old at minimum, so your likely life span is a year or 2 max. If it's just for school and you are good replacing in a year or 2, then these should be good for that. If you want longevity, I would look for something new and I would recommend looking into AMD over Intel.",
  "You’ve just gotta use your eyes. Make sure it’s from a reputable seller, or at the very least returns are accepted. And these business laptops are usually in good condition, even when pre-owned. I’ve bought a few used Latitudes off of eBay and never had an issue beyond what is stated in the description. \n\nAnd if you’re willing, you could save a bit of money by buying an “incomplete” laptop ([Example](https://www.ebay.com/itm/177104248802)) and installing the components yourself. I’ve also done this and it can come out significantly cheaper (AKA 210 CAD for a 5420). ",
  "eBay has excellent protections for the buyers nowadays :) I wouldn't think twice from a reputable seller. \n\nPLEASE make sure to buy from a Canadian reseller to avoid Canada's tarrifs on US goods. (I've heard of them getting slapped on used goods, its just not worth it to risk it)",
