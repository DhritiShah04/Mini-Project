  "Any reviews/experience for the ThinkPad E14 G7 with Intel Ultra 7 258v CPU? I could only find reviews for the version with the 255U, because that version launched first.\nI'm mainly interested in it's battery life, because I'm looking for a laptop with decent performance and long battery life. \nNeeds to be x86 (want to dual boot Linux), so I've been looking at the Lunar Lake chips. Because Ram is soldered I'm going for 32 GB.\nThe other laptops I'm considering (Asus Zenbook, Vivobook 14, Lenovo Yoga slim 7, Acer Swift ai 14) all have glossy screens, the E14 G7 seems to be the only one in my price range (<1500€) with a matte screen.

  "its just gonna be maybe an hour less i dont think battery life is that deep of an issue",
  "I have a 268v cpu in my laptop and it is pretty slow compared to my desktop cpu. You would be better of getting an AMD HX 370 or 395.",
  "Did you buy the laptop OP?",
  "Yeah, I'm almost certain it will be fine, I just don't like the idea of buying a laptop without seeing at least one review of the specific model. Will probably buy it because spec wise it fits my needs the best",
  "Yeah, I bought it, I'm quite satisfied, mainly with the battery life. I haven't stress tested the performance, because so far I've mostly used it for office type work.\nDo you have a specific question about it?",
  "Cool",
  "Great, yes I wonder about fan noise. I would like a TP but with recent new CPU's I worry some of them get hot under load. I also would use it mostly for office work though.\n\nWhen doing basic task, does the fan turn on often, if so, is it audible? If it turns, does it stay for long?",
  "Do you know anything about fan noise on 258V?",
  "During typical office work I'm not hearing the fan at all. The lowest fan setting is also barely audible. \nBecause the lunar lake chips are tuned to be energy efficient they don't generate a lot of heat. \n\n\nI just ran a few CPU benchmarks and found out that while running on battery there are rather strict limits on power, so even during a (admittedly short) high load, it doesn't get very hot or loud. During the entire benchmark the CPU temps never exceeded 70°C, fan on medium. \n\nIf plugged in it gets louder and hotter, in return for almost double the score in 3D Mark. And still quieter than some other laptops.\n\n\nIf its charging the fan is more likely to turn on, I'm guessing because charging also produces heat.",
  "Thanks, those user reports are very important to me, and other people sensitive to noise since revies often ommits fan behaviour. \n\nAnd what power modes did you use for the tests? I wonder if for example power saver+plugged on AC will be noisy, since you stated if plugged it gets hoter. That has obvious explanation for the new design of fast charging PSU, unfortunate in modern latops.",

  "Company Laptop Choice: HP ZBook Firefly 14 G10 vs. Lenovo ThinkPad T14 G5  **Dear Redditors,** \n\ni have now to chose between these two laptops from my company portal (for the next three years): \n\n1. **HP ZBook Firefly 14 G10** Intel Core i7-1365U 10 Core Processor \n2. **Lenovo ThinkPad T14 G5** Intel Core Ultra 7 165U 12 Core Processor\n\nI like that \"better\" display of the HP and the design much.    \nOn the other hand i see that the Lenovo processor is probably better. Have the feeling, that the HP is a 1 year older model than the lenovo model. My instinct tends to go for \"newer\" is better.\n\nI mainly use my laptop **for powerpoint and excel**.   \nWorking **much without a second screen** so appreciate nice display.   \n**Nice battery life is appreciated** (my current zbook G7 doesnt run 3 hours anymore..). \n\nI watched some reviews and read notebookcheck reviews and i am still not further with my decision. \n\n**What would you do beeing in my place?**\n\nReally **appreciate** some advice on these to models and how to approach a decision. \n\nThis is the data from my comp portal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/un0cekhyqg5e1.png?width=1085&format=png&auto=webp&s=a143d1e4879ba93d55b089ba8798b9059b839392\n\n",

Also, they DON'T have a high-pitch noise to them, like you so often read when ppl complain about their laptop fans.\n\nFor my usecase (CAD), this laptop has more than enough power.  \nAnd I'm sure, you'll have a great time too using Powerpoint + Excel. ;-)\n\njust be sure to get the 120hz screen (you'll notice the difference while scrolling), and the rtx a500 for a bit of wiggle room for the future, in case, you'll do some heavier stuff on it.",

The laptop specs that I have customized and choose are as follows:\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen™ 7 7735HS (8 Cores 16 Threads)\n* GPU: AMD Radeon™ 680M\n* RAM: 8GB upgradeable until 64GB @ DDR5-4800\n* Storage: 512GB\n* Ports:\n   * SD card reader\n   * USB-A (USB 5Gbps)\n   * Ethernet (RJ-45)\n   * Kensington® Nano Security Slot™\n   * USB-C® (USB 10Gbps), with USB PD 3.0 & DP 1.4\n   * USB-A (USB 5Gbps), Always On\n   * HDMI®\n   * USB-C® (USB4® 40Gbps), with USB PD 3.0 & DP 1.4\n   * Headphone / microphone combo jack (3.5mm)\n\nI'm planning to use this laptop for my computer science studies and continue using it afterward at my workplace as a software/network engineer. The variety of I/O ports make it suitable for long-term use, imo. And from what I heard AMD tends to use less power and less heat which makes the battery life longer compared to Intel cause I need a better battery life for long classes while maintaining a decent amount of power. I also plan to play some light games on it, definitely not AAA titles. Some of the games I have in mind are Cuphead, Cult of the Lamb, Astroneer, No Man's Sky, and Fortnite.\n\nFor some reason, I haven't found many reviews on YouTube about this laptop, which is kind of odd.

  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",

  "Dell G7 17 7700 / Intel I7 10th Gen / 16 GB RAM / GeForce RTX™ 2070 SUPER 8GB GDDR6 / 512 I had been using an HP Omen 17 gaming laptop since 2017 and decided to upgrade about a month ago.\n\nI narrowed the field down to 5 or 6 gaming laptops I found online, including ASUS, MSI, Alienware, Razer, Dell and Lenovo. Best Buy helped me narrow it down to the only one they had in stock. While Dell was not my first choice for a gaming rig, they have been making Alienware laptops since 2006.\n\nThat was my first surprise, firing up the laptop to see the keyboard change colors.... from purple to red to green and back to purple. Even better, there's Alienware command center software on it. It's very basic, mainly letting you change keyboard and the front light bar colors and adjust the cooling.\n\nA common theme in online reviews is that it gets very hot. Which it does, but so did my HP Omen. I think this is \"expected behavior\" rather than something to be alarmed about.\n\nI mostly play War Thunder and Grand Theft Auto 5. Both games perform as expected and have very highly detailed graphics.  I have no complaints about this laptop except for one: Dell put over 100 GB of stuff on the SSD (Solid State Drive). You can make a system recovery USB drive and reformat to get rid of that BLOATWARE.... but it's puzzling how Dell managed to use up 100 GB with their little \"My Dell\" stuff. The software that comes with the laptop, doesn't seem like it should be using up more than 2 or 3 GB.\n\nThere are lots of online reviews, prices, different configurations and specs. I mainly posted this so I could answer questions anyone might have that can't be found online.",
  "Any updates on the Dell G7? Has overheating  caused problems?",
  "No problems at all.  As I mentioned, my previous laptop, the 2017 HP Omen, got very hot as well. I don't think it's overheating, I think it's expected to be hot.  The Omen is almost 4 years old and still works fine except for the keyboard, the letter S quit working first due to it being a \"gaming key\". So I have an external plug in USB keyboard for the Omen.  Unexpected bonus, the power bricks for the HP and Dell can be used on either laptop.",

Concerns about Lenovo quality.\n\n[Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming](http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/gaming-laptops-desktops/inspiron-15-7000-gaming/spd/inspiron-15-7567-laptop/fncwf513h) - Dell, i5, 7th gen. good price.\n\n[Dell G7](http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-dell-g7-15/spd/g-series-15-7588-laptop/dncwfsb632s) - Gaming Dell. A little pricey. Gen 8 i7. \n\nAny other recommendations or deals would be appreciated. My budget is $600-$1000 but I would be willing to go over for the right deal.\n\n\n",
  "Dell g7 is amazingly priced. Not pricy at all, especially compared to every other new laptop on the market ",
  "Dell G7 > Dell 15 7000 > Lenovo > Acer > MSI\n\nThat's my opinion based on personal experience.",
  "I second this and its based on the 7577 that Dell had last year.  \n",
  "It seems like a good deal. How do you think it compares to the MSI laptop I listed from Costco? They are both the same price but the MSI has 16gm RAM and a 17\" screen and I would get the 4 year warranty. The g7 does have the 8th gen i7 though.",
  "Depends what you want to do. Across the board the new i7 is an improvement in gaming. How much? Less than you'd think. Some games really make use of extra cores, but they are few and far between.\n\nIf the laptop is for work, boy will you see an improvement. \n\nExtra screen real estate is nice if you need it. I do programming and fifteen inches is tough. Not impossible though, as I'm buying the Msi gs65 when it comes to Canada in May. I value quiet and light over screen real estate. That's just me.\n\nAlso if the Dell only has 8, get 16. You want 16. I know that Dell has 16, so just look for the right model. ",

  "Asus FX 504 has bad thermals I think. Techtablets did a review on it and he wasn't too happy. ",
  "Had a look at the Zenbook 15 or Zenbook Pro 15? They have good colour space coverage and look pretty good/non gamery while the Pro also has half decent graphics. \n\nAlso, yes you can game on a MacBook, feral interactive ports quite a few games and you can also dual boot Windows on a MacBook. You’ll get funny looks tho.",

  "HP does have a horrible custom support in my opinion... My HP laptop was broken so I sent it to the repair (HP repair centre). It took them more than 4 weeks to repair it... They changed the hole mainboard, but they downloaded a completely wrong BIOS system! So I would never buy a HP laptop again, because of this experience. I hope I don't sound too harsh... It is not really funny to miss a laptop if you need it for working. \nA good custom support is also a factor for a decision... Btw. I love the lenovo laptops !"
