  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",
  "This is why I'm planning to upgrade my X1 carbon g5 to g13. It will be expensive, but it will be worth it I hope.",
  "i have one, i love it and find it enjoyable but im not a lappy connoisseur like you ive only had desktops for last decade, i will monitor this touchpad thing and touchscreen issue, but i use a bt mouse mostly, and i dont have this glow on the screen, or not that i notice, everything else seems manageable\n\ntry one more replacement, what other options are there right now? i dont think it looks or feels cheap. i like same things as you, the usb c on both sides, i like the weight and solid feel, the shiny bright screen, speakers, fast solid bt and wifi, keyboard, low bloatware, amazing battery and playing gta v\n\nmy bt 5.3/4 can let me use my earphones all the way in the shower room which i couldnt do with my previous 5.1 or whatever, thats big life immprovement for me\n\ni feel the top function row of keys the backlight bleeds through the bottom of the row a bit much depending on angle but not a big deal",
  "This is a very interesting review. Currently not many reviews for this model. Have you got chance to try other Lunar Lake models?",
  "Nice review! Would you mind sharing how the Aura's screen compares to the SL7 you previously had? And how the fan noise in the SL7 was for you in the same setup you mentioned with external monitor?",
  "Thanks for this insightful review.\nRegarding the fan noise, is it possible to use tpfancontrol (or more recent) to customise it ? On both T15 (Gen 1) and L14 they work well to start the fan sooner than the firmware does, but I do not know whether it is possible to delay the fan startup...\nThanks,\nP.S. : additional question : what is the lowest rpm that tpfancontrol can achieve ?",
  "I noticed a big difference in performance after uninstalling the bloatware. Battery is great, response is snappy, touchpad is fine, not great, screen is lovely.

Best non Mac I’ve ever owned, and I think the x1 carbon will be better in terms of build quality but couldn’t see myself doubling the cost for materials and same specs. \n\nAll in all, a very solid, reliable piece of equipment.",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",
  "For me, the biggest issues so far:\n\n1. Occasional phantom touches - similar to the OP\n\n2. eGPU compatibility (GPD G1) - it used to work with meteor lake laptop which I had (YogaBook 9i).

  "  \nI have had this laptop for a week. I have updated everything that needed updating (Windows and all relevant drivers). Everything is fine except for the Wi-Fi, which is very slow. I usually connect it to my phone’s hotspot (an S23 Ultra), and when I tested it with Ookla Speedtest, the download speed never exceeded 180 kb/s (0.18 Mb/s), while the upload speed reached up to 4 Mb/s. It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do? I bought this from BestBuy in the U.S., but I’m currently not in the United States. While returning it is not impossible, it would be very difficult, and I would prefer to resolve the issue without having to return it.",

  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues.

For example, unless it's one of the newest MacBook pros, you might be used to an incredibly glossy screen that leads to a busted user experience if there are windows or uncontrolled lights nearby.\n\nMy M1 Max MacBook Pro was also incredibly laggy for things like window snapping and some other things where I couldn't get rid of the animation and you just have to wait for part of a second from time to time before you can do things.\n\nPretty amazing that it compares to a multi-thousand dollar laptop, but also multi-thousand dollar laptops these days can be pretty disgusting, or at least that has been my experience with the M1 Max, and some Windows laptops from Dell, Asus, and Framework being laggy with windows 11.\n\nMaybe it's just a software problem though and I shouldn't be comparing wildly inefficient operating systems like Mac OS and Windows 11 to things like debloated Windows 10 or Linux on a 12-year-old Thinkpad originally rated for 24 hours of battery life.",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "How do the speakers compare to the MBP?  Thx",
  "I currently have the G16 and the aura and when it comes to speaker quality, these two are pretty close. the G16 has a slightly fuller bass and slightly wider sound stage. In my opinion if the G16 are a 10, the Aura speakers are a 9.5. I also feel the browsing experience to be much better on the Aura. I experience more lag on the G16 and the fans kick on, the SOC can get too hot for the G16 to sit on the lap, even with light browsing. That being said the track pad on the G16 is better. while the keyboard on the Aura is much better",
  "I was thinking of buying this but it has way too much bass, since I listen to music a lot that's a dealbreaker for me. Also, the bass resonates across the laptop body which creates a weird sensation if you're typing while listening to music. I tried adjusting equalizer in dolby software but still couldn't get the sound right. Did you find a solution to eliminate bass (so chassis doesn't resonate) and music becomes clear?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "I just did, looks good from any angle.",
  "Thanks for your review. I finally decided not to buy this model (it's in my cart for a few days).",
  "Thanks for the insight. Where did you see others complaining about the touchpad issue? If it's not isolated to my machine I'm afraid it may be drivers / firmware.",
  "sounds like an issue with Intel ultra series 2 to be honest.  \n  \ncan anyone who has tested other series 2 intel laptops confirm?",
  "I wud return it for the annoying spinning wheel alone",
  "I wish the X1 carbon line still had good IPS panels. OLED isn't for me. P14s gen 5 has a nice 120hz 3k IPS, I might consider that one.",
  "Hey, I'm thinking of picking up this machine, but I'm curious to know how much battery life you're getting?",
  "Haven't tried any other Lunar Lake laptops as of yet. There will allegedly be a SL7 for business with Lunar Lake next year, thinking about waiting for that. Though knowing Microsoft they'll charge an arm and a leg for 32Gb.",
  "I also posted a review of SL7 a few months ago if you wanted to have a look. The SL7's display is pretty comparable to the Aura's. It had worse PPI (201 vs 222), and worse subjective calibration making it bit washed out, but didn't have the IPS glow issues of the Aura. The AR coating was also better. I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve. The chassis would get way too warm in heavier tasks and the fan would hardly do anything. But still, I prefer the SL7's acoustics. No noise in a docked setup.",
  "Cant seem to get it working on the Aura.",
  "What did you uninstall? ",
  "Which bloatware did you remove?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "Thanks for the recommendation on uninstalling the bloatware.  Any update on the laptop?",
  "It's annoyingly reflective. And it's a pitty because under the perfect conditions it's really nice to look at. But it's a laptop so conditions change and are rarely perfect",
  "Is it a problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "The low RPM noise isn’t too bad, it’s just the fact it’s there at all that irks me. It’s completely unnecessary to have such an aggressive fan curve with a Lunar lake chip inside, but I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker. \n\nThe eye strain comes from the GPU, not the glossy display surface. Same strain when docked. Seems to be recent intel GPU’s from what I’ve read, causing issues for those sensitive to dither, or whatever rendering technique it is that causes the pain.",
  "The Aura screen dimensions are compatible with the MacBook Air 15. Get a MBA 15 compatible matte screen protector, and it'll greatly reduce glare and reflections on the Aura.",
  "was this 16 or 32gb of ram?",
  "BTW, as an update to my experience, I have my touchscreen replaced as it seems to be touchscreen issue instead of touchpad. For a week, touchwood, no such touchpad issues anymore.\n\nThe only remaining gripe I have would be the lack of compatibility with my GPD G1.",
  "Have you uninstalled McAfee already? It will greatly improve system performance. The Microsoft antivirus software built in Windows is better. That's probably the first thing to do after unpacking a new Lenovo laptop.",
  "It's really subjective. Do you have any issues with other modern devices? In laptops I find Intel Xe iGPU's to be bad for eye strain, Nvidia perfectly fine, AMD tolerable but not ideal.",
  "For my ghost touches issue, turns out I went to Lenovo repair centre to have screen replaced, then as of these weeks the ghost touch issue is gone for me.",
  "how did it go? did you send it in and is it still working?",
  "Hello \n\nI am going to buy this laptop soon.\n\nIs there display glare problem a deal breaker?  \nSome people mentioned : glossy displays leading to poor battery life because you have to crank up brightness to max to combat glare.\n\nThanks",
  "Its not easy to buy a laptop nowadays. many models and there are issues on each model. No windows laptop is perfect it seems, unless you pay big amount to Thinkpad series highend one.",
  "Luckily the 15.3\" screen is the same size as the Macbook Air 15, so you could pick up a matte screen protector.",
  "[I just reviewed it](https://smbtech.au/features/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-aura-edition-laptop-review/) and got 26.5 hours. That's a new record on my site.",
  "After using for some time, I think it’s similar to surface laptop screen. It’s reflective but with decent resolution. Colors are vibrant. I mostly work inside so it’s been fine. Working outside might be slightly tough because the screen is pretty reflective (not as good coating as MacBook). If you turn up the brightness to 100% that might make it better for outside work.",
  "I think the same, if not even better.   So loud and clear and good bass too.   I've tested both the 14\" and the 15.3 and had zero issues.  I think the one this person is talking about was just a lemon",
  "Not really, I just got used to it.",
  "Barely but yes. You can be outside (in the shade of course) and make do while in light mode. It's a mirror though, so you gotta find the right angle.",
  "Thank you so much - I really appreciate it. This makes it a buy for me. ",
  "Glad I could help make that tough decision! Not many choices right now that are similar to Yoga 7i Aura Edition but hoping we get some new releases soon...",
  "I read about a couple folks mentioning unresponsive touchpad in some YouTube comments and in r/lenovo comments as well",
  "You probably don't need this anymore but its around 8 hours minimum for demanding stuff, WAY higher with regular use. Much more than one needs. If you plan on using it for several days in a row, just bring the charger.",
  "As I sit here looking at my non-upgradeable to Windows 11 Surface Book 2.  You felt and looked premium, I paid a lot for your middle tier processor, I learned what heat throttling was, sometimes you think the screen is disconnected when it isn't, we had a good run. No more MS laptops for me thanks.",
  "Just read it, some great detailed insights there. Definitely swaying me towards getting the SL7, especially given the low/no noise from the fans which is very important to me. Thanks for replying!",
  "How would you compare the screen reflectivity between the SL7 and the Aura? Still waiting for my Aura to arrive",
  "OK, thanks for trying, it is good to know that it is not compatible... by the way, there are several variants, depending on the model (eg 1 or 2 fans) : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qjlal2/tpfan_control_on_newer_thinkpads_share_your/\n\nOn the Aura, there is also a built-in BIOS configured power management, accessible through Fn+Q command : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1fufeoa/lenovo_yoga_slim_7i_aura_edition_ama/lqcjek5/",
  "What if you set the performance/fan mode to quiet? Does that make it quiet enough? I'm thinking of getting this too and have heard mixed reviews about fan noise",
  "Ya, it’s been hit or miss on battery life. Touchpad gets finicky w longer use, appears to be pretty sensitive to the oils on the skin and any grime so I try to use the mouse. I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",
  "Its actually not too bad in person (at best buy) when viewed side by side to the book 4 screen.   I think the book 5 screen has more anti-reflective coating and they did not have that model for testing.",
  "Is the reflection problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "Does anyone tried this?",
  "It had been on sales for £1100 for the Aura 258V 32GB RAM model in the UK (e.g. Lenovo Store, Currys).",
  "Yes the 32 GB version with Intel 258V. Seems like some of the discounts are now gone.",
  "I have the same ghost touch issue, sending it in for repair under warranty in 2 days.  \nhow was you experience with the repair and is it still working?  \nAsking since i have heard many bad things about Lenovo's repair service.",

  "Tell me how the type of graphics card can affect eye strain. Eye strain and other discomforts are caused by PWM and temporal dithering. These are defects or characteristics of displays, and intervening components are unlikely to be the cause, but I could be wrong. Please comment.",
  "I exchanged it",
  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast. The screen is very glossy though. if you work in a very bright room with bright background/light behind you, then yeah it can be very annoying to clearly see your reflection on the screen even at 80% brightness. it's depends see if you can find a sample in the nearest store.",
  "I like your little candy cane for scale",
  "Can you share me the settings that you have used while testing this and was there any major tweaks done to this? I got the same laptop but seems like my idle drain is little bit higher, although I did clean install of windows.",
  "Is it good?",
  "HP's new OmniBook Flip looks good, but its battery is a bit small. Maybe I'll wait for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura edition. It'll be very expensive at the release time though.",

Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",

  "The 9i looks like a nice machine especially with mini-LED, but the chassis is quite cheaply made, like the Pro 7. All plastic interior, including the hinge assembly.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully.

Hello everyone,  \nI'm looking for a new Windows/Linux machine of my own and after few days of examining the market I've narrowed down my choices into Yoga family (and peeking also at IdeaPad Pro), particularly the Yoga Pro 7 10th gen.\n\nHowever, it kinda bugs me that the 10th gen model comes with 90Hz screen compared to 120Hz screen in previous generation. I know that the new panel is generally brighter and supports HDR, yet I still don't understand why they capped it to 90Hz while other Yoga laptops come with 1100 nits peak brightness 120Hz panels.\n\nSo I wanted to know if there's anyone here that has the last-gen Yoga Pro 7 and could give me some honest review of it (and ideally compare with previous gen, but I'm asking too much).\n\nLittle context - I'm looking for laptop for software development and CAD designing. I'm keen on good display (I was also peeking the Yoga Slim 9, but I don't like the glass lid - I have small kids and that thing could get shattered in seconds :D). I've kind of ruled out the Lunar Lake laptops in favour of Ryzen 9 365 as I'm rather looking for little more performance rather than little more battery life. For that reason I'm also considering IdeaPad Pro 10th gen with Core Ultra 9 285H, but that might be a bit overkill (I also want cool and quiet system).\n\nI really need (either gentle or hard) nudge to finally decide which way to go in a budget close to 1500 EUR.

Admittedly, I’m still quite new to the world of PC’s and the intricate differences of CPU, GPU, single cores vs multi core performance etc etc.  I’m learning a lot!\n\nI was pretty convinced by the Thinkpad P16s Gen2 with the AMD processor. Whilst it has an integrated GC, the performance looks great and it’s still accredited by Dassault. I also like that the charger is USB-C. I’m also drawn to an AMD processor.\n\nHowever.

  "HP zbook firefly or Lenovo yoga slim 7.. or something else? I need to buy a new laptop because I finally had to update to windows 10  my old HP zbook (Intel i7 4600U - 8Gb ram AMD FirePro M4100) and now it is too slow and I can't use the dedicated gpu anymore because of the drivers. \nI need a laptop for data analysis, heavy multitasking, some CAD and 3d graphing of data.\nI would like a lightweight laptop, with backlit keyboard, preferably 15\" but 14\" is also ok, not glossy... \nSince I liked my old zbook I looked for HP laptops and found this one:\nHP firefly with ryzen 7 PRO 8840HS processor and 16Gb ram (upgradable). \nBut I couldn't find a lot of reviews online. \n\nIn a shop I saw the Lenovo Yoga slim 7. I liked it because it felt quite sturdy compared to the other displayed laptops, and very compact and lightweight.\nI have seen that there is a ryzen version 14\" , and also a 15\" version but only with Intel processors. Unfortunately the ram is soldered, so I don't know if I should go for 32Gb or 16 Gb are enough. \nThey cost approximately the same.  Which one is better? \nOr could I find something less expensive, in the 900-1200 range for example?\nProbably I need more the ram than a fast processor...? \nI think the modern integrated GPUs are better than the old dedicated ones so I don't think I need a dedicated gpu anymore..\n\nThanks\n",
  "For the Firefly, you can also look at reviews for HP Elitebook 845 G11.  Exactly the same machine, the ONLY difference is the BIOS.  Physically identical machines.\n\nI have a Firefly G10 A (7940HS) and an Elitebook 845 G11 (8840U) and I'm impressed with them.  I have the 2.5K 500-nit screen for both, and they're very powerful, INSANELY nice displays, with better than I would have expected battery life given the lcd.",

  "Choosing between a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro X 14 & Macbook Air M2 So I am shopping around for a laptop due to upcoming travels and I am torn between these two. The specs of each system are as follows:\n\n**Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro X 14**\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS CE / 3.3 GHz\n\nRAM: 32 GB (6400Mhz) LPDDR5 SDRAM\n\nHDD: 1 TB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 x4 - NVM Express (NVMe)\n\nDisplay: 14.5\" - IPS / 3072 x 1920 (3K) / 120 Hz /400 cd/m²\n\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 / 4 GB GDDR6 SDRAM (integrated GPU: AMD Radeon 680M)\n\n[Macbook Air M2](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/midnight-apple-m2-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-512gb)\n\nThe base version of the more expensive one:\n\n* Apple M2 chip with 8‑core CPU, 10‑core GPU, 16‑core Neural Engine\n* 8GB unified memory\n* 512GB SSD storage\n\nThe price points are roughly the same (buying in Sweden FYI) so it's all down to choosing the rig I want really.I certainly understand that I get \"more\" hardware with the Lenovo option but would like to hear what the better pick would be in your opinion and what you would consider before choosing.\n\nI never owned a laptop before, strictly a desktop guy and I am not looking to replace my desktop. I am happy if I can watch movies (Netflix & downloaded), manage 15+ tabs while browsing and play some lightweight games (like Hearthstone) while traveling, obviously I wouldn't mind playing some more demanding games but it's just a bonus. I don't do any video editing or anything like that. I would use it mostly for the things mentioned and work related tasks which is mostly trading via web browser.\n\nI can not upgrade anything on the Macbook Air version without getting outside of my budget. I would have looked at Macbook pro 14 m1 if I had US prices, alas I do not.\n\nI really like the design/look of the M2 and the fact that it has a long battery life. Since I also handle sensitive data I like that Mac inherently have less malwares going around and being developed to target them (even though that number is steadily increasing). It also feels like less of hassle when on the go, lighter, won't have to always bring a charger if I know I have a full charge when heading somewhere etc. My concern is that 8 gb of ram will be pushing it even for non heavy workload stuff (I heard conflicting things, as a PC user 8gb ram sounds like nothing in 2023 tbh) as well as being shoehorned into not ever doing anything demanding would the need arise (I really can't think of anything myself on the spot though).\n\nThe Lenovo clearly is a stronger machine (not in all, but most areas) and since I am a PC guy it's slightly more intuitive to use (I have a Macbook pro from 2015 and honestly, I never found it very confusing when I used it either). Another positive is that I can simply transfer a lot of the stuff I need from my desktop, mostly a convenience thing though. I have tried my best to find reliable reviews of the Lenovo as specced above but they are rare to find, I am concerned that the battery life would be a disappointment.\n\nI am a Android user so I won't be syncing anything with the Macbook if that is a consideration at all.\n\nAny advice or just ideas that could tip me in either directions would be great. Thanks a bunch!",

  "What did you end up with if you dont mind me asking? Are you happy with the decision?",
  "Thanks a bunch for your input. I think the price is due to Apple being significantly marked up in Sweden and there's no costco/amazon to bail us out either :< The Lenovo is a returned unit so it's marked down about 100 bucks or so which helps as well. I am def. leaning towards the Lenovo at this point.  \n\n\nEdit: I did some research, seems like the Lenovo is on sale for [1099 USD at costco](https://www.costco.com/lenovo-slim-7-pro-x-14.5%22-touchscreen-laptop---amd-ryzen-9-6900hs---geforce-rtx-3050---120hz-3072-x-1920-display---windows-11.product.100976621.html).

  "My review of Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro 5900HX, provides surprisingly good CPU performance for its slim factor. **Info:**\n&nbsp; \nThe performance is incredible for its thin form factor; read further to understand why.\nThis laptop was bought from a nordic retailer called Elgiganten\n\n\n[Retail store](https://www.elgiganten.se/product/datorer-tillbehor/barbar-dator/windows-laptops/266806/lenovo-yoga-slim-7-pro-14-barbar-dator-r9h161tb)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nHere's a pic of the laptop: \n[Pic here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/583295616470220811/856933484484362300/IMG_20210622_182621.jpg)\n \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\nThe price is pretty hefty, but this was the one with 8 cores in stock, so I went with this after waiting almost 1 year since the announcement of AMD Lenovo Yoga slim 7 Pro 2020 August.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI will be using laptops performance mode called extreme capacity and a third party software called AMD APU Tuning Utility (that allows the cpu to consume higher power in longer run) AATU for short which will be used as comparison reference to see if there's performance difference with and without AATU during benchmark.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/JamesCJ/amd-apu-tuning-utility\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinnebench 20: Extreme capacity mode:**\n\nMulti Score: 4520\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 64 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 45 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/DvmFls1.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinnebench 20: AATU:**\n\nMulti Score: 4891\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 72 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 60 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/Dw1aXon.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinebench 23: Extreme capacity mode:**\n\nSingle score: 1470\n\nMulti score: 11442\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 65 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 44 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/1GeKm4H.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinebench 23: AATU:**\n\nSingle score: 1478\n\nMulti score: 12547\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 73 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 60 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/UFIqDe8.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Geekbench 5:**\n\nhttps://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/8527380\n\nEDIT: redid the geekbench putting the laptop under ideal condition this time\n\nhttps://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/8539588\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n**Aida64 Memory Benchmark:**\n\n[Benchmark](https://i.imgur.com/ZDONu1F.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**LatencyMon:**\n\n[Result](https://i.imgur.com/qXYhvga.png)\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Keyboard and trackpad:**\n\nThe key travel is a bit short to my liking, but I get used to it eventually. Lenovo comes with FNlock in escape key, which makes it easier to disable and enable. This is still a better keyboard to type than M1 macbook, though.\n\nTrackpad is a glass surface; while it's not that good compare to macbooks, it is still pretty damn close. Very smooth and enjoyable surface to touch. \nThe trackpad has a quiet click and doesn't rattle at all. The trackpad is firm in its stationary position.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Battery:**\n\n6 hours, with 60hz enabled and using multiple battery optimization. The screen itself chugs a lot of watt due to the resolution. Considering I'm primarily at the library with power plugged in, I don't find the low battery performance an issue. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nLenovo has built an excellent cooling solution wherewith restrictions temporarily removed, and it can sustain 60 watts in such a slim form factor that provides fantastic performance. Gaming laptops with 5900hx scored 4912, while my laptop with AATU reached 4872, which is incredibly impressive considering how thin the laptop is. \nSee hardware unboxed score of 5900hx [HERE](https://youtu.be/pdO4u87UCYI?t=229)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe build quality is up there with m1, and has a premium quality feel to it. The chassis doesn't budge when twisting the base. The screen hardly wobbles, although you kind of struggle to open the lid with 1 finger. The structure rigidity in this laptop case is excellent.\nCuriously, Lenovo decided to throttle performance, capping the max temp at around 85-89 degrees celsius. Doing this prevents the cpu from consuming more watts, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. \n\nAATU bypasses Lenovo throttle restriction and allows the cpu to get a bit more hotter while still staying within acceptable temperature according to AMD. This removal allowed us to consume higher power consumption which brings us better performance. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe fans are also pretty good at idle, where its very quiet and also very good when it ramps up to faster rpm speed. It's very subtle when the fans adjust the RPM speed. \nThe laptop fans stay very quiet even when watching twitch streams in 1080p streams, which is fantastic.\n\nThis laptop came with a lenovos premium warranty service where they offer live support and send technicians to your home to fix the laptop. I've waited close to 1 year for this laptop ever since lenovo announced the 4800H version of this laptop, and I'm delighted with this laptop.",

  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",

  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Which laptop for engineering studies? Hi, I'm a 3rd year chemical engineering student who needs to buy a new laptop. I need to be able to do programming in Python and Matlab, have multiple programs open: PYmol, Chrome/DuckDuckGo, Slack, Zotero, Word, Excel, Schrödinger Maestro etc. with very often multiple tabs (minimum 10 tabs) open in Chrome/DuckDuckGo due to literature research/general learning.\n\nI'm currently doing the 3rd year/bachelor thesis, which is a literature survey and my current laptop is seriously lagging, freezing etc. I also use the laptop for taking notes during lectures, which can be up to 8h per day. So a good battery is prioritised, as well as good enough power to compile code for programming courses and some maths courses where we use Python to solve some assignments. My budget is around 17000 SEK (Swedish krona), which is equivalent to 1767 USD.\n\nI'm currently pending between these models:\n\nYoga Slim 7i Gen 9 Aura edition (15\")\n\n15 027 SEK (lenovo website), Intel Ultra 7 258v, Integrated graphics, 32GB RAM LPDDR5X 8533MT/s, 15.3\" 2.8k IPS, touchscreen, HDR 400, 100% DCI-P3, 500 nits, 120Hz, Wifi 7, 70Wh battery.\n\nYoga 7i 2-in-1 Gen 9 14\"\n\n12 779 SEK (lenovo website), Intel Ultra 7 155H, Integrated graphics, 32GB RAM LPDDR5X 7467MT/s, 1TB SSD, 14\" 2.8k OLED, touchscreen, HDR 500, 100% DCI-P3, 400 nits, 120Hz, Wifi 6, 71Wh battery, Support for pen.\n\nYoga 9 2-in-1 14\" 14IMH9\n\n15 428 SEK (online store), Intel Ultra 7 155H, Integrated graphics, 32GB RAM LPDDR5X 7467MT/s, 1TB SSD, 14\" 2.8k WQXGA+ OLED, touchscreen, HDR 500, 100% DCI-P3, 400 nits, 120Hz, Wifi 6E, 75Wh battery, Support for pen.\n\nYoga Pro 7 AI 9 14.5\" 14ASP10\n\n15 490 SEK (online store), AMD Ryzen AI 9 365, Integrated graphics Radeon 880M, 32GB RAM LPDDR5X-8000, 1TB SSD, 14.5\" 3K OLED, touchscreen, HDR 600, 100% DCI-P3, 500 nits, 90Hz, Wifi 7, 84Wh battery.\n\nI've also had a look at a Thinkpad T14s Gen 4 (15 927 SEK) which is within budget, but I've read that it has bad battery time (57Wh)...\n\nWhat should I choose? I've been reading so many reviews and can't make up my mind. I like the 2-in-1 for taking notes and anotating articles. But I can continue with writing on paper or buy a cheap tablet for that purpose.\n\nMy priority is multitasking and compiling power with low fan noise as well as lasting a full day of studying/note taking during lectures. And minimum 14\" screen.\n\nThank you in advance! Really appreciate any advice\n\n(Crossposting here and on r/lenovo)",
  "Looking for durable, long lasting, quiet, bright laptop. Doesn't have to be really performant. Good day!\n\n**===== Mandatory requirements =====**\n\n**\\* A good battery life**. So CPU+GPU isn't needed, APU should be enough. For communication, light programming, light 3D design, light music production in Ableton with not many VSTs, and similar tasks. Kind of \"a machine for a student\", I guess?\n\n**\\* A good build quality**. Probably full metal then, right? I don't want to deal with broken hinges and similar problems. I'd like to be able to throw it into my backpack and don't worry too much about breaking it (to an adequate limit, of course).\n\n**\\* A silent cooling solution**. I shouldn't hear fans at all in any tasks except heavy ones: VS+VSC in debug + browser with many tabs opened + etc.; Ableton in high quality with many VSTs. If APU is relatively weak, so it's not able to deliver high performance, but it never makes the laptop noisy too -- alright, that's fine too. It doesn't have to be the latest tech.\n\n**\\* A bright, colorful screen**. I have a bad experience with other laptops (some were older models, some were newer) loosing maximum brightness relatively rapidly. So, as for a typical no-brain consumer, my first though is to battle this with the higher maximum brightness, say 500+ nits. What, in most, but not all, cases, automatically means an OLED screen. What lies along the \"colorful\" requirement. I don't have a huge fear of burn-in, I'm using a Steam Deck OLED since launch and an OLED smartphone for a few years; but feel free to warn me if you see a need, you're welcome. IPS is fine too, but OLED is preferable. But overall, if you think that the idea of battling the problem of \"loosing maximum brightness\" with higher maximum brightness is dumb -- I'm all ears.\n\n**===== Optional requirements =====**\n\n\\* Small pleasant touches that everyone wouldn't be against having in their own laptops. Like a **comfortable keyboard** (I type a lot, like really a lot, well, you see yourself), **precise touchpad** (this would be great, to be able to finally efficiently use laptop without mouse), **nice sounding speakers**, **many ports** (especially USB-C), **fingerprint reader**, **low weight**, **fast and stable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth**, etc. Would be nice to be able to charge it with USB-C port, not DC, but probably that's already included in modern laptops, and I'm just not aware. Okayish webcam (if it doesn't have a shutter -- no problem, I'll glue it with a tape myself 😄).\n\n\\* **I have nothing against ARM** APUs (M1, M1 Pro or Snapdragon; I don't see a need in M2 and newer, but we'll see), but I don't want to be a beta-tester and especially pay for it with my own money. I don't want to have VS/NPM/VST/.NET (not .NET Core) and other more common-usage (old software) compatibility problems. May this even cost me a small(!) downgrade in price, performance, or battery life -- reliability is more valuable to me. So **x64 is preferable**. But if you have pleasant personal experience with ARM -- I'll gladly listen to your arguments, why not.\n\n\\* If the laptop doesn't suck air from the bottom (or does, but not only from there), so I **can calmly throw it on any surface including a sofa or a pillow** \\-- that'd be nice.\n\n\\* **A touchscreen, or even a transformer**. Just a nice feature in some apps, say in Internet browsing, but I can live without it. By the way, I just caught myself thinking that, on practice, transformers may actually be even more durable because of those 360-degree-rotating hinges. I wonder if that's true 🤔\n\n\\* Size? Hm... 14\" is probably alright, but I lean more towards **15\", and even 16\"**. Less portable, sure, but it's worth it. I have a moderately performant device with a small screen already -- my smartphone.\n\n\\* I think **16 GB of RAM** should be enough for a device of such performance. As for the **SSD capacity -- the more -- the better**, depending on the price. To the point of also having a quiet but big (few TBs) HDD inside as well (but that may be too old-fashined and so rarely present nowadays, I assume 😄). **I have no problem with opening a laptop** and replacing the SSD, if I feel satisfied, and I'm going to keep it. Same about adding more RAM in the future (if it's not soldered, of course).\n\n\\* **Antiglare screen coating**. Not a matte, but a slightly matte -- antiglare. After using a Steam Deck OLED 1 TB with such a screen coating I've started loving it and would like to have it here too. If can be purchased separately -- no big deal, I can purchase and apply it myself. But, probably, then better the screen be glossy, right? To not end up being too matte, after applying the external antiglare coating.\n\n\\* **If x64 then AMD APU**. I have trust issues towards Intel. But if you see them pointless -- alrighty, I can try Intel too.\n\n\\* **60+ Hz screen, preferably 120 Hz**. Yes, even OS UI animations become more pleasant to look at.\n\n**===== What about examples I've found already in this subreddit and not only =====**\n\n\\* **Macbook Pro 16\" M1 Pro 16/512 or 16/1024**. Yes, ARM, compatibility problems (potential and confirmed). But if x64 alternatives are much worse and/or much pricier -- seems like I'll have to deal with those problems then, spend personal time on relearning a lot of things (never used Mac before).\n\n\\* **Macbook Air 15\" M2 16/512 or 16/1024**. Older 13\" is way too small. And this is at the same price as a Mac Pro higher, so I don't see a point in this one.\n\n\\* **Asus Zenbook 14 OLED UM3402YA**. A lot of complaints on the noise, but an interesting variant.\n\n\\* **Lenovo Yoga 6/7, Yoga Slim 6, Yoga Pro 7, Yoga Slim 7 Pro**. Brightness looks very low (300-400 nits), but except that -- this is the closest I've found. There are complaints about noise too, but, in comparison, there seem to be not as many of them (of complaints).\n\nThank you in advance and take care of yourself 👋 Ready to answer more aiming questions if needed. Will look for it in Europe. Budget: \\~€1000 for something interesting just not performant, \\~€2000 for something both interesting and performant (Mac Pro).\n\n**===== Updates =====**\n\n1. [Asus Zenbook 14 UM3402Y](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Zenbook-14-UM3402Y-laptop-review-New-Ryzen-7-7730U-name-old-Zen-3-performance.724864.0.html)\n\n*\"Asus advertises a peak brightness of 550 nits which we can confirm only when displaying HDR content. When running* [*this HDR test*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlAsAuBtmps)*, for example, we're able to record a maximum brightness of 542 nits on our test unit. Otherwise, maximum brightness is limited to just \\~340 nits when displaying SDR content which is still in line with most IPS-based subnotebooks.\"*\n\nWTF Asus? I've been relying on this characteristic so much. Welp, at least taking this into account will now add quite a bunch of other models into the pool of \"interesting\" ones. A lot of IPS screens, for sure.\n\n2. Apple MacBook Pro 16\"\n\nThe same, 1000+ brightness is awailable only in HDR, in SDR its \\~500. WTH?",

  "Help me decide on snapdragon vs core ultra laptops, please!  Hi guys.\n\nLooking for a new laptop in 1500-2k$ budget. \n\nUse cases with context: \n\nMy bread and butter comes from financial modelling for which I have to extensively use MS Excel. My excel models have ~30 sheets (at max 40-50) with up to 1000 rows filled at max. File size ranges up to 20-25mb.\n\n I have multiple models open at a time (3/4) along with extensive web browsing (20-25 tabs for chromes, sometimes even 50) for research, 5-10 pdf files opened for reading, and usual PowerPoint/Word stuff. \n\nI’m also an amateur photographer. Currently I own a MBA which I use for raw image editing using the default Apple Photos app. I intend to keep doing it on my windows device as well (but maybe shift to photoshop if default windows photo app is not good). \n\nI also want to have the liberty of running python/R scripts on my laptop for basic automation, data analysis from time to time. But nothing hard core. \n\nPriorities: \n\nAbsolutely need strong battery life along with good keyboard and trackpad. \n\nDisplay: Need at least 90hz display if not 120hz. Will prefer OLED displays. 2k resolution at least. Also, touch screen functionality will be preferred as I read a lot. \n\nLooking for a premium laptop which weighs less than 1.5kg and does not get overheated/loud on fans. I’m going to start my post graduation soon, so will prefer something lightweight. \n\nWhat are my options?\n\nAs per my research, 16gb ram is the minimum I should go for but 32gb ram will make it more future proof. Processors that I want: Core Ultra 7 155H, Snapdragon X Élite 78/80. Can’t really decide which way to go. Reviews on snapdragon are good with significant battery life. However, if I similar decent performance and battery life in core ultra laptops, I am good with them too. \n\nSnapdragon Laptops that I like: \n\n-> Lenovo Yoga Slim x (cannot find any fault in this one. Only that 32gb ram/512gb hdd isn’t available readily) \n\n-> MS Surface 7 (only negative seems the keyboard which looks like from a MacBook which I am not a fan of; also IPS screen)\n\n-> Galaxy Book Edge (negative reviews on keyboard/haptic, small battery) \n\nIntel laptops: \n\nI like Galaxy Book Pro 4 and Lenovo Yoga Pro 7. \n\n\nSorry for the long post, but will really appreciate inputs! Thanks in advance! \n\n\n\n",
  "Could look for something with a Ryzen 8845HS if you want both performance and battery life. There's also the AI 300 series CPUs AMD is releasing soon that might be worth looking at. Snapdragon CPUs often have compatibility issues, though there's nothing else at the moment that beats it in battery life for a Windows laptop. Intel Core Ultra tends to be more expensive than AMD options despite not being any better.\n\n\nMight also want a GPU for photo/video editing?",
  "My vote is with Ryzen. Core Ultra is too new for me to say with certainty how good battery life with performance is, but we know that Ryzen had been very good with battery and performance. Not to mention that depending on the Ryzen chip you choose, as long as it's modern, the iGPU on those things range from as good as a GT1030 to up to near GTX1060.",
  "I just think Snapdragon will be benefit for battery life. So would vote for Core Ultra.",

  "Hey, thanks for your inputs. I am actually starting college in September, so have to buy something before it. I haven’t really looked at AMD laptops. I will take a look definitely. Can you recommend me some laptops? Also, don’t think I need a dedicated graphics. It’s mostly photo editing and rarely video. Integrated graphics with 32gigs of ram ought to take care of that. I think. lol.",
  "Will definitely look into the Ryzen offerings. One thing, Not that I am very interested in AI features, but how would the Ryzen chips fare in those?

Releases later this month, might be worth waiting a bit more than that to see how well the AI HX 370 does with performance and battery life, but from the information currently available it's likely it will do better in both factors than the currently available Core Ultra and Ryzen HS CPUs.

The Yoga 7 is really creaky, has really bad speakers and - main reason I want to switch - only has 60hz. My main monitor and smartphone have 120hz and for me its the biggest innovation in years. I only have a laptop paired with an eGPU (RTX 3060) for desk setup, which works pretty well. I also thought it would be nice to have a 2-in-1 laptop for travelling, long haul flights etc.\n\nTo cut a long story short, after some research I decided on the HP Spectre 14 and the Yoga 9i 2-in-1, both with the latest Intel CPU. I pre-ordered both, so I received each of them with almost no reviews (and therefore no BIAS) out there.\n\nBoth versions had new Intel CPU 155H, 120hz (glossy) OLED screen. The Spectre came with 32GB, the Yoga 2-in-1 with 16GB. I wont talk much about performance because it doesnt really matter for me. There are now benchmarks out to compare.\n\nthe sad news first: I returned both laptop\n\n||HP Spectre 14|Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Design|+/- Personally, I didnt really like the design. Its way better / professional predecessor, but I still dont like the bulkiness and the cut corners of the spectre. Looks somehow awkward for me.|No great design as well. Its somehow looks like an unproportional burger. The top of the laptop is smaller then the bottom, in combination with its rounded and glossy edges it looks very akward. I chose colour \"cosmic blue\" which is okay, but a fingerprint magnet|\n|Build Quality|+ Very nice build quality, solid materials - not creaky at all. Very good hinge.|+ Very good, cant complain. Not creaky at all.|\n|Speakers|+ Very good speakers. Quality reduces drastically if you use in tablet mode, since the speakers actually play in the opposite direction|+ I think the best speakers I ever heard on a laptop, since its basically a huge rotating soundbar. This is great in tablet and tent mode as well, because the sound is still going in your direction|\n|Trackpad|+ Very nice haptic trackpad, definitely the best trackpad I ever used (on track with Macbook Pro)|-/+ Trackpad is only ok. Its not haptic, which is a dissapointment in their flagship|\n|Keyboard|+/- Keyboard was ok, but I don't understand the hype about it. I might be biased because I use Lenovo notebooks at work and home for years.|+ Keyboard is nice. But as said, Im biased / used to use Lenovo keyboards. I didnt like the additional row right to the \"return\" button|\n|Display|- Overall, a very nice OLED screen. But no matter.  The screen was absolutely terrible in terms of the 'screen door effect', I couldnt stand the graininess. I had read before that this could be a problem, but I was sure I could get used to it, but in reality it was an absolute nightmare.                   - Another annoying issue with the screen is that it is barely dimmable. I often use the laptop in bed/dark surroundings to stream something before going to sleep. The lowest dim level is still super bright. You have to use extra software to dim it.|- Nice OLED as well. Drastically less Screen door effect to a level I could live with. Also, its dimmable to very low brightnesss out of the box. Unfortunately the screen is super glossy. I mean, so glossy that in dark enviroment even the backlight of the keyboard is reflected.|\n|Other|- The \"Power On\" button is illuminated constantly, which is very annoying|-|\n\nAs I said, I have returned both laptops. I paid around €1700 for each and each had major faults that did not justify the price for me. The main reasons were the displays, I think glossy is just not for me. While I could live with the Yoga's display, I really missed the haptic touchpad and hated that it only came with 16GB.\n\nThe search continues. I think im done with looking for 2-in-1 and will get a tablet instead. Basically all I need is \"good/very good speakers, haptic t rackpad, non glossy and minimum 90hz screen\".  I have now pre-ordered the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4, which has a matte display and a haptic touchpad, unfortunately it is only 13.5\".  I also assume that the speakers will be bad. Will keep you posted :)\n\nHope it helped!",
  "I'm deciding between these 2. The 2-1 format would be useful for document reading etc, but the glossy screen issue is a deal breaker.   \n  \nCan anyone attest to the effectiveness of a matt screen protector to counter act the reflection?",
  "THANK YOU. Finally, someone who actually addresses the screen door effect in both flagship models. I work in the professional visual industry and need crystal clear displays, or at least with less graininess like e.g. Surfaces. I got both the Yoga 7i and Spectre for comparison and it drove me insane. I'm returning both and ordered the 9i now after reading your review - I found a model with 32GB RAM.\n\nOut of curiosity (and to better justify my money spent...) - Would you surmise you would've kept the Yoga 9i if only it had 32 Gigs of RAM?",
  "Do you know if either laptop supports legacy S3 sleep?",
  "lmfaooo please give an update fast. I was looking to buy either of these and now I don't want to.",
  "I am looking for a similar laptop. Thinkbook 13x is really tempting but 14“ would be even better. A bit outside of the box but the new DELL precision 5490 is on the game for me. 14“ Matte bright IPS touchscreen, nice CPUs, etc. You can choose it without dGPU.\nOr maybe upcoming new HP elitebook x360 if it comes with a H CPU.\nMaybe Huawei Matebook X 2024 is an option, no release date on Europe yet.",
  "u/peyta30 FYI, the 2-in-1 Gen 9 is now available with a Sensel haptic touchpad upgrade in the \"Build Your PC\" tool. Right now it's showing as a $60 upgrade, but once the 2-in-1 goes on sale, that discount will also apply to the haptic touchpad.\n\nFYI, the haptic touchpad in the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4 is not from Sensel.",
  "Hey so I've also been tied between the Lenova Yoga 9i pro and HP Spectre 360 16 inch. Both in 32 GB. The main difference is HP uses a OLED screen but 2800X1800 Res while Lenova Uses LED 3200X2000 Res. The lenovoa looked brighter. The other difference is the HP is 2 in 1 where as the Lenova has the Ultra 9 core processor and HP has the Ultra 7 core processor. So one is newer processor and higher resolution. The other is 2 in 1 and OLED screen oh and the HP has much better speakers. My issue now is that there is another Lenova yoga 9i option which is only $200 more which comes with a Mini LED screen, a higher graphics card 4060X, and 1200 Nit brightNess which is exponentially higher then HP and most other Laptops. The ONLY problem I've seen with that higher Lenova 9i option is that the battery is listed at 5 hours but people have claimed it barely lasts 3 hours. Sigh* If it didn't have the battery issue, I'd get the fully loaded yoga 9i in a heart beat so now I'm still tied between the original 9i or HP Spectre both in 16 inch 32 GB with same graphic card.",

  "Hi! That sounds interesting. On which configurator are you referring? I can't find the option on German or US configurator. Anyways, does that mean that you now provide a 80x135 haptic trackpad? \n\nThanks",
  "fsfs lmk. Touchscreen isnt a dealbreaker for me. Just on the fence rn bec he sale for the Hp spectre ends tmr.",

  "What do y’all think of this laptop? This laptop just got released i think, it’s an updated model of the 2023 Yoga Pro 7 (or Slim 7 Pro if you’re in the US i think?) it’s got 32 gigs of lpddrx5 7467, rtx 4050, and the new core ultra 7 155h. It’s more expensive here due to taxes and all that. It’s more compact than a gaming laptop (which is important because i wanna study IT in university and is planning to keep the laptop for 4 years or even more). Has anyone had this laptop? And if you have, could you review it? iirc the last year’s model had some complaints of the screen not being large enough. \n\nThe second slide is the previous year’s model with a 16gb lpddrx5 5200, with an intel i7 13700h. It’s about $200-$250ish dollars cheaper. The question is, is 16gb ram enough for the next 4 years? (I do play some games on the side, but nothing triple A).\n",
  "extra note: im also going to use an external display, so i think the ram size is honestly pretty important.

  "I'd pick the first one, core ultra. I think there is an option to upgrade the RAM.  Anyway, likewise the first comment, if you are the gaming guy, Zephyrus g14 should be better choice for you. Yoga pro 7i is a bit heavy, perhaps 1.5-1.6 kg which comes close to G14.",

  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",
  "Which laptop GPU is quieter? NVIDIA RTX 3050 or GTX 1650 I need to choose between a config with a GTX 1650 or RTX 3050. Same laptop (Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro), though the 1650 comes with a 4600H while the 3050 comes with a 4800H (pure overkill for me). I have zero interest in gaming and would gladly go with an internal GPU if that were available. Unfortunately that would mean waiting 6 weeks for Lenovo, instead of just 2 days.\n\nCurrent laptop (ASUS) has an RTX 2060 with a noisy GPU fan. Hardly ever goes quiet even when I manage to get the CPU fan to quiet down. That's the main reason I'm replacing it.\n\nI thought the more powerful 3050 GPU would be louder but online reviews seem to imply the 1650 is actually quite noisy. Would really appreciate thoughts from actual users. I just want a laptop that runs very quiet.\n\nPosted this again so I could add the option to view poll results. Please leave a comment to explain why you prefer either option. Or if I should just wait the 6 weeks. Thanks\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/u0g3m8)",

  "I have a GTX 1650, and the fans only start up when I start gaming. And for a few minutes every now and then, but it’s quiet. If you don’t plan on heavy gaming, definitely go for the 1650.",
  "The gpu does not matter the laptops cooling capability. If you are not gaming the gpu isn’t being used to the point where the fans need to be on. Most of the time the fans might be on either side but they are dissipate heat from heat sinks that are shared between cpu and gpu. So if you cpu is hot you wil hear both fans. I own a laptop with a 1650 ti max q in a hp spectre. The fans spinning has no correlation with the gpu as the gpu isn’t on most of the time. A cpu will draw more power than a gpu at times resulting in the fan noise. \n\nIf I were you assuming you have the budget go for 3050 it is faster on a newer more efficient node and you have 8 cores which seems overkill rn but won’t be soon.",
  "It's a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro. \n\nMost reviews say it runs quietly but I don't want to take any chances, considering this is the main reason I'm getting a new laptop in the first place.",
  "Thanks for the reply.\n\nIf I may ask, which laptop is this? And what processor does it use?",
  "Theoretically you are absolutely right. Unfortunately my experience with my ASUS ROG Strix with the RTX 2060 GPU has been different.\n\nThe GPU fan comes on all the time. Maybe it's damaged. I've tried absolutely everything. \n\nTried using ASUS laptop management software. Set it to Silent mode. Reduced the CPU processing power in the Power Settings. Even disabled the actual GPU itself. The best I've been able to do is turn off the CPU fan but the GPU fan is relentless. Even MSI Afterburner (the darling of the Internet) doesn't help. So perhaps you understand my worry here.",
  "Check on notebookscheck, they test noise aswell, measure It in db",
  "It’s an Acer Aspire 7 with a Ryzen 5 5500U.",
  "What I can suggest you try to trouble shoot the asus to rule the gpu out is disable it in the bios and see if the occurrence happens if it still does then it might be a thermal sensor triggering the fan not related to either the cpu or gpu.

  "The RTX version will provide a better experience. The 1650 will also run things, but not as smoothly and with not as good graphics. Tbh, the only reason I would tell you to look for a different laptop is the screen. 200 nit LCD is not too good. It doesn’t have HDR either.",

  "So, the laptop is pretty awesome. I’ve had it all week and have found that it’s gotten better with use. The first day I almost took it back because the touchpad was so bad and their own Lenovo Vantage application kept crashing. Once all the updates took effect and the laptop had time to settle in, there were no more issues. \n\nThe WiFi is incredibly fast, and I’ve never experienced a faster initial connection and any device ever, including iPads and iPhones and MacBooks. Instantaneous to the router as soon as your password is in. \n\nThe main feature of the snapdragon version was supposed to be the “snappiness” and the battery life. But this thing has been nothing but snappy—everything happens instantaneously. I’ve never had a machine this responsive. It’s like having your car switch gears without ever feeling the change in the transmission, just unbelievably smooth. That being said, nothing will be the battery life on a Mac, so there’s no real reason to compare. Their ARM efficiency is so vastly ahead of the competition that it’s not even a fair comparison. They’re strange machines to me (MacBooks) in that their computing power is unrivaled, but their interface makes them look like toys for kids rather than serious machines, which I suppose they are but just never really feel that way. My use case on the daily is for Windows-based computing, so that’s why I returned the m3 air I bought earlier this year (that and their new keyboard is awful, paper thin and the keys so closely placed I couldn’t type properly. I was going to lose my mind). Was able to get through work days with no battery life issues, ended up around 40% every day with about 5-6 hours of use, so definitely use dependent. I am not sure if the battery is compromised by having to run a virtual desktop all day? I’m sure someone here can better attest to that. \n\nThe screen is glorious—I’ve never been a fan of OLED for a laptop so that’s actually a plus for me. I almost went and bought a refurbished Lenovo for the mini LED screen it featured, but it was much bigger and heavier than this laptop. \n\nThe portability is insane; the engineering to pack a 15.3” screen while using essentially the body of a 14” laptop is mind boggling. I was reliant on my 2018 intel MacBook Air (still just perfect except for the giant bezels and dwindling battery life) until the aura, and, when you place the 13.3” air over the aura there’s only minimal excess laptop all around. Just an exceedingly slim experience. \n\nI wish the materials were just a tad more premium, with the feeling of the sleek aluminum from the Air still more solid in the hand. Being able to open the laptop with one hand would have been nice, but life goes on. \n\nThe x1carbon aura will probably be the perfect machine w the haptic pad and the choice of oled or IPS based on your preference, so if you’re willing to wait and spend double the cash for the same specs and a one pound lighter laptop then I would do so. I didn’t think it was worth all the extra cash for the upgraded materials, essentially doubling the cost. The HD is fast enough, and for my purposes shelling out extra for a 2280 disk would have made no discernible difference in daily use. \n\nAll in all, stunning and I’m glad I waited for this instead of the yoga 9i meteor lake which was what I was considering previously. \n\n32g \n1 tb \nWindows 11 pro\nAt no additional cost on Lenovos website I was able to also add Office Pro and Acrobat 2020, so that’s an extra $500 or so of software. Good deal right now\n\nArrow Lake and Panther Lake look promising. The future is bright for intel, and the spinoff on their design business is going to be one to invest in for sure.",

This is the best typing experience I may have ever had on a laptop. It's not that this computer isn't well built--it certainly is, it has the military grade durability and so on, but it just doesn't have a \"pro\" look or feel. You can tell it's consumer-grade material. It's like comparing a commercial kitchen product to a consumer grade line--they may be moth stainless steel but there's just a difference in the quality that's probably related objectively in some way, but it's difficult for me to describe or quantify. Please note this is a really nitpicky thing to say--this is the best laptop I've ever owned, and it's not close. I was between this and a macbook pro14\", but I'm super satisfied and felt like it was a great deal to upgrade the RAM to 32 and the 1 tb HD w the free office pro/acrobat std. Really good deal and very high quality with an excellent processor. The silence and coolness of the laptop are really evident as well. I played COD MWIII just to see how it ran compared to my prior Microsoft Surface Book 2 from 2017 which had 16 gb ram and a NVDA 3050 card, and it's not even close how smooth and well this computer handled it. \n\n  \nWould highly recommend if the OLED was an issue for you, because most manufacturers seem to be going OLED route, so if you are happy w the Snapdragon chip and there's no compatibility issues, the only real competitor here would be the Surface laptop, which would cost you another 1500 to have all of the above specs/software. I have been waiting to see what was next for my laptop world since it's been so long, I had to learn a lot about the chip game to understand what I was waiting for. I think the only thing I'd say is if you're not in a hurry, see how these compare to Strix point laptops. If you're like me and have more basic needs that aren't super tech dependent, this is an excellent daily driver. Of course if you have a specialized need you're probably not in this forum anyhow. \n\n\n\nFor the money, you can't get a better laptop. \n\n  \nHope that helps!",

  "Yep, it really is. The zen books have a different ratio I believe so wider and not as tall. It would be helpful if every manufacturer including actual screen size as a function of area rather than diagonal measurement since you’re not comparing the same measurements when the ratios are different.

  "Lenovo yoga pro 9i Aura Edition (Tandem Oled) They just released it, and it looks stunning with its Tandem OLED display, 1,600 nits peak brightness, Ultra 9 285H processor, RTX 5070, and up to 64GB of RAM. It’s like a dream Windows machine.\n\nHowever, why are they still not using anti-reflective coating on their laptops? It doesn’t seem like there will be a matte option for this one either. They claim it's designed for bright environments, but if you're working with a dark-themed interface, the glossy display turns into a mirror.\n\nApple offers a nano-texture option on the MacBook Pro, even though their standard glass already has an anti-reflective coating. Their mini-LED panel is also incredibly bright, yet they acknowledge glare as an issue—just like Lenovo, which provides matte displays on many of its laptops.\n\nSo why isn’t this laptop following the same standard?\n\n",
  "Cuz antireflective coating looks like ass",
  "Just ordered one. Delivery expected in early August though. I am in Canada.",

  "The new tandem model is now listed on the Australian Lenovo website. The \"basic model\" has a price tag of AU$3,999 ( Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 255H Processor and 2.8k 120Hz OLED). If you want the 3.2K Tandem OLED then it only comes wih the Intel® Core™ Ultra 9 285H Processor which is an AU$800 additional cost over the Ultra 7 255H.\n\nSo if you really want the tandem OLED display it is AU$5,400 which is an additional AU$1400 just to get the tandem display.\n\n[https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83L0CTO1WWAU1](https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83L0CTO1WWAU1)",
  "Regarding anti-reflective coating, both the touchscreen models of 2.8K and 3.2K OLED displays ARE anti-reflective. The other two non-touch models are not.\n\nIf you want a glossy screen on a laptop, it is always worth going for a touchscreen model because the anti-fingerprint layer also has built in anti-glossy + anti-scratch resistant feature.\n\nAlso, tandem OLED on Lenovo laptops is absolutely stunning in person.",
  "I could not agree more.  The Dell XPS, starting with 7590 (that I know of) has one of the best OLED anti-reflective treatment.  The recent HP Spectres use the Corning Gorilla DX, which is an anti-reflective variant.  The difference is night and day.  It helps the OLED display work much better and reduce the mirror effect.  \n\nIndeed, the Galaxy Book5 Pro has it too, but the specs are not up to par.  If in fact the Yoga Pro 9i with tandem/touch is like a mirror, that would be a real shame.  I do not know why manufacturers are not including anti-reflective glass.  I'd gladly pay more for it and do not buy computers that don't have it due to my use case.",

  "Did you check galaxy book",

  "I am very sure touchscreen models have no anti-reflective coating. Matte option is available in non touch model.",
  "I'll know in a few days, but nowhere was I able to find in the specs that the tandem touchscreen is anti-reflective.  I have had several touch OLEDs that do not have anti-reflective.  Their specs show all four display variants use the Dragontrail Glass, which in default format has no anti-reflective.\n\nAre you saying that you have/have seen the tandem touch and compared to a non touch version and the touch obviously has anti-reflective treatment?",
  "the best is I believe is integration of anti-reflective displays in supply chain is still an issue and of course cost is a factor.",
  "Yea Galaxy Books come standard with anti reflective coating and they look amazing.",
  "How much discount per your coupon?",
  "when will north America get ?",
  "And later in the US?",
  "Check the new lenovo legions and in descrivtion it says pure sight true black 1000 so it should be the same tandem oled but nobody speak about it ?",
  "Hi Ok-Algae4024\n\nI was expecting around AU$4,000 which is not unreasonable for a Macbook Pro competitor. However, for my applications the Ultra 9 285H processor is overkill. In fact, the Ultra 7 255H is more than I need. Unfortunately, they have \"bundled\" an $800 extra (Ultra 9 285H) if you want to get the 3.2K Tandem OLED display. I will wait for the reviews WHERE ARE THEY! before I decide if the Tandem OLED is really worth the extra $1,400.",
  "It does. I have the laptop, Yoga 7 16 but with the same OLED touch.",
  "I don't kow about non-touch tandem oled on the Yogas specifically, but I've used several non-touch regular OLED laptops from Lenovo and Asus before which had no coatings. The yoga pro's reduction in reflection is about 40% as effective as a typical Macbook's LCD display. So not quite on the level of a really high-end glossy monitor.",
  "I think it's their patented tech and Lenovo would rather just give an option of matte display than integrating that tech into their supply chain.",
  "Pretty sure june. It's already listed on best buy. As usual, north america will not get the 5070 and 64gb ram variant.",
  "Yes for North America it is scheduled to be launched in the second half of the year.",
  "I don't know where you are getting that info from.",
  "Are there any other windows laptops that are considered MacBook Pro competitors - and out of interest, what makes this model to be one?\n\nI could see details on the Lenovo site about a haptic trackpad etc.",
  "Can you post a review",
  "Hi tinybn\n\nI cannot find a Yoga Pro 7  16 with a tandem OLED display on the Lenovo (US) website. The only model advertised with an Tandem OLED display is the Yoga Pro 9 16 (Part Number 83L0CTO1WWUS1).\n\nCould you please supply a link to the Yoga Pro 7 16 which has the Tandem OLED display.",
  "I just got the Yoga Pro 9i Aura with tandem OLED and touch options.  It is a mirror--just as, if not more reflective than my other most reflective OLED laptop.  Putting it next to a Spectre 16 with Corning Gorilla DX, it is night and day.  The Spectre, though still has some reflection, is very subdued.  The Yoga shows my face and every light source behind me.  Again, this is with tandem and touch.  From my view, there is no anti-reflective treatment whatsoever.  U.S. model.",
  "Per their specs, Lenovo uses the Dragontrail glass, which has an anti-reflective variant.  Corning Gorilla DX would have been another option.",
  "It's not patented, Samsung uses Corning DX. Its basically brands cheaping out by not going for Corning DX. Corning also has DX+. This tech has been available for YEARS.",

  "swear i've seen true black 1000 but now when i check it says true black 600, 500 nits brighnrss\n\nlmao. XD",
  "I really like it. I specifically wanted the Tandem OLED and it's great for watching HDR content after calibration. And unlike the Yoga Pro 9i which has 275H, the Yoga 7 has a 17watt low-power CPU that gives it much longer battery life. I get 8-9 hours browing multiple tabs. \n\nMy only gripe is 4 key rollover across Lenovo yoga series. 120Hz and Intel ARC grapgics are all great for playing high FPS games, except the keyboard doesn't register multiple presses very well.",

  "Asus ASUS ProArt P16 review. I think it's one of the best laptops in the market for creators. I've had the ProArt P16 review for almost 1 month now and I am impressed. It runs great, feels and runs like a premium device. I bought it for work and personal projects and I'm honestly happy with what I got. \n\nSpecs and Performance 10/10  - The P16 comes with an RTX4070 which is a solid graphics card. The CPU is AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 HX 370 which trumps and out performs the other top of the line CPU the intel ultra 9. The display is one of my favorite things about it, it's a 4K 16” 4K 60HZ OLED touchscreen. It can run anything and everything smoothly no matter what I'm doing. I can export high quality content faster then anything I've seen on my previous laptops. \n\nMUSETREE and ProArt Creator Hub 8/10 - Musetree has no subscription fees. Before I read that, i planned on ignoring the program. I have to say it's an amazing piece of software and I love that ASUS made it available. I've abandoned  programs like Riffusion and others in the same genre after trying out Musetree.\n\nI'm not a fan of the armory crate but thankfully Asus has the ProArt Creator hub to replace it and I think they did justice with it. While I don't recommend it for experienced veterans in the art and music industry. I do think it's good for beginners.\n\nLooks and graphics - The 4K OLED HDR display is beautiful and the image quality amazes me. I can work and focus on the tiniest details. Working with anything life like is another experience. The display really makes it worth it.  The speakers caught my attention. There are a total of 2 speakers, each built it to the sides of the keyboard. I was surprised at how good the sound is. Theres no distortion, no issues. It's feels almost perfect, like when and my friends go to the studio. \n\nBattery and cooling 9/10 - The P16 is at best warm. You can work all day without it getting hot. That being said, if you decide to game. It does get hot on the top side of the laptop. Above the keyboard and speakers. It is very noticeable to the touch. \n\nThe battery is pretty great for working, it will last you hours. If you decide to game... then it's just like any other gaming laptop when it comes to battery life.\n\n\n\nGaming and the display are fantastic on this laptop. I've never had a laptop that would boot up this fast, that would have 0 issues in every possible way when it came to working and gaming. Badly optimized programs and uncompressed videos are nothing when it comes to this laptop. and games run smooth, the experience is just on another level, and it is a future proofed laptop. Everything is so beautiful and on another level.\n\nThe P16 came with 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate that is NOT trial bound, so anyone can use it. \n\nTLDR - New owner of the ASUS ProArt P16  and had to share how amazing it and is and how much I have enjoyed it so far.\n\n\n\nThe model - ProArt P16 (H7606); Copilot+ PC - H7606WI",
  "it is *nearly* perfect. the glossy screen is not for creators. its for consumers. I contemplate returning it every day because of the super stupid reflections. It's unacceptable for creators. maddening because other than that it is spot-fucking-on Edit: one more thing, I liked the dial idea a generation back, this touchpad's halfway nonsense aint it.",
  "I'm really happy for you, lol kind of hate you for taking that pic like that though would love to see more of it.",
  "Damn, this looks sweet. Wonder if they have a 120Hz version",
  "I have mine for about a month now, loving how light it is when commuting. Programs run well but there’s a few little issues I came across. \n\nFirst week of using it I came across the blue screen of death but somehow it fixed itself.\n\nEvery time I unplug and run on battery the screen flickers on and off. \n\nThere’s been a few times the laptop turned off and took awhile to turn back on . Not sure what’s going on there.\n\nGames run well and the 60Hz does not bother me at all.",
  "Re: glossy screen, any matte screen guard won't work?",
  "I'm thinking about purchasing this laptop. I want to know if I connect this to an external monitor, and will it output at the monitors refresh rate? I'm aware the laptop is 60hz, but sure if connected to something like 144hz, the monitor will display in true 144hz?",

  "How badly does this throttle if you're powered by a 140w usb-c block?",
  "Yes the laptop screen is 60hz by default but what do you guys think about using this laptop with an external monitor with a higher refresh rate? In my case, I have a Odysee G9 OLED, would this laptop be able to push the 240hz 1440p in gaming?",

  "Does it have 120 hz on models other than 4k? ",
  "I bought one and think it's an utter defective piece of shit. \n\nBought one, not even 15 minutes later I get an undismissible pd firmware tool popup that won't go away on restart and won't do any firmware updates. \n\nExpensive unreliable garbage that doesn't work. Do not buy.",
  "Any idea on if and when there will be a newer model released? I am about to purchase one of these (I am about 90% convinced currently) But I could easily wait another 6 months before I pull the trigger and I would rather have the latest and greatest as you don't buy laptops very often.",
  "I agree. As a photographer a glossy screen is a no go.",
  "Hey have you considered using a matte screen protector? I'm thinking of buying this but I'm not too sure now.",
  "I'm in between buying this now and waiting for the new version in 6-12mos (a guess).  I purchased a Zenbook and the amount of chrome tabs or digital assets I am viewing seems to push it to it's limits sometimes and disrupt my workflow. \n\nCurious if you'd recommend waiting for the new version or buying this one now? I'm mostly viewing, editing, download photos/videos for marketing and social media mgmt.",
  "Haha yeah it really does not show how thin it is. When I'm back home I'll snap a better picture.",
  "I always wish they’d get a few shots of the laptop then of the side of the box with specs.. so I can really round it out without looking up model numbers.",
  "No. The PX13 and P16 both have professional 3K/4k OLED screens that are capable of 100%+ color accuracy in every category. They don't make panels like that over 60hz unfortunately. Apparently when you raise the refresh rate on these panels, you lose color accuracy. These laptops are for photo and video editing, modeling, and other \"creative\" purposes first. Gaming is not their primary purpose. The Zephyrus G14 and G16 line is made for that.",

  "If you plugged the port thats directed to the dgpu, if flickers as the internal screen uses igpu, there would usually be another port not directed to the dgpu. (you can check this in nvidia control centre)",
  "Your blue screen fixed itself? \nI entered the BitLocker code, then it got stuck in boot loop. I read on another thread here about reverting back to bios 308, which I did, but it also ended up doing a full reset of windows so I lost everything on there. \nIt's working, but it wants me to keep updating to the newest bios which I believe will cause it to crash again.

  "Such a tough question. Truley a love/hate situation. I might sell this for a new one as well, but I fear they won't add any kind of appropriate MATTE display, which would be the only reason for me to do that. So, I don't think they will address the shortcomings unfortunately. And it is frustrating! Because the laptop is EXACTLY 87.3% PERFECT. The parts that are imperfect are so bad I want to throw it out the window. \n\n**As a Creator laptop:**\n\n**The Good:**\n\n- build quality \n\n- amount, type, and location of ports are perfect. should be standard.\n\n- 4k+ resolution, another thing that should be standard\n\n- battery life (once bloatware and g-helper are sorted)\n\n- led placement and purpose, surprisingly. \n\n- All the hardware is well thought out (yes I'm saying this twice, don't change it!)\n\n\n**The Bad:**\n\n- the touch version of the Aus Dial is beyond useless, it needs to be physical like the original. \n\n- The asus software is silly and bloated. they have around 9 apps and services that can be replaced by g-helper, thankfully.\n\n- The finish (I think there is only black?) is not only a fingerprint and dust magnet, it should be used in police forensics to collect dna. I have to wipe down before and after each use, sometimes with isopropyl. I have never had a laptop this bad (and I've owned a lot)\n\n**The Horrific (should be in prison for implementing):**\n\n\n- the glossy screen. It's a mirror. It WILL give you headaches. It is so bad matte screen protectors do nothing to dim the reflections.\n\n\n- The Soldered, unchangeable RAM. This is a pure cash grab by the industry (thanks apple c!nts), and for creators, it is cutting us off at the knees. \n\n\n- The MAX ram, the highest end unit is capped at 64gb.\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nAs a Gamer Laptop\n\n- Don't buy. look at razer and g14/16.\n\nEdit: My use case is 3d modeling/animation/photography/video editing/gaming/game design... Basically anything with graphics and images for professional production.",

Haven't tested it, though.\n\n\nUPDATE: A USB-C Firmware Update to the ProArt P16 ~1/22/2025, appears to have fixed the USB-C poor performance vs. just being on battery.

  "Lenovo Yoga 7i Gen10, 14-inch laptop (2025) review **UK-based Laptop Review**\n\n**1. Title:**  \nLenovo Yoga 7i Gen 10 (2025) Review: power and portability\n\n**2. Introduction:**\n\nThis is a review for the 2025 yoga 7i gen 10 model from Lenovo with intel core ultra 7 258v and 14 inch screen. I bought the configuration from the UK Lenovo website with 32GB RAM, 1TB SDD, 2.8k OLED 120Hz screen, Luna Grey colour and optioned the fingerprint scanner for an additional £10, paying £1090 in total (including the 10% VIP discount for healthcare workers). This is a premium grade 2-in-1 consumer laptop with a solid build, great for anyone who needs a portable and powerful device.\n\nI haven’t seen many user reviews for this particular generation of laptop so thought it would be useful for anyone considering it.\n\n**3. Design and Build Quality:**\n\nThe chassis all metal, which gives it a very solid feel. The build quality is great, there’s very little flex in the case or the keyboard. The body does not pick up fingerprints. At 1.4kg, it’s not the lightest laptop but it’s still very portable. It fits my 13 inch laptop sleeve. I don’t have much use for the tablet mode as I find it too cumbersome when compared with holding an actual tablet. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and the trackpad is smooth and accurate. I appreciate the double height enter key. Coming from the LG gram 16, this is a much better typing and trackpad experience.\n\nPort selection is good. There are 2 USB-C ports, one on either side, with one USB-A, one full-sized HDMI, a microSD card slot and a headphone jack. The power key is on the right side which I’ve mis-pressed a couple of times so I’ve disabled it in the settings.\n\nThe display is a 14-inch glossy OLED touchscreen with 2.8K resolution (2880 x 1800), 500 nits brightness (1100 nits HDR Peak). I find the screen bright and vibrant. Watching video in a dimmed room is fantastic with zero light bleed. Reflections and fingerprints can be an issue, especially when viewing dark things on the screen and there is bright ambient. However it is still useable under these conditions.\n\nThe hinges are solid, with little screen wobble when typing but it does require two hands to open the lid. The look and feel of the laptop is very nice with smooth rounded outer edges.\n\n**4. Performance and heat:**\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 258v is perfectly capable of handling my usual tasks of multiple Chrome/ Firefox tabs, connecting to my remote desktop for work and steaming video content.  I have tried some gaming and the experience with casual  games has been very good. Fortnite runs at 120FPS. Cities Skylines runs great. I’ve tried playing Watchdogs and although it could play it, the framerates were only around 40fps and the processor got quite hot with the fans getting noisy.\n\nThe keyboard and palm rest areas are always cool. The area under the screen gets warm under load but the hot air is blown out through the vents on the back, away from the user which is a good design.\n\n**5. Audio and Webcam:**\n\nThe speakers are fine, they are up firing from the sides of the keyboard and they are rated for Dolby Atmos. I can clearly hear the 3D effects when watching YouTube or Netflix. There isn't much bass but it is acceptable for a thin and light laptop.\n\nThe 5M IR camera is decent for video conferencing. There is a privacy shutter switch just above the camera. Windows Hello usually takes just a few seconds to log me in. I have found the fingerprint scanner works faster, especially when the lighting conditions are not ideal for Windows Hello.\n\n**6. Battery Life:**\n\nThe 70WHr battery lasts all day for me when web browsing/ streaming videos. I use a 100W Ugreen 4-port USB C charger to charge all my devices and the laptop fully charges within a couple of hours.  \n\n**7. Software and User Experience:**\n\nThe OS is Windows 11 Home 64 and comes with some minor bloatware including McAffee Antivirus, Lenovo support/ vantage/ AI shenanigans. The Lenovo Vantage software has some useful features including dimming various parts of the screen to save battery – I only use the taskbar dimming though as I find the background dimming too distracting. It also enables you to switch the laptop on just by lifting the lid, which means the much maligned side power switch is hardly ever used. There have been reports of this power button breaking easily on other models and thus bricking the device.\n\n**8. Price and Value:**\n\nThe base model costs £1000 (£900 for students or those that qualify for VIP member) and comes with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and a14inch WUXGA OLED screen (1920x1200, 400nits, 60Hz). I was happy to pay the \\~£200 premium for the better spec’d screen with double the RAM and SSD. Mine came with a 65W USB-C charger and a stylus pen which magnetically attaches to the lid.\n\n**9. Pros and Cons:**\n\n* **Pros:** Screen, performance, battery life, keyboard\n* **Cons:** Screen reflections, power key positioning.\n\n**10. Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a well-built laptop where the pros far out-weigh the cons. The OLED screen is fantastic and it has been a pleasure watching content in a darkened room. It is very easy to travel with, having all-day battery life and a thin and light form factor.\n\n**Final Rating:** 9/10",
  "Really nice post.\n\nIm looking into this as pretty much the only option as the price is really good compared to others.\n\nIm sceptical about the hinges, but you say they are fine. And also if the performance is okay, if i could spec it id go higher but there arent really any options. \n\nThe next thing is vivobook which goes about 50% more with worse screen",

  "It doesn't feel heavy but it's not feather-light like the LG gram. The LG gram can be lifted from a corner with one hand easily whereas I'd struggle to do this with the Yoga 7i. The Yoga 7i   feels more substantial, more premium. However it is still easy to carry around in a back pack.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase so far - it does everything I need and I feel it is good value for what you get compared to an equivalent from HP or Apple. As long as I keep the battery in good condition and the hinges don't break, I'm sure it'll last a good 3-5 years. \n\nIf I didn't play PC games, I would have strongly considered a macbook air 13\".",

  "Whats the thought behind charging to 80% - does this extend overall battery life long-term?",
  "Yes, you can play PC games. Fortnite runs at 100-120FPS on the native screen resolution. Cities Skylines plays well.

  "Yoga Pros are solid ultrabooks, but whether it’s good for you depends on the exact specs of the laptop and what you are studying/doing/gaming/working on.\n\nwhat’s your field of study at uni? some degrees will require specific hardware, such as a graphics card, and not all of the Yoga Pro models have discrete GPUs which brings up the earlier question about specs.",

  "that configuration should be enough for your degree. it’s very unlikely you’ll need more than the 3050 for your undergrad.",
  "Can't help you there. It was in stock on Lenovo.com, but that's pricey. I got mine new on ebay with the full manufacturer warranty for $799 (256V model)",
  "okay that’s good. i see so much 3050 hate online so i thought it wasn’t really worth it😅",
  "well, it’s objectively an underpowered and limited discrete card. the hate is warranted, especially for the desktop variants which are extremely poor performance for the price you pay. **it’s a terrible option if your goal is to play video games**. \n\nits use case is different for laptops and students. for what the 3050 lacks in performance, it makes up for in being a very efficient card that draws very little power. in a laptop, you don’t necessarily want a powerful, power-hungry card that heats up like crazy and drains the battery life in 5 seconds. all laptop card variants are much worse than their desktop counterparts, anyways.\n\nfor you specifically, having a discrete GPU at all is largely beneficial for CAD software and other modeling software. sometimes, these softwares require a discrete GPU to even function properly. \n\na laptop is where a 3050 probably shines brightest. for more context, the 3050 is one of the few relatively modern cards that has a model without a power cable. there’s a low-profile desktop GPU 3050 that draws a max of only 50W and is powered solely through the PCIe connector. cool stuff.",

  "okay thanks for the clarification. i might as well get the omen then but ive heard the battery is terrible",
  "it’s a gaming laptop with a powerful CPU. the H model Intel Ultra chips have more cores and faster clock speeds which draws significantly more power. once again, the Yoga Pro is better for battery life and it’s more than enough for your studies, but the Omen is a powerful gaming laptop. its first and foremost built for gaming, which you will never do on battery anyways.",
  "Ryzen AI 7 350 vs Core Ultra 7 258V (Laptop, on Yoga 7) Update:\n\nI ordered the Lenovo Slim 7i from Costco for the additional year of warranty. \n\n///\n\nOriginal Post\n\nHi all, I'm currently shopping for a new laptop and narrowed down my search to a few models (mainly Yoga series, saw quality declining a bit after the pandemic but I'm fine with the quality given the cost). I'd really appreciate some advice on picking the right model for the following tasks:\n\n1. Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, ... applications for data (**main use**)\n2. Streaming, maybe 10-20 tabs open at the same time and Zoom while walking through some excel models (**main use**)\n3. Photo / Video editing (occasional)\n4. Other applications, mainly designed for x86 not compatible with multicore (**main use and resource intensive**; this is how I narrowed down my search to Intel and AMD only)\n\nSetup: just an ultrawide\n\nIdeal weight: under 3.3 lbs. (14')\n\nHere are the specs of a few models I'm evaluating:\n\n1. Ryzen AI 7 350, 16G RAM, 1TB SSD ($749)\n2. \\*(maybe) Rayzen AI 5 340, 16G RAM, 512GB SSD ($599, storage not ideal, but it's much cheaper than the other options)\n3. Core Ultra 7 258V, 32G RAM, 1TB SSD ($999)\n4. \\*(maybe) Core Ultra 5 226V, 16 GB RAM, 1TB SSD ($849)\n\nI'm currently using a 12th gen i5 (i5-1235U, 16G RAM, 500GB SSD, LCD monitor?), I'm ok with the display and battery life (I usually get 3-4 hours when not connecting to an ultra wide) but really need a bigger hard drive. I didn't notice any heating until lately. I do a lot of excel / ppt work, and this is the first laptop that I experienced multiple issues with the keyboard (some frequently used keys fell off due to heavy usage, replaced a few times). I have not used an PC equipped with AMD processor\n\nI think my main questions is, how does Rayzen AI 7 350 compare with the other 3 options on performance (for my tasks listed above)? Thanks!",
  "[deleted]",
  "Ryzen 7 will have great performance and battery life for your use case, while also staying cool and relatively silent, I have Ryzen 5 and most of the day fan doesn't need to even spin\n\nIntel 258V doesn't offer any significant benefit to you for the price difference, it's battery life is slightly better, but outside of that it'll lose",
  "If your use case is particularly heavy in multicore, then maybe the Ryzen 350 may be preferable, plus they cost less, though they are less in demand compared to the 365 and HX 370.\n\nIf what you’re working on has been fine on the 1235U, then I’d actually recommend the 226V. Lunar Lake has proven to be better than Krackan Point basically across the board, like single core performance, battery life, sustained performance on battery power, less heat and fan noise, and better GPU performance (even the 226V is a better gaming and video editing CPU than the Ryzen 350). Among the lower end and midrange laptops, Intel laptops have recently been more desirable than AMD, which probably explains the price difference.\n\nThe 226V is about 7% slower in multicore than 258V, and 4% in single core. If you’re sticking with 16GB RAM, I don’t really see why you’d need the jump from 226V to 258V. I’d save the money for when you need a real upgrade.",
  "I would personally go with the ryzen. Intel has proved that making a CPU shaped oven is possible. And AMD has kept making improvments for 15 years. \nRyzen 7 350= 24500 benchmark\nUltra 7 258v = 19100 benchmark",
  "What I can add to this is that when Lenovo launched the Youga Aura Edition, I bought the 258V one. My use case is lighter than yours, or not, because I use SolidWorks and it works fine. Of course that it's not going to be the same than with my old Threadripper 3960X or my newest 9950X3D. \n\nBut for light tasks, I'm more than satisfied with it after all these time that it's been with me.\n\nWhen it comes to battery life, I haven't used it more than 2 to 3 hours without AC power. Because I use it with an OWC Thunderbolt docking station and it stays 80% of the time plugged in. \n\nOne final thing that it's not relevant to your use case but that it was a bonus for me. I wasn't expecting it to be a \"gaming\" laptop, but I can play at F1 24 with low settings, but it's playable without any problem.\n\nWether you go for AMD or intel, I strongly suggest you go to the 32GB RAM option if possible. With the Yoga Aura Edition, the ram is shared between the CPU and the iGPU. And I assume that with AMD would be similar (but I'm not sure of this).\n\nHope that this helps a bit to make your decision. If you have any additional questions, do not hesitate to reply!",
  "Intel.  The battery performance is significantly better.  Especially with graphics.  Yes, multi core performance better with AMD but single core is better with Intel.",
  "*Streaming, maybe 10-20 tabs open at the same time and Zoom while walking through some excel models (****main use****)*\n\nThat right there is 32GBs of RAM, and let me explain why.  Although 16GBs can handle it, you'll eventually get some bugginess/lag.\n\nFor me at 16GBs, if I have too much open for too long, Firefox's audio component discreetly crashes.  That is, everything goes quiet.  Have no clue if this is FF issue or not, but if open MS PC Manager app and click BOOST, the audio comes right back.  On my system it's when over... say... 68% of RAM is used.  And that's with a lot less open than you just described.\n\nConsider [this](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Vivobook-Lightweight-AI-Powered-Professional/dp/B0DYSPZSHS)?  32gbs RAM, a terabyte of storage.\n\nAnd [this](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Vivobook-2880x1800-Designer-Professional/dp/B0DZCFT1H6) if Ryzen makes more sense.",

  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

  "Laptop comparison: Zenbook14 (amd) vs Yoga slim 7 intel vs Yoga slim 7 gen 10(amd) I just graduated and am planning on buying my second laptop. I am considering either a ZenBook from Asus or Yoga from Lenovo. I will probably receive a work laptop so I need a laptop for normal browsing, maybe upskilling, movies and I play Genshin Impact consistently. once in a while i might play valorant, basically light gaming. I would prefer a 16GB RAM and 1TB storage. 512GB is also fine if other features are good. looking for a laptop with OLED Screen.\n\nI have 3 options that I really like:\n\n**1. ZenBook 14 OLED(2025) :  89,990 Rs**  \n[ZenBook 14 OLED](https://in.store.asus.com/ai-powered-light-weight-laptop-asus-zenbook-14-um3406ka-pp240ws.html)\n\nI really like this laptop and wanted a ZenBook for quite some time. I love everything about this laptop - the color, build, display quality. The amd version of this was released in India a few days ago. It has Ryzen AI 5 340 Processor which i know is quite good. Only downside is its 1TB Version is not yet available in India and I am not sure if it will be released any time soon too. I will have to pay extra for warranty too.\n\n**2. Yoga Slim 7 Gen 10 - AMD AI : 81,275 Rs**  \n[Lenovo Yoga slim 7 Gen 10](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-s-series/lenovo-yoga-slim-7-gen-10-14-inch-amd/83jycto1wwin1)\n\nThis also comes with Ryzen AI 5 340 Processor same as ZenBook. But the display of this laptop is not as good as ZenBook. looks wise i like ZenBook more but this is pretty good too. If i customize this laptop then the cost increases as:\n\n* \\+4000Rs Warranties that are automatically added \n* \\+2000Rs Microsoft office extra\n* \\+4900Rs for 1TB Storage\n* \\+4200Rs for Ryzen AI 7 350\n* \\+3850Rs for *35.56cms (14) 2.8K (2880 x 1800), OLED, Glare, Non-Touch, HDR 1000 True Black, 100%DCI-P3, 1100 nits (HDR Peak)/500 nits (SDR Typical), 120Hz*\n\nThe cost might go upto 93k - 99k depending on the combo. I don't know if Lenovo custom laptops are good cause one of my friends told me something negative about them.\n\nThese 2 are my top options.\n\n**3.** **Yoga Slim 7 Intel, 35.56cms - Core Ultra 5: 79,491 Rs**  \n[Yoga slim 7 Intel Ultra Core](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-s-series/yoga-slim-7i-gen-9-14-inch-intel/83cv008lin)\n\nThe intel version of the 2nd laptop. I was planning on going with amd but this laptop looked pretty good. This one has Ultra 5 125H Processor and its 1TB. I can customize it to Ultra 7 155H processor for extra 15k but then i have to pay extra for warranties and Microsoft Office too. Total would come around 97k.\n\nThese 3 are my major options.

  "Asus ProArt P16 4070 64gb review I've had the ProArt P16 for about a week now and I figured as the information out there is mostly focused on the p13 some people might find this helpful.\n\n(skip ordering if you don't want to see a ramble about what a shit show it was)\n\n**ordering**:  \nMassively lackluster communication in Europe. absolutely no launch day or information regarding the official launch day for any of the ProArt line, just the zenbooks which use the lower clocked AI 300 chips. I got a notification at 1 am on the 27th that they are now available to order for delivery on  the 28th. ordered at 3 am because I happened to be awake, and then the order sat as \"processing\"for over a week. I contact the email support line twice and never heard back, after 5 days, decided to call. first positive part of this is that the phone maybe rang twice and I was immediately talking to a support agent which is very rare in the UK, lovely chap assured me he would follow up on what was holding up the order by the end of the day. never heard back. called again, and again was very promptly talking to a human and he saw the warehouse hadn't answered the first support reps request for an update, and said he would get to the bottom of it, but to wait another 4-5 days til he could guarantee a response. Around 10pm I received an email saying that the order has been \"completed\" and on the order page it gave me a ups tracking number that couldn't be found. At the same time I got an email from the rep I had spoken to earlier in the day confirming that the order had been shipped out and he gave me a different tracking number with a different service which showed it had actually been dispatched that morning before I had called the 2nd time. Overall I'm pretty unimpressed by their entire handling of a product launch for such a premium product, but I'm guessing they just don't care as a more budget focused brand, and they likely don't see the volume on their ProArt line to justify giving more of a toss.\n\nso the shit out of the way, lets get to the product.\n\n**Specs**:  \nCPU: Ryzen AI HX 370 (12 core, 4 p, 8 e)  \nRAM: 64GB LPDDR5 7500  mhz (although I'm getting some strange numbers, sometimes seeing 8400-8500 mhz)  \nGPU: Nvidia 4070 8gb running at PCIe x8 gen 4  \nDisk: 2TB WD SN740 (1.86 usable) (get full speeds, so running on x4 gen 4)  \nDisplay: 4k @ 60hz oled (\\*sad womp noises\\*)\n\n**Form Factor**:  \nGod damn is this thing thin and light. I'm replacing a razor blade 17 and its extremely noticeable at roughly half the weight. Additionally, I've been looking around fro something that can be solely charged with USB C as I'm tired of lugging around several bricks to charge all of my devices, but the power brick supplied is actually remarkably slim and light, making it the first brick I actually wouldn't hate to lug around with me.\n\n**Screen**:  \nbeautiful screen, completely ruined by being possibly the most reflective screen I've ever seen on any monitor. invest in a screen protector with some sort of matte finish because if you run in dark theme, your screen is basically a mirror.\n\n**Touch Pad**:  \nvery nice, only comment is that I have to learn how to hold my hands differently as I frequently move the mouse around and select random bits of text as I type. love the dial, but they really need to work on the palm rejection. Currently I have windows set to disable the trackpad if I have a mouse connected as randomly selecting half the document and overwriting it is annoying.\n\n**Sound**:\n\nspeakers are easily the best I've ever had on a windows laptop and my partner and I really struggled going back and forth comparing it to her 15\" Macbook Air. the air sounds more tinny, but reproduces the balance better at high volumes, where the P16 delivers a much fuller sound, but crowds the vocals at high volume leading to a muddier mix, still I was absolutely blown away by the performance and I had a similar feeling to the first time putting on my HD800s in terms of emotional surprise at the audio fidelity (its obviously not nearly as fine tuned at the HD800's, but with some tuning software, they are extremely good.)\n\n**Fan Noise**:  \nsignificantly louder than most reviewers would have you believe, but it only kicks in if you're playing games at full resolution, max graphics. otherwise its a very slight whisper. even doing several benchmarks didn't even kick on the fans. normal use/ web browsing will be virtually silent. but boy does it take off when gaming.\n\n**Thermals**:  \nnot gaming: you have a laptop.  \ngaming: after 40-50 minutes of pushing the system, upper middle of the keyboard (think the \"6\" key) becomes uncomfortably warm. laptop conveniently converts to \"passive vasectomy\" mode soon after.\n\n**Performance**: (the only thing we really care about)\n\n**Benchmarks**:\n\n**Speedometer**: couldn't get above a 20, quite disappointed with that, but realistically have not noticed even a stutter on anything and I don't necessarily give a lot of stock in a browser based benchmark as there is about a million things that could affect this score.\n\n**Cinebench 2024**:  \nsingle-core: 116  \nmulti-core: 1155  \nGPU: 11038  \nmuch happier with these results, actually beating out each of the systems in my compute cluster which consists of servers running a mix of Threadripper 1950x and Ryzen 5950x, both of which have more cores, all of which are full power cores, which makes the multi-core score even more impressive.\n\n**PassMark**:  \n[https://www.passmark.com/baselines/V11/display.php?id=216744032991](https://www.passmark.com/baselines/V11/display.php?id=216744032991)  \nhonestly kind of surprised the memory score is so low as AFAIK, its absolutely crushing basically any laptop and the vast majority of desktops when you compare the actual benchmark numbers (also intel seems to do almost 2x as well on the same chips over amd, but this is still competing with the top speed intel results, yet still very low overall score)\n\nalso their graphics scores are mega low due to the screen being limited to 60 fps, so tbh this is kinda a crap test.\n\n**Geekbench**:  \n[https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/7300199](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/7300199)  \nagain very nice single and multi-core scores.\n\n**Gaming**:  \nso far its pretty much run everything I have thrown at it with full graphics at native resolution without much complaint. The benefit of the 60 fps limit on the screen means we don't have any high expectation, and it easily handles basically anything up to that 60 fps.\n\n**Battery Life**:  \nlooking at maybe 9:30-10 hours of light use. haven't tested gaming without being hooked up to the wall, because well, whats the point.\n\n**final thoughts**:  \nVery capable machine and I am happy with the sunk cost.  \nAsus could work a little on communication, but the product delivers.  \nthe 60 fps screen has been the only minor gripe, but it looks like the G16 is being released with basically the same specs but a 144hz monitor, so might go with that.  \nAsus for the love of god put an anti-glare coating on your screens.\n\n**most underrated feature: it seems that the sleep mode bug in windows doesn't affect these cpus. in over a week no phantom awakens in the backpack and I even left it off for the weekend and it only lost about 3% battery over 3 days.**",
  "\"looking at maybe 9:30-10 hours of light use.\"\n\nIs the a guestimate, or real-world numbers you have witnessed? because I am only seeing 5-7 hours of web/video on mine unfortunately. \n\n\"Asus for the love of god put an anti-glare coating on your screens.\"\n\nFUCK YES. I look at my reflection more than images on the screen. it's bonkers reflective for a \"Creator\" laptop.\n\nI agree with everything you mentioned in your review. thanks for posting.",

  "Do you visually notice the touchscreen layer, especially on bright backgrounds?\n\nI've had this problem with most high-res touchscreen laptops where the touch layer grid is just super annoying for my eyes (especially when it's that diagonal grid), and yet finding a glass OLED laptop without touch has been challenging.",
  "u/ClassyBukake Thank you for the review of the P16.  It convinced me to pick one up.  I grabbed the RTX 4060 model and so far I'm loving it.

I assume it's to protect the OLED, but I would love to disable it.  Any thoughts?",
  "u/ClassyBukake for the love of god what about Adobe Creative Cloud apps? This is a creator laptop, being able to game doesn't necessarily mean it will perform good with Adobe CC. Not a single word about creator use. How does it perform with Adobe apps under heavy use? Any stutters?",
  "I am looking at the P16, but am worried that the 8GB VRAM of the rtx4070 won't be enough for Unreal engine (especially running the Citysample). Can you comment on 4k editing or software like Unreal Engine or blender?",
  "Just here to drop my opinion.\n\nTL;DR; it looked like a cheap and low quality copy of the m16.\n\nI have seen the ProArt P16 at Bestbuy and I think it's lacking in terms of looks, It looks kinda generic it doesn't have any strong design language. when I first saw it, it was open and I didn't know I was looking at an Asus, I honestly thought that some one was trying to make a knock off M16, I realized after I saw the dial pad that it might be an Asus, that was when I had to check around to confirm.  \nI have nothing to say about performance as I just saw it in passing and I didn't have the time to try any games or benchmark.",

Also, the CPU fan made a cracking noise once, but after a couple gentle hits with one finger on the rear of the laptop, it stopped... should I bring it to an Asus centre to have it checked?

I'm mainly using Chrome with white backgrounds haven't had done a lot of work in Unreal yet, but curious your thoughts on the screen at this point months later?\n\nI looked into a matte screen protector but couldn't find one that seemed well recommended - seen risks of either negatively impacting the image, and/or risking air bubbles on application (high difficulty level basically)",
  "u/ClassyBukake Hi, I am considering buying this laptop for music production and one of the uses I wanted to give it was the recording of vocals in my home studio, and for that the fan noise is very important to me, because if it is too loud it can sneak through the microphone.

  "I took it into work yesterday without the brick, popped it into eco mode and worked about 6:30-7 hours and still had ~35% left when I packed up. Now in this case I was remote desktopping into a dev cluster was literally standing next to, so it was just decoding a 2k video stream using h.264, which Even a 6 watt pico board can do at 60 fps, so very light workload.\n\nI could see if you were doing a lot of heavy multithreaded workloads, it would probably last a lot less, but so far I have yet to reach the point of charger anxiety. Maybe I'll do some more comprehensive testing if anyone actually gives a toss, but my workloads are largely reinforcement learning, coding, and random bits of fuckery, so probably will absolutely shitbrick my battery life stats due to the near constant 100% cpu and GPU utilization.",

  "It charges just fine on my 100 watt charger, even doing just fine while gaming (if the battery was full at the start of the session) it'll just downclock the system during low periods so that it can make up the difference. Can probably game for 6+ hours without having a significant power drop.\n\nI think the base CPU can draw as low as 20 watts on low power mode, and the entire system will draw something like 130 watts at max load, but rarely if ever is a game 100% all the time.",

Amazing! The fans were quiet and didn't heat up much at all under regular but not strenuous load. Have you had any more issues with blue screens? I am really hoping it was just a driver issue or just a bad apple since it was an open box item. Best laptop I've ever used otherwise. I just don't know if I want to spend that much without buying a warranty to go with it. Does anyone know where to buy it with a good warranty? I'm not really keen on Best Buy's warranties.",

Not as outright horrible as the comparable QHD+ Lenovo or HP touch-enabled OLEDs on display – if you sit far enough you might _just_ be able ignore the touchscreen layer. But you can very much tell that it's a layer and not just a panel imperfection. To me it would be usable enough, but I would not be super happy.\n\n\n\nComparing it side by side with my non-touch 4K OLED Blade – while white background on the Blade has some different kind of graining, it is by far less noticeable or jarring.\n\n\nI found the QHD+ Galaxy Books to have the clearest OLED, maybe even better than my Blade. But, well, they're not 4K, and otherwise not the kind of specs I was looking for.\n\n\nSadly I don't have a camera good enough to try and capture the difference visually.",

Mine are stock on \"performance mode\" and had no issues.\n\nMaybe get it checked out?",

  "Funny story since I posted my comment.  I returned the laptop feeling that it was a bad system.  I grabbed a MacBook Pro M3 Pro system.  I used it for a week and decided that the 18GB Ram it had was not enough.  Did some research and somehow found something I must have missed a few times.  \"Stay focused with AI-powered ASUS Adaptive Dimming. It adjusts screen brightness based on your presence.\"  It will dim when it thinks you aren't looking at the screen or around it.  I decided to get the laptop again.  Went to the Best Buy that I returned my laptop to and I was able to my system as an open box.......the one I returned previously.  I originally bought it with a $200 off sale and this time the open box was another $200 off.  I got the laptop for just over $1,400 this time.  I found the setting and disabled it and it's been an amazing laptop.\n\nTL:DR\n\nFound the problem with the dimming and also saved $400 of the OG price.",
  "i pulled the trigger and bought the 64GB RAM version. we'll see how it fairs with Unreal Engine, but mostly  it will be my on the go video editor.  I built a very portable mini-ITX rig with an i9-13900k, 96GB RAM, and and RTX4080-(16GB VRAM) that travels in a pelican case (with an 18.4\" travel panel).  It will be a good comparison.  Stay tuned.",
  "Nope, all I did was set the power mode from the ProArt Hub, or MyASUS... but the fans do make a bit of noise when they start spinning or when they stop... and since you have no coil whine nor fan sounds, I'll probably bring it to a near ASUS centre to have it check... thought, it pisses me off quite a bit since how expensive this thing is... but thanks a lot for the answer!",

  "That's true, but some manufacturers do manage to have much less noticeable capacitive touchscreen layers. It's probably more complicated or expensive to do though, maybe Samsung can only do it because they produce those screens themselves, who knows.",
  "Sweet! I'm really doubting between the ProArt and an MSI Stealth 16 AI Studio. I really like the design of the ProArt and the fact that it has the more efficient AMD chip than the MSI's Intel Core Ultra 9. I can overlook the ProArt having an RTX 4070 instead of the MSI's 4080, but the big dislike for me is the ProArt having a 'glare' screen, and the risk of OLED burn-in. (don't care about the 60Hz).\nIn your opinion, how 'bad' is the ProArt's screen glare, and do you have to take precautions against OLED burn in?",

  "Thank you, then I guess it's not too bad. I'm considering the 32GB/rtx 4060/1TB variant. BestBuy has a decent deal at $1599",
  "I haven’t found it to be a problem in the P16 personally. I had the previous ProArt and it was much much more noticeable. I was actually surprised to see your comment because it was one of the first things I looked for when I got it and was like “heck yes” when I didn’t notice it. Maybe my older eyes are finally having some benefits as my attention to detail is going away lol",
  "Where my laptop sits does get a lot of sun light reflecting off the screen.  The glare is bad, but I've also owned a few MacBooks and the glare was bad with those too.  I'm a bit used to it.  If glare really bothers you, it might not be the laptop to get.",

  "Ya the glare is a feature for some and a bug for others. For me, I welcome it. There are so few laptops out there with a glossy screen anymore.

  "Lenovo Yoga 7 with AMD - good or bad option? My bad if I mess something up on this post, I have to do it on my phone and it's late lol.\nNot too familiar with Yogas; are they decent? My main worry with a Lenovo is that the last one I got, I ended up returning it because it ran into a TON of issues within a week of barely using it - BSOD for no reason, wouldn't correct to wifi after initial updates, delayed keyboard feedback, stuff like that. It was an IdeaPad though, and those are trash anyways (I dunno what I was thinking, getting it in the first place, tbh).\nLooking to get something that'll work for me in college. I am taking art classes and a touch screen laptop would be great. If this, the Yoga, is junk, what else should I look at? Thought about Samsung, but I'm also rather unfamiliar with those too. Are they better for drawing and general school work? Was looking at the 360 ones, but I was a tad worried about the glass screen (hopefully I'm thinking of the right thing) cause I tend to damage things just by looking at them, somehow. \n\nSoooooo. Steer clear of Lenovo, or do I just buy it while it's on sale? College starts next week and while I CAN use the dumb Chromebooks they let students borrow, I REALLLLLY hate drawing with a mouse :)\n\nLink: https://www.bestbuy.com/product/lenovo-yoga-7-2-in-1-16-2k-touchscreen-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-8840hs-with-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-artic-grey/JJGSHX8YFG",
  "Every one have different experiences with brand, personally, Lenovo is one of my top brand laptops pc, they have good spec/price/quality, and the one u have here seem very good, yoga is a high quality category of the Lenovo laptop, AMD CPU can even play AAA game with his iGPU, and price here seem pretty low. Then again, quality control vary everywhere, I have good experience with my Lenovo, hope it’s fine for you",
  "i bought the maxxed out config and i am quite happy with it. the display is gorgeous",
  "In general avoid 2 in 1 laptops, almost always badly built and there isn’t really a good option. And Yogas are usually very thin and break easily on their own. Steer clear of those. \n\nAlso glass screens are usually fine unless whole screen is glass. Stuff where the glass screen is encased in a plastic/metal frame is much better, plastic screens are not ideal.",
  "Thank you for your input. I've seen a loooooot of mixed reviews about the yogas, and as a recent member of the \"I hate ideapads\" community, I've been a bit skeptical of anything that isn't a Thinkpad when it comes to Lenovo... Unfortunately, I'm limited to BestBuy and ThinkPads are out of my price range, otherwise I'd just get one of those and deal with the mouse drawing. I'm glad to hear that you've had a good overall experience with the brand though; I'll definitely keep this in mind when I finally make a decision.",
  "Do the hinges seem pretty good? ",
  "Ah, alright. Do you think it would be a reasonable idea to get a tablet for drawing, and a non-touchscreen laptop (only reason I've been looking at touchscreens is for the drawing, I don't care about them otherwise) for assignments and such? \n\n\nEither way, do you have any suggestions on what I should get?",

  "yes smooth action can initially open with one finger then use 2 to open fully",
  "Used to think the same for touchscreen that I needed it but actually I don’t, but here you’re drawing which I don’t do a lot. You can try a drawing pad.\n\nAnyways, i don’t know much about 2in1s, i only know bad models.",
  "Wish I could say the same about America and customer protection; I've had some pretty bad customer service experiences with pretty much every laptop brand out there, and they usually want me to pay more money, even with a warranty, to get a fix. Wish prices weren't so crazy here too. Feels like I'm spinning in circles just to find something I can afford that I'll be happy with.\n\nI've definitely heard better about the ideaPad pro build quality, so your statement makes sense. The ideapad that I had, and returned, wasn't a pro, and the casing was plastic and felt very cheap tbh. Perhaps I'll just steer clear of anything with a plastic case and see where that gets me.",

  "I'm kinda on a tight budget so I'm probably a bit biased when it comes to my definition of \"crazy prices,\" but from what I've seen, it does appear that tech prices in general have jumped if they are imported in some way. Don't completely take my word on that tho, that was only like 30min of reading stuff online. Not surprising if it's true, it's a dumpster fire over here right now.\n\nNo easy access to huawei that I know of, over here; looks like ebay would be the best option for getting one. I've never heard of them before your comment, so definitely not common over here as far as I'm aware.\n\nThanks for the other suggestions and commentary about them. I'll take a look at the zenbook and Samsung - I was considering getting a Samsung galaxy book 360 when it was on sale but I took too long trying to decide, since I know almost nothing about them as a brand, and then it went offsale lol.",
  "ASUS ProArt PX13 4050 personal review  Got this laptop about a week ago, and since I’ve lurked here and on r/suggestalaptop for info when researching, I thought I’d do a quick write-up of my thoughts in case anyone else is considering this one.\n\nThis is specifically the PX13 4050 model, with:\n\n* AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370\n* 32GB RAM\n* Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050\n* 1TB SSD\n\nThe plan is to use it for occasional/light gaming, but I was mostly interested in a personal laptop that could keep up performance-wise as I get back into art and graphic design. Usually, I’m worried about buyer’s remorse for something as pricey as a new laptop, but I'm happy so far. (Quick disclaimer, I’m fresh off a Dell Inspiron 7415 2-in-1, so I'm coming at this review from a big enhancement in terms of specs.)\n\n**Overall Quality/Durability**  \nThe military-tested durability and gorilla glass was a big perk for me. This model makes me feel much more confident quality-wise than other laptops I’ve had in the past. (Shout out to my old Dell, whose right hinge cracked within 6 months of purchase lmao.) I jump back and forth between tablet/tent mode to laptop mode all the time, and I haven’t once felt a creak or shudder. Very solid all around.\n\n**Materials**  \nThe casing feels pretty premium, I like the matte black look, and the touchpad feels nice and smooth. The keyboard took a beat to get used to - I think the chiclet keys are more raised than other keyboards I've had? - but it doesn't bug me beyond the first minute of typing.\n\n**Screen**  \nThis is a 13.3-in 16:10 aspect ratio OLED, which was a big highlight for me. I’m not the kind of person who often notices small differences in color accuracy/gamut when drawing, but even I can appreciate how sharp the screen is, and I love it for digital art so far. When researching, I worried about the 60Hz refresh rate that some reviews listed as a con for videos/gaming, but it doesn’t bother me at all. (To be fair, it’s also what I’m used to.) \n\n**Overall Performance**  \nMy other laptops have been a struggle to use with subpar RAM, so I’m glad 32GB is standard here. So far so good with anything graphics-intensive like digital art, even when watching movies simultaneously. It’s kept up gaming-wise as well, though I’m mostly interested in platformers and strategy games and haven’t put it through its paces with anything super taxing. It does get a little warm when gaming, with minimal fan noise, but nothing worrying.\n\n**Battery Life**   \nI was nervous that the trade-off for the OLED would be an abysmally low battery life, but I'm getting decent hours (\\~7-8?) of casual use, and I haven't gotten around to playing with settings/software tweaks yet. Since I only use this laptop to work from home, the mid-range battery life hasn’t bothered me.  \n\n**Other Quick Points:**\n\n* **I/O ports** - Pleased with how many there are. The only thing I miss is having two USB-As for my old mouse, tablet, etc., but I get that USB-Cs are the new standard.\n* **Light weight** - I like that this is only 3lbs! Very easy to grab it and go.\n* **Speakers** - These seem pretty standard, not much to say - I usually have headphones in.\n* **Webcam** - Maybe a tiny bit grainy, but still decently sharp for a built-in camera. (BUT...no built-in webcam cover in 2024? Am I just spoiled by my previous computers??)\n* **ProArt Creator Hub** - I particularly like the palette and color analysis tools here. (Just be prepared to learn over and over that this laptop is Pantone certified, because it WILL remind you lol.)\n* **DialPad** - Very fun to experiment with, but I think this is more of a perk for video/photo editors who create stuff using the keyboard/touchpad. Since I’m drawing on a tablet, I haven't gotten a ton of use from it.\n\nOverall, I’m glad I got this laptop. It’s obviously more geared toward photo/video/art creators (who probably want to use it for moderate gaming on the side), and I think it’s perfect for that purpose - especially if you plan to draw on-screen, which I eventually do. I’m getting the ASUS Pen at some point soon, so I may update about the drawing/writing capabilities if I have the chance.",
  "I bought a PX13 with the same specs a few days ago and am very happy with it so far.  \n\nI basically was looking to replace my MacBook Air with something that can run light Windows games.  My main use case is general (non-work) usage and light gaming.  I have a nice desktop PC for AAA and graphic-intensive games, so I was looking for something to play mostly strategy and RPG games while sitting on my couch watching my football teams lose.  \n\nThe PX13 is perfect for what I wanted.  It basically has the exact same CPU/iGPU specs as the Zenbook S16 AMD  model, with the addition of a dedicated 4050 if I need it.  I thought about the Zenbook S14 Lunar Lake model, but the CPU performance is about the same (better, in some instances, for the AMD chip) and the 4050 gives me a much higher GPU ceiling.  For my use case, I don’t need ultra-long battery life, and the 60Hz screen is fine for strategy/RPG games (and the same as on the MacBook Air).\n\nSo far, it’s been a quiet machine.  I can play moderately demanding games on battery and/or in Whisper mode on just the iGPU - and the fans are silent.  The 4050 does a nice job on more demanding games, running in Standard mode.  The fans spin up a bit in that case, but it’s not really noticeable.  I’ve never had to resort to Performance mode to get good game performance.   \n\nTouchpad is great.  I’ve mostly used MacBooks for the past few years and never found a PC touchpad that I liked.  I actually was a bit leery of the touchpad here just based on past bad experiences.  But it’s been very good.  Slightly less smooth that the MB touchpads but still excellent overall.\n\nAnd the build quality is outstanding.  Probably not quite as premium as the MacBooks but much better than other Windows laptops I’ve had.  And the OLED screen is fantastic - better than the MacBook Air.  \n\nHonestly, I feel like the PX13 offers the best of both worlds in the Windows ultraportable laptop space.  The AMD CPU/iGPU combo is comparable to the latest Intel chips, but the 4050 is there to tackle more demanding tasks that the iGPU-only models can’t handle.\n\nIn sum, I wanted a Windows alternative to the MacBook Air.  This is it.",
  "[Here's my PX13 review](https://smbtech.au/reviews/asus-proart-px13-australian-laptop-review/). Does it match what you've seen during this time?",
  "Any Unreal users here? Using this set.\nHow's the launch? Editing, rendering?",
  "Hi! I just got this laptop too about in the beginning of September. I can definitely vouch for all your claims, its an amazing laptop overall with the main caveat being it's battery life. I'm a CS major in College and it get's through my day just fine on a full charge (I have a tighter schedule) but It's something to keep in mind.\n\n  \nSometime the fans do run a bit loud, but I generally keep my laptop on whisper mode so It's rarely noticeable / not a big deal. I have also used this for notes and if anyone is planning on doing that here's a few points.\n\n  \nI use a Metapen btw. I'm not sure if it's the pen or the screen itself, but writing with a pen can be slightly loud at times. I believe because unlike an iPad/tablet which is on a table with a cover on it, this is straight on the glass / not as thick as an iPad/Tablet since when you're flipping the ProArt PX13 the screen and keyboard aren't one piece...? I don't know but it's just a point. Also It's a bit big IMO to use for notes and I get scared of scratching the keyboard(when it's flipped for notes) when I settle it down.\n\n  \nObviously, very avoidable if you're gentle with it but it's another point. In my case I just use a laptop sleeve so I put that under the laptop, which allows it to concentrate more heat so you might feel the screen a bit warm. Nothing unpleasant though.\n\n  \nOverall, it's an amazing laptop as the op said, every point is valid and true. Main caveats are battery, touchscreen if you're using for notes, and the heat sometimes tends to be moderately warm at times. Personally, I'm going to return this laptop for a cheaper ASUS model, the ASUS Vivobook S16, AI 9 365 Processor. This is just because I can get a separate iPad for notes alongside it for around the same price for 1 ASUS ProArt PX13 (I have the same specs as the op). That's just my personal reason for change though.",

I am considering the px13 due to the tablet mode. I currently carry a lenovo legion and surface pro 8 every day one for modeling softwares and one for notes. Im hoping to replace both with this one computer, do you guys think I would have trouble running my software like Revit and Twin motion, photoshop in design, etc... with this device. Im heavily leaning towards it but only if it satisfies my needs. Thank you.",
  "You know i was about to buy a dell xps 14 because of availability on the area, i currently have a dell 2in1 that is 13.5 inch and it works perfectly for my PC needs. But as soon as i read that Dell removed all the Function keys and the delete key and escape KEY, and they even removed the headphone jack? COME ON! that is just a pain in the ass! and the function keys are touch, So i had to let it go, im not going to pay 2000 dollars for something like that. And by luck i found asus did an amazing job with the PX13 which is 13 inch, compact, everything i need.    I had doubts because i dont need an RTX video card, and i like low heat, extreme battery life, because i don´t play, i just work with the laptop,  But i think i will give it a try to the PX13.  The bad thing, because there is a really bad thing, is that DELL has a top of the line support, for example i use a dell 5300 2in1 which is old by many years now and DELL STILL PROVIDE BIOS UPDATES for major security issues that are discovered.  Sadly not all companies have that kind of bios support in future years, and ASUS might loose on that area",

  "I just purchased the PX13 (370/32GB/1TB/4060) yesterday (haven't gotten it yet. )  I am buying it to possibly replace my MS Surface Studio Laptop 2 that I purchased last December.\n\nI don't game, but do graphic design, CAD, basic video editing and coding.  I also travel for work A LOT.  I had (have) a Dell XPS 13 Plus from 2023 which was amazing for travel (in terms of size and weight, but definitely not battery life) and though was not really something I could run CAD on, could handle Photoshop until it couldn't.  I forget which PS version was released, but one day it just couldn't run the program anymore. So I went for the Studio Laptop 2 because of the GPU and I liked the design.  I thought it would be my answer - it can handle everything Ive used it for but it's HEAVY and the battery life is abysmal: < 2hrs no matter what I'm doing on it (even just browsing the web and / or writing code in a text editor).  If I change the power settings from \"Best\" to \"Better\" - the only other option - the computer might go 3+ hours, but it's not usable; Loading webpages or opening applications and files / saving files can take multiple double-digit seconds with system hangs.\n\nSo i did some research on possible alternatives and arrived at the PX13.\n\nMy goal is to be able to work in the Adobe suite, create CAD drawings with occasional renderings and write code on the machine while getting a few more hours from a battery (don't need all-day battery, but enough to get through waiting at an airport or perhaps even waiting at an airport AND being able use it on the flight for a couple of hours - or even sit through a meeting without plugging in).  The specs imply I should get that.  For those of you currently running thos machine, can you tell me if ot will fulfill that role?  What kind of battery life are you getting under average (or even intense) usage?\n\nThanks.",

  "So far, so good! Tbf, I guess it's still kind of early days (<2 months?), but I haven't run into any big problems since getting this laptop, nothing to make me think it's any different quality-wise from any other computer I've had in the past. The only consistent thing is the battery life - it can feel mediocre sometimes if I'm doing something resource intensive. But again, since I'm working at home it's not as big a deal to me as to someone who needs an on-the-go laptop.",

  "Yoga 7 (2020) died after 5 years. Worth trying again? Hey everyone,\nI had a Lenovo Yoga 7, bought in 2020, and it unexpectedly died after five years of use. Tech support said it was likely a motherboard issue (possibly the charging port, which is tied to the board), and the cost to repair just didn’t make sense. They also mentioned it was probably a one-off case and that these models usually last longer.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience with it. About a year before it died, I did get a blue screen of death and had to reload Windows to fix it, but it ran fine after that. . . until it didn’t.\n\nNow I’m debating whether to give the Yoga line another shot. I liked the form factor and performance, but I’m hesitant after this sudden failure.\n\nAnyone here using newer Yoga models? How’s the reliability, performance, and build quality lately? Would love to hear your experiences before I decide.",
  "I just don’t really understand majority of the companies start to make their laptops unrepairable now compared before even the charging port can be replaced with no problems, hard drives can be replaced, but now they start to make it not replaceable. If you are looking for laptops i suggest going with the Thinkpad lineups since they are really built well and last for a lot longer. yoga lineups are good but repairability wise not really good or worth it tbh.",
  "No. Try again with a business laptop. At least they last. Yes, even the modern ones. No laptop should die after five years.",
  "Nah, go for think pad instead they last a lot longer. Yoga and Idea Pads can often face build quality issues.",
  "5 years is a good long run for a laptop. Much longer than that and you're going to start needing to do maintenance such as a deep clean and repasting the CPU/GPU. I would say you overall had what sounds like a good experience, so I wouldn't hesitate to do another Yoga.",
  "Yeah, I was pretty disappointed, because at the time I purchased it, it wasn’t a cheap laptop. My previous laptops slowed down over time, or battery life decreased. This one went out with no warning",
  "I was told otherwise by many other users, especially for the level of use. Also, it would be one thing if it slowly started having those maintenance issues you named, but it literally just stopped on me mid use. I appreciate your input and thoughts nonetheless. I believe if I give Lenovo another chance, I’ll do the thinkpad vs the yoga.",
  "Admittedly, I'm out of the consumer game. Back when I was selling and repairing laptops the general rule of thumb was to expect 1 year for every $200 spent. Again, just an estimate, but it's what we'd tell people to do the accounting in their head.\n\nI'm in the business sector now. We only support machines that are under warranty when it comes to hardware. If we can't extend a warranty and your PC has an issue, we sell you a new one.\n\nThinkPads are great. Yoga's aren't bad by any means, but ThinkPads are better built for sure.",
  "MacBook Pro vs Lenovo Slim 7 So I’m going to uni for CS and need a new laptop. I’m buying from Australia so options aren’t that great compared to the US but I’ve narrowed it down to the MacBook Pro M4 16/512GB and a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 with Ryzen AI 7 350 16gb RAM and 1tb storage. I’m so confused on what to get and was hoping for some help. \n\nP.s I don’t really upgrade tech that often. I use the same thing for like 5-7+ years",
  "OP, MacBook Pro M4 is better for long-term performance, battery life, & macOS ecosystem, while Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 offers more ports, a brighter OLED screen,&  better multi-core CPU power for a lower price, choose MacBook for longevity & Lenovo for Windows flexibility and display.",
  "For CS you'll be better suited with a Mac due to its \\*nix/BSD foundation.",
  "The main problem with Windows laptops in general is that the build quality isn’t that great compared to Apple and after like 2-3 years of use the battery degradation kicks in full force like I barely get 40mins of light use on my Windows nowadays.The Ryzen might have better multi core performance but Apple’s M4 is just so efficient and powerful for some reason. Istg the only deciding factor here is the price, I could get the Lenovo for much cheaper but am I gonna pay for choosing the cheaper option long term?",
  "Ok so come back I just found a better version of the Lenovo with 32gb of Ram and 1tb storage so now I really don’t know",
  "I’ve heard people say the Unix terminal is better but hardware wise the Lenovo is giving me 32gb ram and 1tb ssd which is double the M4’s (16/512)  and the Lenovo costs less so now I’m really f’ing confused",
  "Okay I'm a CS grad as well, with industry and research experience so let me give you my opinion on this. \n\nThe nix shell or the posix shell is better yes and you'll be better suited with it, but considering budget and pragmatism,  you can also use windows subsystem for linux or wsl. So right now, the main deciding factor for you should be which os you're more comfortable with? Hardware specs are one thing but if you have to sacrifice years of workflow and familiarity it's not worth switching. So if you're on Windows now, stay on Windows. If you've been on macOS, stay on macOS. \n\nAnd obviously cost is a no brainer. If you want more bang for the buck and the Windows machine does your job, why not? \n\nP.S. - 32 GB should make it a breeze to run WSL as the underlying VM takes up about 4GB and you can shut it down when you don't need it. (Automatically shuts down after a while of inactivity)",
  "Thanks for the advice but I think I’ll switch to MacOS because I used my brother’s MB Air a few times and it was the best laptop experience I had and I think I also want to explore other options apart from Windows. I’ll only be using it for 4 years then after graduation I’ll return home where I can build a desktop with better specs!",
  "Great! If macOS works for you,  just get it XD",
  "Lenovo Yoga 7 Pro vs Asus Zenbook 14 OR Lenovo Yoga 2 in 1 vs Zenbook S14 Hi, so I am looking for a premium thin and light powerful laptop with great battery life in the premium segment. I have shortlisted to 2 categories and 4 laptops which I have mentioned in the title.\nHere are some basic configurations :-\n1) Lenovo Yoga 7 Pro \n- Intel core ultra 9 285H\n- 3K Oled display\n- Intel arc 140T graphics card\n- 32GB RAM / 1TB SSD \n- Aura édition 8853 MT/s\n- Touch\n\n2) Asus Zenbook 14\n- Intel core ultra 9 285H\n- 3K Oled display\n- Intel arc 140T graphics card\n- 32GB RAM / 1TB SSD\n- Normal édition and less than 8853 MT/s\n- Touch and stylus support\n\n-> 3) & 4) Both have Intel core ultra 7 258V processor which I'm worried won't be sufficient for tasks such as light gaming even. \n\nPlease provide your valid inputs with your reviews and also I would consider yoga 7 Pro but it comes in a single color which I found a little bit unsatisfactory than the zenbook's looks.\nInputs are welcome! Thanks\n\nP.S. - I am going to buy the laptop tomorrow so I need quick suggestions please.",
  "I have the Zenbook 14 (mine has the 1920x1200 OLED, otherwise specs as you listed) and would definitely recommend it. In mixed use (some Youtube, web browsing, a couple hours playing 9 Kings) I've been getting 8-9 hours of screen on time out of the battery, and performance has been excellent. Battery might be slightly better or worse on Windows (I am using Debian Linux), but for the performance I think that much battery life is still mindblowing. The hardware is 100% a premium device. If I could do it over, I would buy this laptop again.",
  "Damn, but didnt you consider yoga 7 Pro cuz it has better features otherwise",
  "Been looking everywhere for someone who has this OLED! The 3k doesn’t appear to be available in the UK. Do you have the reported issues with seeing dots on the digital layer for the touch screen? Do you do a lot of reading and typing as supposedly it’s not great for that either?\nFinally, how is wifi 7 card?\nThank you",
  "I did not. The Yoga 7 Pro doesn't appear to be readily available in the US (where I live) in anything close to the spec you listed, so that takes it out of the running for me. I did find a listing for $200 more than I paid for the Zenbook, which doesn't inspire me much. Are the prices for the two similar where you are?",
  "> Do you have the reported issues with seeing dots on the digital layer for the touch screen?\n\nI don't; however, those seem to be reported by people who view a lot of white backgrounds. I just checked out a white background myself to try to look for it and I *think* I saw a little of it on a fully white screen, but frankly the sheer amount of white light was far more offensive than any pattern that may or may not have been there. With anything not majority pure-white I can pretty confidently say it's not an issue.\n\n> Do you do a lot of reading and typing as supposedly it’s not great for that either? \n\nNot sure how a screen would be bad for typing, personally - if this is re: the keyboard, I have found it to be very solid as far as laptop keyboards go. Primary use case for this for me is as a web browsing machine/capable PC on the go, but it is not my main PC. I have not noticed anything that would lead me to say it's not great for reading, though.\n\n> Finally, how is wifi 7 card?\n\nWorks well, though I can't speak to the Windows-specific aspects of it. No complaints once it was up and running (If you're a Linux user, it wasn't detected by the Debian installer, so I had to use a USB-C-to-Ethernet dongle to get the OS installed; worked fine out of the box once the OS install was complete. If you're a Windows user I am sure it will be perfectly fine out of the box.).\n\nOverall, I'm really happy with this laptop. I bought it as a secondary device as mentioned, but I could happily use it as my main PC (outside of graphically-demanding games) if needed. It's got tons of power in an extremely portable form factor with an excellent screen, which is exactly what I wanted from it.",
  "Well well it's even about a 100$ cheaper here the yoga",
  "Really appreciate you taking the time to reply, thank you.\nI think the reading/typing comment was tied to the screen in the sense of it being suitable for that type of work (coding, desktop publishing etc) vs gaming/entertainment, but I’m satisfied hearing from a real world not review world use case. \n\nI’m probably going to go for ultra 7 rather than 9 - my use case won’t really benefit from the extra power when the trade off for the power is slightly less battery time , and more heat and subsequent fan noise. \n\nThat conclusion is also formed from reviews though, so if you’ve an opinion on that I’m all ears! (I will be running Windows)",
  "I may be wrong (going off of the US website as that is where I am based) but it looks like the Ultra 7 variant is the older 155H, whereas if you want the current crop of CPUs the Ultra 9 285H is the only option; from what I was able to find the 155H and 285H get similar battery life, but you get a healthy chunk more performance with the 285H (as you'd hope). If the pricing is similar imo go for the 9. Haven't found heat or noise to really be an issue with this machine anyway (yes the fan can be heard when it's on like any laptop, and yes putting a big fat 16 core CPU into a thin and light chassis like this means the fan will be coming on regularly - that will be the case both with the 155H and the 285H, so I would not consider it a factor in purchase decisions personally). Obviously, if the 155H meets your needs and comes at a decent discount, then it makes sense to go for it.",
  "How is lenovo Ideapad slim 5 Ryzen 7 7735HS. If anyone have this laptop i really wanna know the reviews. Nd battery too.",
  "FIrst and foremost doubt. Why is the title and description says 7735HS and the options below says 7735U?\n\nBoth of them are good performers. If we go to specifics, both have same cores and threads, 95% details are same between those twooo.\n\nThe only difference is:\n\n* **7735HS** is 15% better in multi-core performance than 7735U. HS is 15% better in performance than U.\n* **7735U** has better performance per watt, meaning slightly higher battery power than 7735HS. U has better efficency than HS (maybe like 10mins more depending on the usage).\n\nMake sure you are getting the model that you are looking for. The seller might have done the incorrect information, but just to make sure you are getting the same contact with them and confirm once. Just a precautionary.\n\n**Disclaimer:** These are rough calculations.",

  "Air will be much better",
  "I would 100% take the better display, refresh rate, more ram, and more storage, for the cheaper price. If you said a MacBook Pro that's a different story but this Yoga is so much better than a base MacBook Air tbh. Also 512gb of storage is crap and in the Lenovo you can actually upgrade the storage later if needed.",
  "I'm looking at the yoga pro as well! For your use case, could genuinely go either way. Unless you're doing really heavy coding and/or music production, or big multitasking, 16GB of RAM and 512 GB will be sufficient for you, so both will perform relatively well. \n\nIf you want longer battery life, a generally nicer build, better longevity and resale value, and you don't mind some compatibility issues with certain software, using macOS, or paying a bit of a premium, go Macbook.\n\nFor my use case (more heavy spatial analysis work, some editing and music production too) the Yoga is better. Ryzen 7 has slightly better multicore performance than the M4 chip, and the extra 16GB of RAM and double storage is good for heavy tasks. Battery life will of course be much worse than the Air and generally less premium build, but this is minimal so doesn't bother me. It's a tad cheaper at least in Australia, and also has a nicer and bigger screen. \n\nFor your use case I'd think about what you need and go from there. What do you value most? \n\nIf you do decide on the Yoga, the AMD version is cheaper and offers better battery life than the Intel ultra 7 255H, at a slight cost in performance.",

I’ve never owned a 2-in-1 before, but my M1 Macbook Air from 2020 isn’t cutting it for all my needs anymore. 8gb of ram with multiple tabs and programs like Photoshop and Davinci Resolve puts me in need of an upgrade. \n\nI do photography, videography, and sometimes light design work using something like Canva. I’d like to learn something like Blender or AE better sometime. Would this laptop be a good solution for an upgrade and that kind of work on-the-go? Or am I really better off with a higher performance machine? I know people will likely point to the M5 macbook, but for the pricepoint, display, and amount of RAM I’m curious what people think of this Lenovo as a step up instead?

  "Need help picking between a Zenbook 14 Oled AMD for US$1200 and a Yoga Pro 7i Gen 10 Aura Edition for US$1400 Hi all, I am looking to buy a new laptop, mainly for work which consists of mainly working on large excel files with macros in them, as well as creating presentations on powerpoint. \n\nThese are the specifications, and since they're quite similar, I'm unsure which would be better.\n\nI have the option to either purchase the Zenbook 14 Oled for US$1200 with the following specs:\n\nAMD Ryzen™ AI 7 350 Processor 2.0GHz\n\nAMD Radeon™ Graphics\n\nAMD XDNA™ NPU up to 50TOPS\n\n14.0-inch, 3K (2880 x 1800) OLED 16:10 aspect ratio - 400 nits - 600 nits peak \n\n32GB LPDDR5X on board and  1TB M.2 NVMe™ PCIe® 4.0 SSD  \n\n\nor the Yoga Pro 7i Gen 10 Aura Edition for US$1400\n\nIntel® Core™ Ultra 7 255H Processor\n\nIntegrated Graphics\n\n32 GB LPDDR5X-8533MT/s (Soldered) and 1 TB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe Gen4 TLC\n\n14.5\" 3K (3000 x 1872), OLED, Anti-Fingerprint, Touch, HDR 1000 True Black, 100%DCI-P3, 500 nits, 120Hz, Glass  \n\n\nI understand the Yoga has a better keyboard and probably battery too, but wondering if its worth spending the extra US$200.",
  "Neither,\nASUS ExpertBook P5 on sale now. That’s the laptop I’d get(if I had the money :*(    )",
  "255h is a bit better chip and the lenovo laptop is just generally higher quality.",

  "Which laptop to buy after the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 14ARE05 (ideapad) ? Hello !  \n5 years ago I bought a Yoga Slim 7-14ARE05 Laptop (ideapad) - Type 82A2 and it has been a blast. It has perfectly fullfilled what I was expecting it to do which is :  \n\\- coding (low level programming like kernel stuff and a bit of AI running)  \n\\- movies/series  \n\\- small gaming on not so demanding games like World Of Tanks or League of Legends\n\nPlus I thought it looked really cool with the metal case.\n\nHowever I am now looking to buy a new one and can't manage to find another one that fits as well as it did, eventhough it was 5 years ago. I went through the Lenovo store and didn't manage to see something that looked to be as good, but maybe I overlooked something.  \nI'm not sure to want a Macbook either since I got comfortable on PCs (and need a decent amount of storage)  \nMy price range can go at maximum to 1200.\n\nWould anyone have any recommandations ?",
  "Did you look for Yoga 7i pro Aura Edition? It comes in either Ultra 7 or 9.",
  "I have yes ! But it is a bit above the price range I can afford (I found it around 1400€).\nThanks for the advice !",

  "Day-1 with a Dell Pro Base 14 (Ryzen AI 7 PRO) and the fan is insanely loud. How do I fix this? I recently bought a new Dell laptop — the 2025 model,  \n**Dell Pro Base 14**, with **DDR5 64GB RAM** and an **AMD Ryzen processor**.\n\n**System model:** Dell Pro 14 PC14255  \n**Processor:** AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 w/ Radeon 860M, 2000 MHz, 8 cores, 16 logical processors  \n**Installed physical memory (RAM):** 64.0 GB  \n**Storage:** 2TB SSD\n\nAt first, I was really excited — this was supposed to be the most high-end laptop I’ve ever owned.  \nBut on the very first day I received it, I was extremely disappointed.  \nThe fan noise is unbelievably loud, and there’s even an unpleasant high-pitched sound that makes it really uncomfortable.  \nNow I have to wear headphones just to block out the noise while I work.\n\nThis is actually my first time buying a Dell laptop. I chose it because, after checking lots of online reviews, Dell seemed to have the best reputation among business laptops.  \nBut my personal experience has proven me terribly wrong.\n\nAre there any experienced users who can share how to fix or reduce excessive fan noise?\n\nFrom what I’ve observed, the noise seems to appear mainly when I connect my dual external monitors.  \nI’m using BenQ monitors connected via Type-C (charging and video output at the same time), but I’m not sure if that’s causing the issue.\n\nSo I tried another approach — connecting the monitors via Type-C without power delivery, while using the dedicated Dell charger instead, to avoid drawing power through the Type-C port.  \nHowever, the noise still persists.\n\nI’ve already switched to Quiet Mode through Dell Optimizer, but the high-frequency noise still shows up occasionally, which has made working on this laptop really frustrating.",
  "It depends on what kind of work you’re doing, specifically how heavy it is. A high pitch indicates coil whine, which is often caused by drawing lots of power. You mentioned the quiet mode resolved the noise to an extent, which basically confirms that power draw is causing the fans to ramp up and create unpleasant noise.\n\nPower draw is inherently increased if you add external monitors into the mix ‘cause it’s more displays the GPU has to render images on, which is usually not that much of a strain unless you’re doing serious work on all of them. Power draw is also increased if you’re charging the laptop just ‘cause the laptop has access to more power without relying on the battery. Laptops running on battery power tend to use the fans less aggressively ‘cause there’s less available power.\n\nAlthough this is less important in the grand scheme, the Ryzen 350 is not the ideal processor of choice if the goal is quiet fans in low power laptops. It should be fairly quiet in light tasks like web browsing, but compared to its low power peers (Snapdragon X, Lunar Lake, and Apple Mx), it would be the first to run its fans during any semblance of sustained serious work ‘cause it technically eats the most power at a time.\n\nHigh end business laptops like the Dell Pro or the ThinkPad or EliteBook aren’t equipped with the most robust cooling systems. The Dell Pro only has a single fan with a standard heat sink, which is typical of low power business laptops today. A more robust cooling solution is usually reserved for high performance laptops that warrant more aggressive cooling, like gaming laptops and creator laptops equipped with dedicated GPUs. Alternatively, a laptop with no fans will obviously create zero fan noise, like the MacBook Air; this is something no Windows laptop with a good processor has achieved, the closest being the Surface Pro, a Windows tablet, running on Snapdragon X Plus.\n\nYou already figured out the solution most laptop power users settled on, especially for people doing heavy work: using headphones. Otherwise, you can try to limit the CPU itself, so it draws less power. This of course assumes you already closed background tasks, removed bloatware, disabled all the startup apps, and updated all the necessary drivers.",
  "Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 vs HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 vs Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Gen 10 Aura Edition Hi everyone!  \nI’ve been researching 2-in-1 laptops for months because I want to buy one during Black Friday and honestly, it’s been *hard*. I don’t know much about PCs or specs, so I’m hoping some of you can lend me a hand!  \n(I would love to be able to use it in uni, to keep it for a solid 5-6 years, to be able to use krita for drawing/ light animations and to do a little light gaming like vanilla minecraft and stardew valley)\n\nAfter a lot of digging, I narrowed it down to three main contenders:\n\n* **Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360**\n   * **Pros:** part of the Samsung ecosystem, anti-glare display, comes with the S Pen, great battery life.\n   * **Cons:** only 16 GB of RAM available, 16″ feels a bit too big, and I’ve seen a few mentions of screen cracking? I couldn’t find many detailed reviews: almost no one seems to be talking about it, and the few reviews out there only cover the 32 GB model (which isn’t even available)\n* **HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14**\n   * **Pros:** 32 GB RAM option, battery life, very sleek design.\n   * **Cons:** keyboard doesn’t seem great, and the audio quality apparently isn’t that good, pen not always included\n* **Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Gen 10 Aura Edition**\n   * **Pros:** keyboard, build quality, OLED screen, 32 GB RAM, pen included\n   * **Cons:** battery life might not be as strong as the other two, and the display seems quite reflective with little to no anti-glare coating.\n\nIf anyone has real-world experience with any of these, or recommendations for better alternatives in the same range, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",
  "Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14ASP9 Hi all\nI'm looking to buy new laptop for myself, i came across this model(32 ram, 1tb ssd, recently 9 365) it looks great to me specs wise considering it can get it for 1k euro with discount. Also i was looking at macs but they're kind of pricey, especially in want to have same storage and ram. I could not really find comprehensive information regarding battery life for this model, either reviewers say it's ok like 7 hrs, or some ppl on reddit say it's abysmal. Is there anyone here who uses it and can share some insights? Also i was thinking of running linux on it, it seems that it's quite compatible and I'm guessing l'l get better battery life?"
