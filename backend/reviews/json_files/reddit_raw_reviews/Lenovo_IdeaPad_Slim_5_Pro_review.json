  "Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5i v Lenovo Yoga Pro 7?  \n\nConsidering these two laptops and wondering what people's opinions are on them? Needing a new laptop for work, personal use and, not essential but a bit of light gaming (very occasionally play games like Rome 2 Total War).\n\n[Buy LENOVO IdeaPad Slim 5i 14\" Laptop - Intel® Core™ i7, 1 TB SSD, Abyss Blue | Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/lenovo-ideapad-slim-5i-14-laptop-intel-core-i7-1-tb-ssd-abyss-blue-10250702.html)\n\n[Buy LENOVO Yoga Pro 7 14.5\" Laptop - Intel® Core™ i7, 512 GB SSD, Storm Grey | Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/lenovo-yoga-pro-7-14.5-laptop-intel-core-i7-512-gb-ssd-storm-grey-10249236.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was also half considering the Dell XPS 13, although the reviews seem mixed and it's slightly above my ideal price range but if it's vastly superior would maybe spend the extra money... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers. \n\n&#x200B;",
  "CHALLENGE THE INTERNET TO FIND ME A BETTER LAPTOP AT THIS PRICE. **I HAVE FOUND THE BEST LAPTOP WITH THIS PRICE POINT.**\n\nToday, I challenge the entire internet's tech-savvy folks to find me a laptop with these specs at this price point. If you do, I will personally apologize and mention your username at the top of this post, stating the laptop you found, along with a personal message of your choice. 😬\n\n*RULE: Small, lesser-known laptop companies don't count because most people don't buy from them. ❌*  \n*(But feel free to give them a mention)*\n\nLook, I live in Malaysia. Are laptops cheaper here than in the US? More or less the same, I believe. I know for a fact that smartphones are more expensive in Malaysia. I'm not that informed about the trade rules and such for importing electronics into Malaysia, so if someone wanna drop facts. Be my guest. ☝️🤓  \n[](https://www.lenovo.com/my/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83HYCTO1WWMY1)\n\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n# The laptop: [Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 (16'', Gen 10)](https://www.lenovo.com/my/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83HYCTO1WWMY1)\n\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n**Review by another guy with the same laptop and specs:**  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDealsIndia/comments/1nsfvxp/bought\\_lenovo\\_ideapad\\_slim\\_5\\_and\\_here\\_is\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDealsIndia/comments/1nsfvxp/bought_lenovo_ideapad_slim_5_and_here_is_the/)\n\n**YouTube review of the laptop, but the specs in the reviewed laptop are different because of just how customizable this laptop is:**  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWoVMdo3ac&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWoVMdo3ac&t)\n\n*\\*As of writing this, I have not purchased* this *laptop. I am waiting till the end of this month for Black Friday deals.*\n\nThis laptop is customizable to your preferences. I have chosen my specs, which have increased the price; you can indeed get this laptop cheaper if you select lower spec options. *🤑*\n\n# My Specs:\n\n* **Processor:** AMD Ryzen™ AI 7 350 Processor (2.00 GHz up to 5.00 GHz)\n* **Memory:** 32 GB DDR5-5600MT/s (SODIMM) - (2 x 16 GB)\n* **Display:** 16\" 2.8K (2880 x 1800), OLED, Glare, Non-Touch, HDR 1000 True Black, 100% DCI-P3, 500 nits, 120Hz\n* **Solid State Drive:** 512 GB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe Gen4 TLC\n* **Camera:** 1080P FHD IR Hybrid with Dual Microphone\n* **Graphic Card:** AMD Radeon™ 860M (Integrated Graphics)\n* **Wireless:** Wi-Fi 7 2x2 BE 160MHz & Bluetooth® 5.4\n* **Battery:** 3 Cell Rechargeable Li-ion 60Wh\n* **Power Cord:** 100W USB-C Slim 90% PCC 3-pin AC Adapter - UK\n\nI have selected the no operating system option because I can save more money on this laptop by either using the free version of Windows or buying a cheaper Windows 11 Pro license key from a site like Whokeys. Not a lot of laptops have this option, so we might as well take advantage of it, am I right? 🤔\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlh6ab3n2k0g1.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=8074d26cf27bc4a88874acbc6d1ae2a215dd48bb\n\n# PRICE?\n\n>!**USD 884.15 or RM3677.64**!< *(This is the MYR price converted into USD to give you folks that are not from Malaysia an idea of the price I'm getting this laptop for. The actual Lenovo US version of this laptop may be more expensive, Idk) 🤷‍♂️*\n\nThis price is from the 11.11 sale in Malaysia. The actual non-sale price is slightly more expensive, but then again, considering how rarely you purchase a laptop, it would be stupid to not wait for a sale to buy. I'm assuming Black Friday will give an even bigger discount. Plus, Lenovo offers discounts for students in high school or college. So if you buy smart, you can get this laptop for even cheaper, making it even more of a steal. 😎",
  "Nice try, but flattery will get you nowhere.",
  "What are you even trying to say?",
  "I'm just giving my opinion on the best laptop for the price. For people who want the specs but can't afford to spend more than $1000. I am also open to hearing others' opinions on what they think about this laptop or if they have a better option. If you don't have anything to contribute, you might as well keep scrolling.",
  "Challenge the Internet! That sounded like supposed flattery meaning someone out there will WANT to take the challenge, and then they do all the homework you are supposed to do in finding a special laptop for you. How many responses did you get??? Let that measure the quality of your question.",
  "If you read my post, I stated the tech-savvy individuals, not the average Reddit user. You know.. people who are already good with tech stuff like this.. I have already done my homework, which is why I am so confident to say \"Challenge\".\n\nQuick question: Do you have any better laptops to suggest? If not, then you don't have to reply to every post maybe thats how you got your 1% Commenter badge through spam. 🤷‍♂️",
  "Out of these laptops, which is the best option? Basically, my sister is heading into college, and needs a laptop. They gave us a voucher, and we're able to choose between only these 5 laptops. I'm trying to help her, and I think that the HP one is the best one, but i'd like some help just in case. So, which is the best option?",
  "None buy a second hand laptop for half the price and double the specs",
  "The Asus or the Lenovo Ideapad.",
  "The Ideapad Slim 3",
  "Lenovo or if u want bigger screen hp. But these are really bad processors. These will prob go to 💩 in 2 or 3 yrs.",
  "Why can't your just go used instead",
  "IdeaPad looks decent, it could be a modern i3",
  "We can't do that. These laptops basically cost us nothing, so its either one of these or nothing.",
  "yeah, but shes currently on a celeron so basically anything is better",
  "voucher is only for this site",
  "What laptop should I buy? Hey everyone! I’m planning to buy a new laptop soon, and I could really use some advice before making the final decision. My budget is around **$600 USD** or less, and I’m looking for a laptop that performs well, looks good, and works smoothly for daily tasks. I mainly need it for **work**, which involves a lot of **video calls**, so a decent **built-in webcam** is actually one of my top priorities. I also tend to have multiple apps and browser tabs open at once, so smooth **multitasking** is really important to me.\n\nOutside of work, I’d like the laptop to handle some casual gaming from time to time. It would be nice if it could run a few games comfortably without overheating or lagging. I also spend a fair amount of time streaming shows and videos, editing documents and presentations, and maybe doing some basic photo or video editing here and there when needed. Overall, I’m looking for a laptop that can handle everyday tasks with ease while still being enjoyable and comfortable to use.\n\nI’ve already done a bit of research and found a few models that seem to fit my needs, but I’m still not sure which one offers the best overall value. I’ll list them below with their prices, along with some quick notes on what I’ve found so far, but I’d love to hear your thoughts or any recommendations you might have.\n\n**$450 USD Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15IAH8**\\- 15.6\" FHD (TN, 250 nits) Intel Core i5-12450H (8 cores, 12 threads), 8GB (soldered) DDR5, 512GB SSD M.2 2242, 1080p Webcam, WiFi 6 , Bluetooth 5.2 , Windows 11 Home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the laptop's material feels cheap, it gets hot quickly, and the battery doesn't last long. It also struggles with gaming and can shut down randomly. While positive reviews say the image quality and Dolby audio are decent, and the camera is great for video calls. The performance is acceptable for work and school. It opens programs fast and charges quickly.\n\nThe second laptop is the same Lenovo laptop but it's the one with an **AMD Ryzen 5 7520U** processor, it does have some other differences so these are the full specs: AMD Ryzen 5 7520U (4C/8T, 2.8/4.3GHz, 2MB L2/4MB L3) 16GB RAM | 512GB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe | 15.6\" matte screen | Windows 11 Home (and Pro on another site). Camera: HD 720p with a privacy shutter.\n\nNegative reviews say that the display isn’t very bright, that it lacks touch functionality, and that the colors have a slight greenish tint. They trash the webcam, saying it's only 720p and not great. The hinge goes all the way back, and the keyboard isn’t backlit. The fan can get noisy during gameplay too.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has an impressive battery life, lasting about 10-11 hours with regular use. The 1080p display is decent, and the built-in speakers sound pretty good. The keyboard is snappy, and the large trackpad is accurate. It has a fingerprint reader for extra security, and you can even open the laptop with one hand.\n\n**$550 Acer Aspire Lite** 15.6\" FHD, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 8 cores Windows 11 Home | integrated AMD Radeon Graphics. DDR4 3200 MHz M.2 PCLE NVMe.\n\nAccording to some reviews, the battery life isn't that good, like 4-5 hours. This is the laptop that the sales clerk recommended. They said the camera quality is decent (like a normal one you would get at this price range).\n\n**$530 ASUS Vivobook Go 15** | AMD Ryzen 5 7520U | 16GB | 512GB SSD | 15.6\" | Windows 11 Home | 2.8GHz (6MB Cache, up to 4.3GHz, 4 cores, 8 Threads) FHD 60 Hz AMD Radeon Web Camera 720p.\n\nNegative reviews say that the fans are slightly loud. It's not suitable for video and photo editing. The webcam is mediocre, not the best one, basically.\n\nPositive reviews say that the battery lasts 7 hours and it charges fully in 1 hour. One review even said that the webcam quality was decent enough.\n\n**$550 ASUS Vivobook 15** AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 16 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM 512 GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD 8 cores integrated AMD Radeon Graphics - 15.6″ FHD windows 11 home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the battery life is not quite long enough to last a full day of work or classes. 1080p display has a cool tint, and it’s heavy at 3.8 pounds.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has above-average build quality and, reliable fingerprint reader on its trackpad. Its backlit keyboard was quiet and satisfying to type on, and its trackpad worked well.\n\nI don't know if this changes anything, but I'm based in Latin America, so do with that information what you will. Thank you in advance!",

  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",

  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Need a system for productivity, VM work, and light gaming with good battery I get into a lot of network simulation like GNS3 and EveNG to run network devices and systems VMs. I also am taking some online ethical hacking courses that uses a lot of VMs for Linux and windows. I don’t like staying plugged in all the time, so I’m trying to find a good mix.\n\nLast year i bought the Yoga Slim 9i 16” and it was fantastic except the battery. That was a joke. It would die with casual use within 2-3 hours or less, and that was with me turning down settings and going to 60hz. If that’s how it needs to be used, what’s the point of all the extra power and features? So I sold it. My 15” MacBook Air M2 has been working out for productivity, but I really need a Windows system back for my VM and simulation stuff. I also miss gaming a little here and there. \n\nI am just not sure what will end up being more important to me feature wise (screen, weight, battery, dGPU etc). I am looking at three systems and leaning towards AMD for battery life, but the Core Ultra 9 185h has more cores for VM work and seems to do ok on battery depending on the system. I also love a good screen, but I don’t do a lot of media consumption really. I don’t know I will actually take advantage of miniLED/OLED or not.\n\nThree systems:\nLenovo Yoga Pro 9 w/o miniLED 32Gb, Intel 185H, 4050 (IPS version is on sale for 1299 at Best Buy. The miniLED version is $600 more because it isn’t on sale, and that’s too much extra)\nLenovo Thinkpad P16s Gen 2 w/ 7840u, 64gb ram, 1tb SSD, 4k OLED 60hz New in Box for $910 (AMD does ok casual gaming, so no dGPU is ok but I kinda prefer one)\nLenovo Ideapad Pro 5 w/ Intel Ultra 9 185H, 32Gb ram, 4050, 2k OLED 120hz refurbished for $850. (Has mixed reviews and a loud track which can annoy me)\n\nI am also trying to stick to under $1500.\n\nIf anybody else knows of something, my needs are:\n16” Nice screen w/ higher resolution (doesn’t have to be 4k) don’t care about high refresh rate on laptops. I’ve had it, and it didn’t much for me.\n32-64GB of ram (VMs take up a lot of ram)\nMany CORES (Ultra 9 has more than 8840U or HS, but not sure how much that will impact VM use)\nGood battery life without having to make it feel like a $300 laptop in features.\nNumberpad - Inputting IP address on a top row of keys is horrible. I have to do that some when i work remote for my job since my work laptop is 14”\n\nThere are a ton of options that fit all of this except battery life. It sucks to constantly worry about plugging in to keep working. I wanted the new Ryzen Ai 370 but there are no systems that meet my criteria except one new MSi system that is priced too high for the specs. I wish I didn’t want the numpad, but I really need it.\n",
  "Gaming laptops heat issues Looking on the Lenovo web store for LOQ options I came across the new Ideapad Pro 5 that has RTX 3050 graphic card (16\" has upgrade option of 4050). The machine is slim, all metal, runs a Ryzen 7 cpu, and doesnt appear to have anywhere near the vents that a LOQ has. I can see where air goes in, but cant see where it comes out.\n\nThe few review vids that I found didn't really mention heat at all, like its just not a thing to bother with. No dramatic thermal images etc.\n\nSo I'm trying to understand why? Why does a business laptop with discreet graphics tick along just fine while gaming laptops have heat concerns despite air vents all over?",
  "Best Laptop  Now I am confused between these 2 laptops. Give reviews, suggestions and help me to decide which one to take. Will be intensively doing programming with a little bit of mid range gaming. Also some AI ML and cyber tasks.\n\nLenovo IdeaPad Pro 5-1,06,000 rs \nLenovo Yoga Slim 7 - 1,06,000 rs\n\nGiving specs in the attachments.",
  "Need help/advice on which laptop to buy. So I'm gonna move for university and will be doing CS as my major. Also I'm a casual gamer, I've always had the dream of having dual monitors and all so needless to say I'll be doing that, but I want a nice sleek laptop which has pretty good specs. I've shortlisted a few below please do feel free to add any suggestions on if I should get any other laptop, or not get any of the laptops from my options below (also please do give reasons). I will be buying a external GPU so yes the laptop has to have a USB port c also choosing this eGPU is another day's work. \n\nMy maximum budget is $1400 but I would like to stay under it so I may buy some decent peripherals also I'd prefer a medium screen (15.6\") can be bigger or smaller.\n\nSo these are my shortlists for now (in no particular order, numbering done so that it's easier to reference):\n\n1.

  "That’s insane. Clean it immediately. I know you said you don’t use it in a dirty environment, but this surely doesn’t happen from a clean environment",
  "Bro this is an insult to me.\n\nJust clean your laptop once per 6 months at least. And your \"environment\" once a week too.",
  "What the fuck",
  "If you don’t know how it got that bad, you are delusional.  You are 100% using it in a nasty environment.  I’m more concerned that you don’t realize that….this doesn’t happen in clean environments.",
  "Clean it immediately please.",
  "vape ?",
  "this must be a troll",
  "That is not normal. Clean it with an air duster, but hold down the fan so it doesn't spin while you are doing it.",

  "Bruh…\n\nLooks like my ceiling fan if I don’t clean it every month or two… I live in the country where it’s always dusty. My laptop will be 5 years old in January, and just cleaned it for the first time. It wasn’t even a 1/4th that dirty.",
  "How is that fan even turning? Or is it not what the what is that",
  "No way this is a year of use in a clean environment",
  "there's a laptop in your dust",
  "WOW... this is insane for a year of use.\n\nI used my laptop for last 5 years and there is little bit of dust stack to blades of both fans, you can't even see the fan here.",

  "Jesus your computer's life probably got halved with that much dust.",
  "No words",
  "You dirty pig 🤢",
  "Pet dander.",
  "That's mostly fabric, they're usually the ones that can clog, regular dust will just go-in then out the vents easily. It's a combination of how good the intake filter is and how much time do you use your laptop inside you room. 1 year cleaning interval is not normal, you may even consider it as neglect.",
  "The fan determined that’s a lie",
  "It's impossible to have a dust free environment, this is normal and you should definitely keep an eye on it. Ignoring it for too long can cause your computer to overheat. My motherboard was shot from overheating and this is probably why",
  "Does it void the warranty to open the laptop's case?",
  "Fans don't make dust... You do (lots of skin cells in dust). \n\nSo, this has been in a dusty environment this is why it's important to clean out laptops every so often. They will load themselves up with dust quicker than you realize",
  "Absolutely NOT normal, I fix laptops for a living and this is crazy bad for 1 year lol",
  "How often did you use it? For example I have a Asus TUF a16 laptop that got dusty after 3 months of having it and I used it everyday playing games all the time. I don't have a laptop stand so the fans didn't get particularly good airflow so that's why it got dusty",
  "Do you vape? the residue will attract dust.",
  "Have you been using it as a part time laundry drier?",
  "Lol take any cloth you own into a bright room and whip it around. That’s what’s in your laptop",
  "Is it turned on a lot? When the fans are spinning they collect far more dust than if it was turned off. When those fan blades spin at a higher RPM the friction in the air causes the fan blade to build up a electric charge which attracts more dust along the active edge of the blade until you get a sizable mass of it blocking airflow. I would say that looks pretty normal for a laptop that sees heavy use. Laptops don't tend to come with the filters you see in desktop builds so dust has easier time getting caked in there, especially with heavy use.",
  "Stop crying and just clean it",
  "One possible explanation is the fan is somehow spinning when it's in my backpack, but lid closed = sleep so idk how that can happen.\n\nEdit: I overlooked the obvious - my little brother took over my room and now I'm set up in my walk in closet. All the clothes probably release a lot of lint.",
  "No effin way. I’ve had my omen for 2 years, didn’t start using compressed air until 2 months ago, I have THREE dogs and a preteen so needless to say my house isn’t spotless….

  "Do you use any kind of cooling pad for your laptop? Where do you use it? Is is dusty there? \n\nBut first of all, just clean it dude...",
  "Just buy compressed air and blow it",
  "My 3 yo gaming laptop doesnt look like that when I 1st open it up. \nYou are living in dirty environment.",
  "Yes, if it is often used in a dusty environment.",
  "Having worked in the medical sector, while it looks clean, it’s likely not.",
  "This would 100% kill the the laptop from overheating over time",
  "I got a laptop early 2020, which I'm still using. I have never cleaned it, and there's maybe 5% of the dust in the fans that's in this picture. You definitely are using it in a dirty environment.",
  "Clean it and everything will be ok.",
  "Hmmmm, I should check my fans…",
  "oh my god no not normal must have been on carpet",
  "If you use your laptop 24/7 and leave it always running then yeah even in a clean environment this would make sense. \n\nI use my laptop occasionally over a few years and there was almost no dust in my fans. \n\nIt's important to vacuum your living space frequently and keep your laptop on a desk. If you have pets, they exponentially increase dust intake. Having this level of dust in one year just points at a high level of dust environment.\n\nI would clean it every 3 months if this is what you gathered over a year. You lost a lot of performance and efficiency overtime, you will gain it back once it's cleaned though.",
  "Very normal, just clean it, ignore the people bashing you for being filthy.",
  "I live in a dirty environment and my shit doesnt get that bad",
  "If you live someplace and you don’t dust and/or bathe often , you live in a dusty environment. Unless you are covering all your skin, you are releasing dust as your skin cells die, what did you think dust was?",
  "Companies fill in dirt pockets designed to burst after a year and clog your fan.\nThat or a dwarf steals your computer when you are asleep and games all night long on your laptop in a construction site.\nOr! You are a lizard and you loose skin flakes like crazy. Must be hard to keep the human disguise.\nNo other explanation is possible. \n\nWell.. could also be that even when you perceive your environment as clean, it's not that much dustfree.\n\n/S\nYes it's normal. Don't let it pile that much, buy a can of compressed air and blow a bit every month. Not a full clean just a few puffs is more than enough to keep it clean.",
  "Gaming laptops are not meant to be used a laptops. They work as a laptop but they're meant to me more of a portable desktop and used on a hard and clean surface while on A/C power. \nThey rapidly charge and discharge which will degrade the battery.\nIf you only have a couple of hours a day where it needs to function as a laptop then that's fine but if you can then plug it in and keep it off of your lap. \nRemember that when you set this laptop on your bed or lap it's going to be like a vacuum. Cat hair, dust, lint, crumbs, and everything else is getting sucked up. \n\nBuy canned air and clean it out every 3 months if this is how it looks after 12.",
  "Do you play right next to your dryer's exhaust? Like a load of lint in there. You should clean your fans and vents at the very least once every 3 months or when it has noticeable dust on it. You clean that up and you will think you got a new computer; it will be running so much better.",
  "You should be dusting it out every month or two",
  "One the plus side od things you can now make a pair of socks",
  "Replace laptop fans",
  "Floating fibers of fabrics in thin air can cause that and other unclean environmental sources..",
  "I've had my Y540 for over two years and only cleaned the fans once, and they were no where near this bad. And I take it to work everyday, and game at home every afternoon.",
  "get canned air and spray out your vents once a month. its called basic maintenance.",
  "If it looks like that after 1 year then trust me, your house is a whole lot dirtier than you think it is.",
  "Lick it",
  "That's dust and you'd likely be surprised how much dust is just in the air around you. One year is also too long to go without cleaning anything, no matter how dirty your environment.",
  "If you vape thc I've seen grimy dust that looks like that on my computer. Doesn't come off easily",
  "What the fuck\n\nYour environment is probably more dirty than you think it is.",
  "That’s honestly an impressive amount of dust. Usually it doesn’t stick to the fan much, it just collects on the heat sync. Definitely clean it, that much weight will hurt the motor",
  "“Lightly used, clean, perfect starter PC, 4500 obo, open to trades, no lowballs.” All jokes aside, your environment isn’t clean, my house produces dust like nobodies business too, just gotta deal with it for now. I’ve opted for a no case PC, so I just reach over and blow that bad boy out every day or 2",
  "Use more lotion..",
  "pets?",
  "Dust in the air isn't really just diet a majority of dust consists of insulation and dead skin cells",
  "Laptops should never be used on soft surfaces. Beds, couches, chairs, blankets, etc.. You said you don't \"often\" which means you do at times.",
  "Your pc can’t breathe",
  "You smoke inside?",
  "Bro dust your house first lol.\n\nDoor trim,  fans, electronics, blinds, picture frames, air vents, change your air filter, change your sheets, vacuum and mop.\n\n\nYou gotta do that stuff once a week or dust goes rampant.   Get a dehumidifier too.  That dust looks caked on like it wouldn't just rub off with a q-tip.",
  "A year? I clean mine every 2 weeks… a year? Explain a non dirty environment? Do you live in said environment? Then it’s dirty. Not saying you are a dirty human, but dry skin flakes off you everyday creating dust just like this. Plus there are things in the air you do not see that are ever present in your abode. Want it clean? Get a dehumidify and air purifier.",
  "Clean once a month or two with compressed air\n\nIts worth buying a cheap 3m air filter that takes A/D/H filters or you can run the furnace fan more often it does a good job cleaning",
  "If you use it in your lap, it’s just sucking lint and dust off you. Lots of factors to consider. Likewise the humidity around you. Seems like vacuuming or just running an air filter would be good, for your own health",
  "now you know why your environment is clean ......",
  "Animals, dust, dead skin, windows open in dusty areas all add this nasty. Change your furnace filter more often.",
  "Close to a heating and cooling vent? I know the desktop was bad for that",
  "Never set a laptop on a carpeted floor while using it, not only will it suffocate it but the dirt collect on the blades just like that.",
  "Pets?",
  "I live in a small town surrounded by farm fields, even though my apartment is kept fairly clean I have to clean my electronics filters frequently just because of the dust in the air.  If you have pets you may want to clean them more frequently.",
  "I've had a legion for about 4 years now. Leave it on 24-7. About 6 months ago I finally cracked it open cleaned it because I noticed dust accumulation on exterior fan intake mesh and it was nowhere near this bad. Granted it's just been sitting on my kitchen table all these years. Maybe that has something to do with the minimal amount of dust. It's literally just sitting there on all the time. Haven't moved it in years.",
  "So this is why you blow out your laptop fans often, doesn't matter what environment you think you're in. \n\nYou can also keep a bowl of water nearby or in the room that will mitigate it but not stop it.",
  "The mental gymnastics some people do on purpose",
  "Uh gonna be honest. You do use it in dirty locations. Thats rediculous",
  "Did you fuckin buy it used maybe? Lmao",
  "Not normal at all.",
  "If you haven't blown it out for 5 years, I would say yeah, expected. I try to blow mine out like 2x a year at least, regardless of conditions.",
  "Its Completely fine dude, you just have some laptop on your dust that's it! you're good to go with the cleanest environment you got!",
  "Mine didn't even get that bad after 4 years..",
  "Hey hombre - these other commenters don't have our machine.  I am an immaculately clean person, and my Legion 5 Pro builds up dust inordinately fast.  That's probably mine if I left it for a year.  I clean mine monthly, so should you.  But yeah, this is completely reasonable for the way this fan works for one year.",
  "Do ya smoke?",
  "Normal? The computer did what a computer does. \n\nYou on the other hand…",
  "Do you have a pet bird?  Those are pretty much living dust manufacturers.",
  "Excuse me wtf\n\nDo you have pets or is your house dusty ?",
  "Dust will always exist and even if you put it on a desk the the computer sucks up all of the junk that's small enough to get into it's vents cause it's impossible to have a 100% clean environment",
  "perfectly fine",
  "Questions;  \n\n\nAre you in a humid environment?  \n\n\nDo you smoke/vape?  \n\n\nDo you have pets?",
  "Liar You are dirty af",
  "Your home is much dirtier than you think it is…",
  "Ok how the hell it didn't take on fire? No ai wanna know 😂💀",
  "It seems that you already got answers, then I'll just add :\n\nWhen you clean it, don't forget to unmount it and check the filter (left of the vent), should be dirty as the rest.",
  "Lenovo is shit, thats prolly why.",
  "This has to be bait.",
  "Fine dust might not be visible to you, but if there is any on the desk, laptop fans will find it. That definitely needs cleaning. I have a Legion 5, and because of how the vent is designed, it's pretty obvious when it sucks up dust. The bottom intakes change color to grey, and that's when I clean mine",
  "X doubt",
  "Forbidden Cocaine",
  "While my fan does not look close to this, I can see through the venting that it does have some dust and debris caked on. What would be the best way to clean this as I’m a total novice when it comes to taking a laptop apart",
  "Take it outside, hold the fan blade from spinning, blast it with compressed air.  Repeat as necessary, maybe every 2-3 months.",
  "You in a nasty environment for sure.  Ignorance is bliss if you think otherwise.  Wtf",
  "Do you shut it down overnight? My 24/7 running dell wyse looks the same after 6 months of uptime. However, my PC and laptop are really clean after two years of normal use (6 hours a day)",
  "Only normal in a dusty environment.",
  "That is mostly dead skin. \n\nHow often do you take a shower? Once a month if you need it or not?",
  "Easy to clean. They still work, just not as well when covered like that, so not super end of world as long as you let it breathe normally. Take a clean toothbrush and turn the fan as you move the bristles along the fins to push the dust, then use some electronics grade canned air for the best results. Other kinds of canned air can cause Static damage to other components if used.",
  "This is exactly what mine looked like the first time I opened it up and I only have it on a desk. A lot of things can get sucked into those fans so just make sure to keep them clean and be a little more aware of where you put it",
  "If in a clean environment, this can happen if the laptop is powered on for long enough. If it's only 1 year old, and if the environment is clean, I believe you almost never turn it off.\n\nIf you do turn it off whenever you're not using it, then I believe your environment is not as clean as you think.\n\nAlso, if you or someone around you vapes, the vapor can cause dust to stick a lot more than it otherwise would. It could also be the case that there were just a few really dusty days and ever since it's been running hot and the fan is always running at top speed, collecting even more dust.",
  "And I thought my bedroom was a dustbowl for having nothing built up on the fan, and the heatsink fins themselves being about 1/4 lightly covered after two years daily driver use",
  "Holy crap that does not look normal. Surprised it hasn't died due to heat damage yet.",
  "How could you possibly say you don’t use it in dirty environments when the fan looks like that? Come on now.",
  "I thought this was a pudding",
  "Well the dust came from somewhere homie, laptops all use basically the same fans lol",
  "Dust is >80% human skin. You are the dust source",
  "I wish my wife were that dirty.....",
  "If that's the fan, I wonder how you lungs look like (0.0)",
  "lol. Just get a duster and get on with it. This is normal if you are in a forced air hvac setting.\n\nIf it's all radiant heat, you might have issues.",
  "How dirty is your place?!\nI didn't clean my laptop fans for almost 3 years and they barely changed color from the dust!",
  "It doesn't matter how clean thr house is, don't use a laptop on the fucking carpet, especially not a gaming laptop.\n\nThis makes me sick, get a board or something to set it on at least, how would you like if every breath you took, was through some dusty old carpet, would probably mess you up too.",
  "You have a cat or dog?",
  "Just think if this is your lungs. Not Good. Recommend cleaning almost every 3-6 months",
  "You'd be surprised about all the sources of dust. Does it sit on a desk? Dust. Does it sit in your lap? Dust. Etc. \n\nI thought my home was pretty dust-free until I got on the air purifier bandwagon. Whether or not the work, that's up for debate. There's no question about them removing dust from the air",
  "Vaping/smoking anything will cause it to condense on almost anything. A bedroom fan will catch a ton of it, and get dirty before a laptop fan. My old roommate vaped and did dabs, then came to me complaining about her fan being junked up. Her room is kept very clean but condensate and natural dust (as well as three cats) did a huge number on the fan and all its parts. Cleaned it out and applied a little wd40, took longer to get really nasty. \n\nBeing clean won't stop the natural accumulation of dust, and places where air moves a lot usually won't accumulate dust like this UNLESS there's moisture in some form. Weather that's from taking the laptop from cool to warm places or vica-versa, vaping nicotine or any plant materiel, taking it to the bathroom even after a shower or during can cause droplets to form on the blade. Even teeny, tiny droplets will pick up ambient dust. \n\nAnd there is dust. Dead skin cells, hairs, residues from cooking and even cleaning chemicals can create or disturb dust, and it'll settle or stick as it must. Best thing to do is clean that puppy as best you can, and do periodic dust checks on any form of electronics. Little old lady homes that are spotless will have PC and TV fans covered in junk from having a human around, and a liberal application of febreeze.",
  "No that much dust is not normal to be in your computer. Please clean it out 2hile you have the case open.",

  "It's so bad that it looks beautiful.",
  "Normal? Its so dirty , your laptop is passive cooled at this point",
  "Also depends on the type of environment.\n\nWhile I was in Africa in a shipping container converted to living space while deployed my laptop after 8 months of not being cleaned didn’t have much dust inside.\n\nI get to Fort Bliss for demob and the thing is dusty again within 1 month.\n\nSince I been in Virginia about every 3 months for same build up however much cleaner living space",

  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",

  "Nice review! Would you mind sharing how the Aura's screen compares to the SL7 you previously had? And how the fan noise in the SL7 was for you in the same setup you mentioned with external monitor?",
  "Thanks for this insightful review.\nRegarding the fan noise, is it possible to use tpfancontrol (or more recent) to customise it ? On both T15 (Gen 1) and L14 they work well to start the fan sooner than the firmware does, but I do not know whether it is possible to delay the fan startup...\nThanks,\nP.S. : additional question : what is the lowest rpm that tpfancontrol can achieve ?",

Best non Mac I’ve ever owned, and I think the x1 carbon will be better in terms of build quality but couldn’t see myself doubling the cost for materials and same specs. \n\nAll in all, a very solid, reliable piece of equipment.",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",
  "For me, the biggest issues so far:\n\n1. Occasional phantom touches - similar to the OP\n\n2. eGPU compatibility (GPD G1) - it used to work with meteor lake laptop which I had (YogaBook 9i).

  "  \nI have had this laptop for a week. I have updated everything that needed updating (Windows and all relevant drivers). Everything is fine except for the Wi-Fi, which is very slow. I usually connect it to my phone’s hotspot (an S23 Ultra), and when I tested it with Ookla Speedtest, the download speed never exceeded 180 kb/s (0.18 Mb/s), while the upload speed reached up to 4 Mb/s. It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do? I bought this from BestBuy in the U.S., but I’m currently not in the United States. While returning it is not impossible, it would be very difficult, and I would prefer to resolve the issue without having to return it.",

  "u/AetherSprite970 Your reviews are excellent and so helpful. Thank you! As a person constantly suffering from eye strain, you've made me aware of the importance of looking beyond just the basic screen specs. In this case, this laptop is an absolute no-go for me based on your experience. I am wondering if iPads suffer from the same problem. I always thought my iPad Pro M1 should give me the most pleasant viewing experience of all my devices, but after just 10 minutes, my eyes hurt like crazy. Is it possible that modern iPads can cause eye strain too?",
  "regarding the Surface Laptop 7, why do you say that arm64 was a too big obstacle? because of some specific application?",
  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues. And if anyone has solved the above issues i'd like to know how to fix it. (I tried bloat removal and even windows reinstall but the issue still persists)",

  "I currently have the G16 and the aura and when it comes to speaker quality, these two are pretty close. the G16 has a slightly fuller bass and slightly wider sound stage. In my opinion if the G16 are a 10, the Aura speakers are a 9.5. I also feel the browsing experience to be much better on the Aura. I experience more lag on the G16 and the fans kick on, the SOC can get too hot for the G16 to sit on the lap, even with light browsing. That being said the track pad on the G16 is better. while the keyboard on the Aura is much better",
  "I was thinking of buying this but it has way too much bass, since I listen to music a lot that's a dealbreaker for me. Also, the bass resonates across the laptop body which creates a weird sensation if you're typing while listening to music.

It had worse PPI (201 vs 222), and worse subjective calibration making it bit washed out, but didn't have the IPS glow issues of the Aura. The AR coating was also better. I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve. The chassis would get way too warm in heavier tasks and the fan would hardly do anything. But still, I prefer the SL7's acoustics. No noise in a docked setup.",

Same strain when docked. Seems to be recent intel GPU’s from what I’ve read, causing issues for those sensitive to dither, or whatever rendering technique it is that causes the pain.",

I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far.

  "You could try to check if the problem is related to your Windows install, or a hardware issue (e.g. WiFi chip, antenna connection). \n\nOne relatively easy way would be to create a Linux bootable USB stick (e.g. Ubuntu). Boot up from the Linux USB stick and check the WiFi speeds. \n\nIf the speeds in Linux are normal, you could then try a \"clean install\" of Windows (download Windows USB install media from Microsoft website).\n\nIf the WiFi speed in Linux is also very low, then it might be worth opening up the laptop and checking the WiFi chip and antennas (does not void warranty).

  "The 9i looks like a nice machine especially with mini-LED, but the chassis is quite cheaply made, like the Pro 7. All plastic interior, including the hinge assembly.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

  "hi I am someone using this laptop for a month. Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo. I have a desktop that goes 165hz and that's more for gaming. sure it's smooth and all but eh not worth the batt life tradeoff).\n\nif you realllly wanna stretch the life, use MS edge as ur browser cuz that's the least battery draining browser out there.

Unfortunately, she decided return the laptop after just one week as the case kept splitting open at the front under the touchpad. This indicates some poor built quality. I tried it out myself for a bit and also found the feeling and aesthetics rather on the cheap and plasticky side. The system also felt very sluggish and performed poorly in everyday web browsing and office tasks.\n\nAfter the MSI Prestige, I recommended my friend to get a full aluminium Lenovo Yoga 7i 14\" instead.

  "Don't listen to people saying no. Yes you can. It won't run at the highest settings but you will be able to play at decent fps. They forget GTA V is basically 10yo at this point and very well optimised. However if you plan on buying this laptop for gaming, please buy something else. But if someone offered you this and you wonder if GTA V will play, yes it will.",
  "Yes you can, i have no idea on why tf people here are telling that you can't, just look up on yt, even with integrated graphics you can run this game, maybe not on 60 FPS on FHD but 900p probably.",

  "Yeah, an older 11th Gen Intel cpu with weaker Intel Iris graphics runs this game at 1080p high at 45-50 FPS. It's pretty reasonable you could get it to run 60fps with this CPU.",
  "Yes you can at lower settings and also use any laptop stand with good airflow otherwise you will destroy your laptop",
  "it should run GTA5 pretty well for a few years",
  "Literally any 'gaming' laptop can run gta 5 because it's a fucking 10 year old game",
  "gta v runs on pretty much anything",
  "It won't run well, but it will run.",
  "Yes as long as your settings are relatively low",
  "yes",
  "yea bro you good",
  "Possibly but not really smooth \nYou'll have to play minimum graphics and it might struggle to get 60fps. integrated graphics suck even with decent chips",
  "Yes you can just not at max probably around low to medium settings but it will run smoothly i had a decade old asus pc with an pentium and gt710 with 4gb ram and it ran smoothly and your laptops better than that so it should run",
  "Yes it will run but not as smooth as you imagine. But it's better to avoid playing AAA games in that Laptop. 13450H with no dGPU and playing heavy games will result in worst thermals. IdeaPad 3 series is not  good for Gaming.",
  "OF COURSE! 13th gen. Wow way to go!",
  "Crysis 2",

  "Yes in low specs, maybe mid",
  "On low settings yes.",
  "If you absolutely must play on it you should downgrade to patch 1.27 of the game because it is better optimized and run smoother for the singleplayer experience. The modern version is a lot laggier due to unoptimized updates being added to the online experience that doesn't benefit the singleplayer experience at all.  However if you want to play online you must use the latest version",
  "Yes",
  "Not with the highest settings but you could",
  "How much is this laptop? If it's not cheap then consider paying 50$ or 100$ more to get a laptop with a external gpu that can provide much more performance almost like x5, if the difference between playing gta v on lowest graphics on 40 or 30 fps and playing gta v on maximum graphics and 100+ fps is just fifty or a hundred dollars then go for that upgrade and you'll never regret it\n\n\nFor me, laptops like the one shown in the picture and such specs, such laptops are being sold here for around 500-550$ while they only have an igpu!!\nI bought my hp victus 15 for 575$ and it has an rtx 3050 and core i5 12450h \n\nAbout 25$ difference in price, but the difference in performance? Not even close, isn't that ridiculous?\n\n\nI'm glad I didn't rush to buy the igpu laptop otherwise I would have regretted it forever, likewise I recommend that you do some research about the prices in your area and weather the prices of external gpu laptops and igpu laptops are close so you can know what to choose and don't rush",
  "Given the I5-8250U can, I'm willing to say yes.",
  "Yes",
  "It will definitely struggle since Intel's iGPU has always been shit with games, but yes it can run GTA5. Whether it can be played comfortably or not, it is relative to your own opinion about it after trying that yourself. Personally I wouldn't be comfortable with that, but you do you.\n\nPerhaps you might wanna opt for Ryzen-based laptops.",
  "Yes definitely. You don’t have a dedicated GPU though but it should run.",
  "Yes. I sure hope a 2022 CPU runs a game from 2013 for the PS3 well",
  "I've played it on i7 5500u with \"dedicated\" gpu which was as powerful as Intel HD graphics. 😆",
  "Yes, but not well. Here's some tips for performance.\n\n1. Turn all settings to low (obviously) \n2. Play around with the resolution and get a balance of visual quality and fps (960p is usually a great balance of both)\n3. If you're still getting unplayable fps look in to optimization mods, just make sure you install One from a legitimate source\n4. Lock the fps, stable 30fps is WAY better than 40fps with abysmal frame times and stutter",
  "If you tweak the INI to not run shadows and stuff and on 720p you can get it to run on steady 30 fps just cap the frame rate with Riva tuner and stuff and know your ways",
  "Oh hell yea it will run great",
  "Are you planning to play with any sort of mods (locally installed or FiveM)? No.\n\nAre you planning to play only the story mode? Yes.\n\nAre you planning to play vanilla multiplayer (GTAO)? Kinda. Expect some hiccups.",

  "Everything can",
  "Yes ofc \n\nI play on a 10yo laptop no problems here for you man",
  "My Lenovo G50 could run it. I finished the entire game with no issues iirc. The only part where frame rates become an issue is in some GTA online heists. Some interiors are badly optimized",
  "Can you? Probably.\nWill it be a good experience? Probably not.",
  "Turn down the quality and maybe the Resolution a little, however this should work out if you really want to play the game, not gawk at the graphics.  Have fun!",
  "Will it run yes will it run well not exactly not saying the laptop is bad the issue is it has no decaded gpu but I think it should run at 720 or low settings",
  "I have a 5 year old basic nitro 5 that runs GTV 5 on lower settings with no issues. I even played the Lara Croft remake on it with no issues, just the first one.",
  "Not really",
  "Yes. Full hd, low quality",
  "GTA V is one of those games that didn't really ever require a fast PC when new.\n\nYour PC should run it very well actually.\n\n\nI played it on first gen iris graphics (8259u) on a mini PC I bought as a emulator box. It did well even back then",
  "Yes. Not only GTA V. But many other open world games with good graphical quality (I guess Batman: Arkham Knight would be peak)...",
  "Cool mom!",
  "Gta v is incredibly outdated at this point so you could probably run it on a potato. It probably won't run great without a discreet cpu but it should run.",
  "It’s good. If you find yourself running out of storage all the time you can get an extra m.2 SSD",
  "You can but I wouldn’t recommend it, GTAV has been a pain in my ass trying to run it on my laptop which is both new and a beast. Not the laptops fault though, it’s rockstars as far as I know.",
  "It’s by far the worst laptop you can buy for gaming with integrated graphics and a U chip (being power efficient)\n\nThat being said, it does run GTA 5 AND it’s very long battery life allows it to double as a school workstation. I was rocking something similar for 4 years",
  "use geforcenow or any other game streaming no need for gpu...",
  "There was a website called pcbenchmark look up there for any game you wanna install on your laptop",

  "Love your mom and respect her as much as possible.\n\n# Paradise lies under the mother’s feet",
  "GTAV was very cpu intensive back in the day. GPU demands start when you start pushing the graphic enhancements. you have integrated graphics, so its you have “the basic”. but it doesnt mean its bad. so dont worry, you have a 13th gen cpu, it will handle it just fine. just start on the lowest settings and start pushing it till you start losing smoothness in the gameplay. have fun!",
  "this is a really nice laptop for school. i would want to have it",
  "It should. A lot of work actually went into making GTA a playable experience on lower-end hardware.\n\nThis one is new enough that the integrated GFX should be able to handle 720p Medium or 1080p Low. I know you can get it running though, because I managed to get it to launch on an i7 4790 from like a decade ago running integrated graphics.\n\nThis will however depend on the thermal solution for this machine. That's where you will likely encounter issues, since it is a slim model. To be fair though, thermal issues aren't uncommon on these types of laptops.\n\nTL;DR: Hardware is adequate enough, cooling may not be. You'll have to test it for yourself to make sure.",

Brand new/post servicing, I was getting 65 in dense regions and 75 smth in open regions. These aren't bad scores but you can pretty much guess that if with a dedicated gpu, I am getting average performance, you cannot really expect too much out of an integrated one.  Moreover, it isn't like you'll be servicing your laptop every week. There'll probably be some here telling you not to listen to us. Your choice at the end who you wanna go with.",
  "Even steam decks can easily handle GTA 5, so yes, just play with the settings",

  "First-hand exp here: I installed GTA V on my 10th gen i5 w/ integrated graphics. It does run okay at low settings. It can get a little choppy at times. I didn't play long since it was more me doing it 'just to see' how it went, so I can't speak for long-term play. But I did play part of the opening mission and it was okay.",
  "Yea",
  "test it and find out the best solution",
  "You could probably run it well at 1280x720.",
  "used to play pretty well on a amd x4 860k and a 750ti. a 13th gen intel CPU will have no trouble (even using integrated graphics.)",
  "You can, just limit to 60 fps and that's good or limit to less if you want to.",
  "1080P, normal settings, lock your FPS to 30, and have fun.

It's your choice. Anyway it's totally  playable, not the best experiencie in the world, but TOTALLY PLAYABLE.\n\n  \nSource: I literally benchmarked this GPU (Intel Iris XE 80EUs) a few days ago...\n\nDepending on the cooling in the laptop you might even go high settings and mantain 30 FPS :)",

  "You can, but since GTA VI is about to drop this year, and probably getting a PC version in 2026, i would invest on a laptop without Integrated GPU.",
  "Yes it should run most older titles just fine at 1080p -720p",
  "It’s not necessarily a gaming laptop but if you tweak the settings right on GTA it’ll run.",
  "GTA5 came out on the PS3... That thing had ddr3 gpu memory at 256mb... a whopping 26 shader cores. yours has like 256. If you want to play gta I bet it would run at 720p totally fine, you can 100% play it.",
  "Time for install Linux on it for the superior gaming experience",
  "GTA 5 is technically a game which was at first made to run on the (by today's standards extremely potato) hardware of consoles like the Xbox 360 or PS3.\n\ni do feel like the PC release of GTA 5 is more closely related to the XONE enhanced edition.\n\n\nwhat im trying to say is that if you lower the settings, you will definitely get a smoothly running game, which might even not look like absolute crap. \n\n\nalso, don't quote me on this, as i haven't used a modern Intel CPU since uhh... the 3rd gen, but i did hear that the ones with Iris XE graphics are surprisingly good for integrated graphics. not sure if Intel still uses them in newer chips or if they just shoved a lower power Arc unit in them. so it really depends on what graphics are integrated into your CPU \n\n\nbut just know that people got GTA 5 to be playable on much worse hardware, so i wouldn't worry too much about it.",
  "If you prefer lowest settings then yes",
  "Integrated graphics!?!?",
  "Install it and you'll find your answer.",
  "No.",
  "With enough tinkering, anything works on anything.\n\nNo worries, you’ll make it work. 💪",
  "definitely, i could play online at 60fps on a 3rd gen laptop i7 and nvidia gt 635m graphics. granted it wasn’t pretty but 60fps is 60fps",
  "Reminds me of the past, enjoyed playing GTA V on i3 10th gen U series processor & 8gb ram",
  "it can because its a 13th gen , integrated graphics can handle a 10 year old game.",
  "Gta 5 came out on the ps3 just remember that",
  "Install it and tweak the settings, no reason why you can’t! Everybody is so entitled nowadays with 10 year olds already having super fancy gaming PCs. I swear when I was like 11 with my AMD liano APU powered laptop that was all I gamed on for a few years until I saved up money for a pc",
  "Just take a 1TB SSD because OS + Steam (or Epic games Store) + Rockstar games Social Club + maybe other games. and FYI, to know exactly of your PC can run the game, go to [pcgamebenchmark.com](http://pcgamebenchmark.com) : enter your components or make it detect and you're done =)",
  "Technically yeah, but will it be enjoyable? Probably not.",
  "We would need more info than just “integrated” for GPU. But the processor and memory are good enough.",
  "Yes",
  "Not well.",
  "yes, my friend played gta on a 2013 pentium laptop with igpu, granted he had to manually disable foliage and effects and play at 600p, but this is a spaceship compared to that setup",
  "No",
  "Try running a quick pcbenchmark exe file on it and find out yourself, you can also check some more games in there. It's been a useful tool for me.",
  "Without a discrete GPU, you will not be able to run it very well at all I would think.",
  "yup 1080p with low settings",
  "You can run GTA with half that prob lol",
  "You absolutely can just keep in mind that it’s probably not going to the the best experience ever if you had a 4090 and what not. But you probably already expected that. As long as you’re having fun, that’s all that matters",
  "It’ll definitely run it. You will need to play with settings to get it to look smooth. With integrated graphics I would expect mid settings or lower end of high. Definitely not ultra.",
  " No",
  "GTA V will run on a rock",
  "Nice gift!\nAs for GTA V, itll run, but don't expect miracles, or high settings/resolutions. It would need a dedicated GPU for that, or a reaaally good integrated GPU. As far as im aware, its iGPU is decent, but not high end.\n\nTL;DR: yes, go ahead play GTA V, itll run at 720-1080p with low-medium settings at around 45-60fps. Youll want to play around with the settings and find the optimal mix of settings your eyes prefer. (Some settings increase visual fidelity more than other settings, while using less power than other Settings.)",
  "I run gta with intergrated graphics 16gb ram and i3500h gonna try it again to see if I average 80 or 90 fps",
  "Mhm normal to high at at least 40fps",
  "Possibly.",
  "Low settings and plugged in? Probably no issue. \n\nNot plugged in or medium-to-high settings? Probably not.",
  "Hell Yeah, great game btw",
  "fuck no. salesmen raw dogged your mom. I'd cuss em out.\n\nnaw fr I'll never get these. they're a niche usage.\n\nyou can get a laptop with a gpu for cheaper than most business laptops. and they'll perform better. cause the offload of the cpu.",
  "It says integrated gpu. GTA won't run very well on integrated graphics. You need a discrete gpu.",
  "Just for fun I ran GTAV on an aspire 5 with an i5 10210U/8GB ram, and at 720p normal settings. I was getting 30+ fps. Don't remember if I tried 1080p or not.\n\nI'm sure this 13th gen i5 can run GTAV at 1080p normal settings with a decent framerate while plugged into the power brick. You also have 16GB ram so even better.",
  "Hell yea. I'm running it on a i5 9300h and a 1660mobile. Runs fine at 1080p.",
  "Kitne ka mila",
  "you can try it just do not expect any high settings since its integrated graphics. I had a laptop in the past with a 10th gen i5 and I was able to run GTA V on lowest settings and 720p. Yes 720p is quite a blur on a laptop but hey, you gotta make do wih what you are given. With the 13th Gen you could probably go on 1080p lowest or at least 900p if GTA V has the option for 1600 x 900.",
  "I managed to run GTA v on an i5 coffee lake (I forgot which gen that is) Thinkpad and on the lowest settings it was actually playable",
  "Bad purchase you could have a got a gaming laptop at this price with dedicated gpu",
  "yes you can!not on the highest settings though",
  "U can technically but at extremely low fps and resolution",
  "I have a worse CPU and i could play it. You might struggle a bit with the integrated graphics card not being able to pull a super good performance graphics wise, but you should be fine running it on low settings",
  "It should work, it's an old game. You can also check to see what games you can run at  [can you run it](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri)",
  "Yes you can",
  "Hell yeah, Gta 5 will run smoothly on this, also go say thank you to your mom🫡",
  "Yes. This game is 12 years old.",
  "I played gta 5 on older system and it ran around 30 40 fps, lowest settings in online 2 player lobbies. so you are fine",
  "Yes, 30FPS ultra low settings at 720p...\n\nWhy, WHY don't parents ask their children instead of Walmart salespeople?",
  "That's really weird laptop. 13420H is quite power hungry CPU, but it lacks Xe iGPU, which is probably one of the few good things about Intel CPUs. This CPU should be paired with some dGPU, UHD graphics is more suited for lighter tasks.",
  "yes but i think u gotta lower the graphics",
  "at 720p with lowest settings it would play pretty smoothly. but its going to look like actual turds.",
  "No.  Gta V needs a dedicated graphics card.  You will get like 10 FPS on this thing.",
  "I believe in the minimum you can I don’t have sure, but try, if you can’t don’t be sad and play other games you have a lot of good games to this configuration",
  "Theoretically it can, however, if you run too many programs in the background it will bog down the performance to unplayable. I always look for dedicated GPUs (even lower end ones like a 3050) for a gaming pc so I don’t run into performance issues with shared graphics memory.",
  "Yes. But can it play Crysis?",
  "I wish my mom gifted me anything other than 5$ basic tee’s smh",
  "You can play GTA V on Intel HD 530(Intel 6th gen cpus) and above integrated gpus",
  "GTA ran on Xbox 360 and PS3. This is fine",
  "Afcourse I did to just disable the antivirus bcuz that take so much processing and power and plug in the laptop to charger and do the mix power on the battery setting",
  "60fps at 1080p low, probably. You will have to temper your expectations but yes it will run.",
  "Yes! I tried it on my laptop with very similar specs. It ran 40+ fps with medium settings at 900p. Very playable and good for casual gaming.",
  "Play RDR2 instead",
  "you may be able to play the game regarding the high cpu and ram and it may run on a intergrated GPU just try and use low settings (you may not have the best graphics but you'll defo get loads of FPS)",
  "Yes, that's a very well optimized game.\n\nNow, if you want to play AAA games, you might want to get an eGPU, like a rx6600",
  "Yes",
  "Easily, I played GTA 5 on 8gb ram 11gen i5 with 'U' letter at the last (which means it is not ment for games) in 60fps with 1080p low settings your is 13 gen and has H at the last which means it is made for gaming, but since it doesn't have graphic card it can't game good latest games, but GTA 5 is 19yr old and very well optimized game so you will run it easily at 1080p low settings and maybe even high settings, not maxed out but high settings",
  "Yeah, it’ll handle it. Just start with the lowest quality settings and go from there. Also, make sure to set the laptop on a hard surface so that it can breathe well. It’ll get hot. Don’t be one of those animals that game with their laptop sitting on the bed, please.",
  "Integrated graphics, no it won't work well. It will run, probably at 40fps max which isn't great. It'll be 40fps but feel like 20 because of frame times. It's a 2.1ghz cpu that might boost to 3.5ghz if you're lucky. This is a media laptop, it's meant for watching movies and just general Internet browsing. \n\n\nI actually just looked it up on YouTube, you'll be lucky to hit 30fps. It looks like the frame rate drops hard in the middle of the city and any PC gamer can agree that sudden fps drops are very jarring. Everyone saying it will run fine didn't do a simple Google search, it will run, it will not run well. This laptop will barely be able to run Minecraft. Thank you mother, it's a very kind gift, but didn't get your hopes up about any real performance from this machine.",
  "Idk why would you want to play GTA V on that, don't you have a chair? If you insist, you can, but your ass gonna feel uncomfortable.",
  "I run GTA v in the lower options in a laptop whit a core i7 4600u and 8 in DDR3 ram at 30 fps, you surely can",
  "You can, but on low settings, it might be laggy at times but upgrade the RAM.",
  "I think you can even connect it to a external gpu",
  "Should not be an issue.\n\nI had it installed on a 5th gen i5, it ran like complete ass but ran.",
  "No",
  "No it’s a box.",
  "No, you need to buy the game.",
  "You can attempt if you wish but you’ll get like two fps on the lowest settings",
  "I love how humble u are",
  "Bro i can play it on my HP desktop and that only has 8GB of RAM (albeit it isn’t very smooth) but it runs alright. That will be fine.",
  "It might work on this, but you'll probably have to turn some settings down - very decent machine overall it just doesn't have a graphics processor that is dedicated. Give it a shot, I bet you can get it to run, and just go into the settings and turn down shadow quality first, if you have issues with it. keep coming back and we can help you get it going",
  "Its integrated gpu so uses ram as a vram, if you wanna do gaming on it you need to upgrade your ram minimum to 32 but for gta V it should be enough as it is right now",
  "Yeah it's really cool you can play on android too.",
  "The ONLY issue with that is the integrated graphics card, but gta5 is an older game, and integrated graphics cards have been getting better to my understanding.\n\nRegardless of that laptop playing GTA or not, your mom is an awesome lady who got you a laptop and was deeply thinking about you, she did the absolute best she could with the information and knowledge she had. She even went to someone to ask for help which is all a human can do.\n\nGive your mom a big hug and a think you, she loves you very much and you are lucky to have her as a mom.\n\nGoodluck random human!!",
  "Great specs for a laptop it will run it for sure. You can always look up the minimum specs for the game when you’re in doubt btw",
  "It’s a nice laptop W moms",
  "Probably on low video settings. \n\nThe lack of GPU will hurt it, the rest of the specs are decent.",
  "Yes, with low settings it'll reach maybe 50fps?",
  "Yes but I would never buy an IdeaPad",
  "GTA can run on a potato, just don't expect to get the ultra level settings. It will be quite enjoyable once tweaked.",
  "love ur mom bro.",
  "Get something with a descent gpu. Integrated is mostly trouble and will underperform.",
  "Buy a game console make your life easier.",
  "Gya v is pretty old and should run decently on that",
  "I was running Sims 3 on Intel Celeron which was almost as old as the game itself. Yes, it was absolutely impossible on paper. So I would give it a shot",
  "brother you can pretty much play V on mobiles now",
  "On a box, no.",
  "a bit better than a ps3, but worst than a ps4",
  "I wouldn't probably expect much past 20-30fps on low. But you could try. It shouldn't crash",
  "Lenovo 4L",
  "Just please, for the love of all that is good in this world and your sanity, give up now on playing GTAO... It's completely unplayable on PC due to script kiddies and their damned cheat menus. 😮‍💨",
  "You very seriously can play damn near anything on low setting with onboard graphics nowadays. Pretty impressive little things. You won’t be getting crazy FPS on any settings, but you will be able to play it.",
  "Sell it for a cheap gaming laptop",
  "If it gives you issues on lowest settings I recommend  looking into disabling shadows completely, just requires you to edit an xml file, and I remember it taking the game from choppy 19fps to a solid 35-40ish on my old laptop.",
  "Integrated GPU and 16 Gb ram? Probably no. It will struggle a lot because windows will eat a lot of resources.",
  "You can run GTA V on a toaster.",
  "yeah it can run 4k 120 fps 144hz ultra settings ur good to go",
  "Unlikely",
  "Yeeeah.\n\nNot on insane settings but should run just fine.",
  "It's worth trying. My first laptop was a shitty little Toshiba satellite that I got in 2013 with an i3 and 4GB of ram. It ran most older games ok and could run some newer less demanding games. I just had to crank the settings all the way down.",
  "If you have Problems you could try eGPUs for Laptops. With this your Laptop gets a near a Gaming PC at this Specs. Maybe your next Upgrade? With a RTX mounted you could pla the new Indiana Jones Game.",
  "It can definitely run GTA V. But I hope your mom didnt pay alot and you don't expect to play more graphics intensive games in the future cuz it won't run.",
  "I play fortnite at 60fps on a much worse cpu. Its fine. Go message u/DarkTower7899 , he helped me get from unstabel 30fps to 60fps. And also go check out r/Craptopgamingadvice",
  "Yeah. I ran it on a athlon with vega 3 graphics. 1080 low got pretty smooth frames",
  "You can run doom for sure!",
  "No",
  "expect 30 fps at 1080p low,You can max out textures and drop to 720p for 50fps,I know you shouldn't but ask your mum if you can return the laptop for something with a 5500U or 5600U,It will be quite a bit better in gaming and probably cheaper than the i5 as well",
  "Yes it will run, some people here are so disassociated with the real world its insane. More than half of the pc gamers would be happy to run a game on a window at 800x600 just to hit 30 fps, especially if you are tight on money. Your mom is really cool, appreciate the gift and be a great son to her.",
  "Ram is non upgradable so good that you have 16gbs but if you struggle with space you should have second slot as I see at spec page so you would be able to fit in second m2 ssd to have more space if it would be an issue in the future. Having more there 80% of ssd filled can cause system slowing down a bit so its good to have spare space for it the bare minimum is 10gb to keep windows stable.\n\nNot the gaming beast but solid laptop for daily use. GTA is and old game and should run pretty decent to be playable though on this newer intel chips. Newer games will strugle or even not launch but steam has 2hour refund policy so you can install it and refund immediately if it would be hassle for your device to run it.",
  "The only concern I would have is the integrated graphics, but other people say it can run fine!",

  "I mainly use my system for editing content and while I do have GTA V on steam does it allow me to use mods. I see a lot of cool add-ons with the modified version. Can anyone guide me to a link for beginners to play with mods?",
  "yeah 60 fps easily go for it just keep the laptop elevated to regulate temps",
  "Not on high settings.  MAYBE on medium settings with NO shadows.",

This comparison is equivalent to saying that because a game runs on a GTX 1060 it will run on integrated Intel graphics. \n\n\nThis machine has 16gb of RAM, only 4 will be dedicated to the very weak on board GPU. That's not enough vram for GTA 5 and the GPU would bottleneck anyway, even with enough vram. 720p30 is not a pleasant experience which was the point of my initial reply. It WILL work but it will NOT be a good experience. GTA:3-SA will run perfectly, GTA4 would be lucky to hit 20 fps and GTA 5 will barely hit 30 in open areas.

I'm considering a Thinkpad, even if with a less powerful CPU, but I haven't seen the newer generations, they may just as well not be the same quality as the older ones...",
  "Hi,\n\nYes, I ended up buying it because I could no longer bear all the browsing and comparing and reading reviews... :)\n\nI had used Thinkpads before, and a year ago I had bought the Ideapad 1 for my daughter to use as her first laptop in school, so I was not totally unfamiliar with Lenovo laptops.\n\nWhat can I say, it is kind of what I expected, build quality seems decent, with an aluminium lid, solid plastic/PCB for the rest of the body, and yes, it is very slim, at least compared to what I had been used to. It doesn't look cheap, I got it in Luna Grey, and it's a very nice metallic color, making it look more expensive than it is.\n\nThe display is the regular WUXGA 1920x1200 which for me is perfect in such a compact form factor (it is a 15.3\" display - which I appreciate for portability, while still offering plenty of space for work thanks to its 16:10 ratio). It is \"only\" 300 nits bright, some people complained about it being too dim for them, but I found it perfectly fine, I use it comfortably at 70-75% brightness (my desktop Dell monitor is only 250 nits and it it is still bright enough!)\n\nPerformance-wise it is as expected from a Ryzen 7 8840HS - snappy in all tasks, it won't get hot with regular office work, browsing, watching videos, etc. So far, so good. The fan only starts with some heavy multitasking, such as downloading and installing a large game while also running online tv in the background and working in Office at the same time... but even so, the fan is not loud at all, you can barely hear it.\n\nI've tested it in some games too, again.. it performs as expected, the integrated Radeon 780M is excellent for \"laptop gaming\", it runs games like Syrim, Fallout New Vegas, etc. perfectly smooth in 1080p (or 1200p for that matter). Of course the very slim case is not optimal for cooling, so for extended gaming, even moderate, I would suggest an additional cooler pad/stand. \n\nOtherwise, I'm pretty happy with it, no issues so far.. if I were to be really picky, I'd say the keyboard could be better, it feels a bit soft for my taste, somewhat rubbery. But the backlight is really useful in dark conditions, and I knew I shouldn't expect a \"Thinkpad level keyboard\". I often work on an external monitor, using an external keyboard, so that is not a serious issue for me anyway.\n\nShortly after I bought it, the price was discounted and I could have gotten the 24GB RAM version instead of the 16GB version, for the same price, but I didn't bother trying to return it and order the one with more RAM, I intend to upgrade it to more than 24GB anyway. I intend to add a 32GB DDR5 stick (in addition to the 8GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard) - a total of 40GB should be plenty for the next few years - the added RAM will really be necessary (especially with the integrated GPU), so I would recommend getting the one with more RAM if you don't plan to upgrade it yourself later.\n\n(I would post photos, but I don't think it's possible here.)",
  "The max it can use is 4GB, I don't think you can change that in BIOS (I don't remember seeing any options related to vram allocation). \n\nIn the meantime I upgraded mine to 24GB RAM (8 soldered + a 16GB DDR5 5600MHz stick). Running Task Manager I can see there are always a total of 20GB available for system, thus the rest of 4GB is reserved for the GPU, which is allocated dynamically in games as needed (you can see all those stats live using the in-game overlay provided by the AMD Adrenalin software).",
  "It's not a heavy duty workstation, it's not meant to be \"overloaded\" with work. For regular office work, for students and even for some light-medium gaming it does work well, it doesn't feel sluggish at all. After all, it is an 8 cores, 16 threads, 5.1 GHz boost clock CPU! And the RAM is DDR5 running at 5600MHz! So it's by no means a slow machine, but you really have unrealistic expectations, what does \"value for money\" mean in this case? The performance of a $3,000 laptop in one that costs $600?\n\nThere are two battery versions available for this model, I went for the higher capacity one (60Whr). Coupled with a low TDP of the CPU (only 28W!), the battery really lasts more than many laptops I owned before.",
  "It depends... which Ryzen 5 CPU? The \"U\" versions of the Ryzen 5 CPUs are cheaper (but also slower, such as Ryzen 5 5625U).\n\nAnd what display? The regular IPS lcd, OLED...?\n\nBut £450 seems a bit expensive, for instance I found this configuration online in my country for about £350 (with further 10% off these days):\n\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15ARP10\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 7533HS (up to 4.4GHz)\n\n15.3\" WUXGA, IPS\n\n16GB DDR5\n\n512GB SSD\n\nI'm pretty sure it does the job for uni, office work, etc.\n\n  \nP.S> Oh, and do go for the highest RAM version (I think they come with a maximum of 24GB), it will help a lot for the future, even if all you do is regular work and study, Windows itself and other software are becoming more and more demanding in terms of memory. The price difference is not that much.\n\n#",
  "Hi, mine is the 60 Wh battery (they larger capacity one) and while I haven't used it exclusively on battery yet, from full to empty, it always shows an estimate of 6-7 hours when I unplug it at full charge. It automatically switches to another power plan for better battery life, which you can adjust further manually for even more battery saving, but I guess it also depends on what kind of work you're doing on your laptop while running on battery and the brightness you set for the display. I'd say you can definitely rely on approximately 6 hours of normal office work, browsing, etc. No gaming on battery, obviously.",
  "I only use it occasionally, when I travel or when I spend the weekend away from home and so. No issues so far, it is (obviously) faster than my desktop's i5-9500 / 32GBRAM and I've even played some games, I happy with the performance and the compact size. I've adjusted the display colors to a cooler temperature as the \"built-in\" blue light protection makes the colors slightly too warm by default.",

  "Hi, the display does show a slightly warm/yellowish tint overall, particularly noticeable with reds - they look somewhat orange, I suspect it's the so called blue light filter built in, but I used the Adrenalin software for the integrated GPU and managed to get reasonably neutral/cooler colors, it now looks similar to my desktop monitor, but if you are a perfectionist, you may need to invest more. But to me, it's not a bad display at all.",

  "I have one but with sadly a ryzen 7 7735hs and not an AI 7 350. But I have all maxed out options.\n\nIt's an absolute BANGER of a laptop. It's very light and thin, build quality is pretty good and the OLED is really bright. \n\nPerformance wise it performs as you'd expect from the specs as far as mine is concerned, but i can't tell for the RAI7 version obviously. \n\nKeyboard is good as well. The integrated microphone is *extremely* good for a laptop, hands down best laptop mic I've heard. I'm running Linux on it, it's very well supported and everything works as expected except the mic which needs a kernel edit to work (I've sent a patch a month or so ago, but i think it got forgotten :/ )\n\nIn the bios you can dedicate from 256mb to 4gb to the igpu. However the bios is fairly limited in terms of what you can do in it.\n\nNow that I know the ryzen ai 7 version exists I'm sad I didn't wait :( \n\nOh and one last thing, at least with mine I bundled a 2year accidental damage warranty for 35€ which is nice, idk if that's still available but it's a nice to know.",

  "Old ones okay maybe if decently priced. Problem are new ones, being super overpriced while offering very little. An example : A mid range T14 G5 with a core ultra 5 125U, 60hz 1200p sRGB IPS display, 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage, which for those two are getting below today's standard, is priced at 1200€. Those are specs you'd find on a 600-700€ laptop, not a 1200€ laptop. At 1000€ you can already get something well built with a Ryzen 7 8th gen, 32gb of ram and 1tb of storage (Asus Zenbook, HP Elitebook, etc). In this case that laptop OP showed was a pretty fine deal, but if you took a Thinkpad for the same price you'd have an E14 Gen 6 with even worse specs.

  "Keyboard's alright. As for the burn in, I think it'll be fine, especially if you don't run max brightness (the screen is very bright, even half brightness is much brighter than most laptop screens) and auto hide taskbar. Bonus point if you use a OLED friendly theme (iirc the O365 suite has one where the background and ui is pure black). Those are only preventive measures and not really 100% necessary unless you're really scared.",

For context, I got a Pro 5i with the Intel 255HX, 5060, and the OLED for $1099 on sale from Lenovo, but paying to upgrade the RAM from 16 to 32 set me past what it'd cost you to get the same machine, just with the IPS screen.\n\nAnd as nice as the OLED is, not having to worry about burn-in is a fair compromise - up to your personal preference and how you plan to use the laptop.",

I’ve looked into several options, and the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 seems like the best choice in that price range. I’m interested in hearing about other people’s experiences with this laptop: how is the battery life, is it fast enough? The screen has an IPS panel, so I don’t think it's too bad in that regard. I need the laptop mainly for studying and everyday tasks, and it's important to me that it lasts for 4–5 years. Do you think this laptop is good enough, or should I consider some slightly better and more expensive options? Thanks in advance!",

Getting 4-5 years out of any laptop is pretty hard without REALLY taking care of it.",

The screen is okay but nothing special, and the outdated Intel processor struggles with multitasking and gaming. Slow Wi-Fi and limited ports only add to the frustration. For the price, it feels like too many compromises were made, making it a tough recommendation. If you want a budget laptop, there are better options out there that don’t feel this sluggish or cheap. Definitely not a laptop I’d want to rely on daily.",
  "Yes, the screen is 45% NTSC, but I don’t pay too much attention to that because of my limited budget. What matters more to me is that it has good memory and a good processor. The other laptops I’ve looked at in this price range have TN screens, which are much worse.",

I’m so confused on what to get and was hoping for some help. \n\nP.s I don’t really upgrade tech that often. I use the same thing for like 5-7+ years",

Istg the only deciding factor here is the price, I could get the Lenovo for much cheaper but am I gonna pay for choosing the cheaper option long term?",

  "Okay I'm a CS grad as well, with industry and research experience so let me give you my opinion on this. \n\nThe nix shell or the posix shell is better yes and you'll be better suited with it, but considering budget and pragmatism,  you can also use windows subsystem for linux or wsl. So right now, the main deciding factor for you should be which os you're more comfortable with? Hardware specs are one thing but if you have to sacrifice years of workflow and familiarity it's not worth switching. So if you're on Windows now, stay on Windows. If you've been on macOS, stay on macOS. \n\nAnd obviously cost is a no brainer. If you want more bang for the buck and the Windows machine does your job, why not? \n\nP.S. - 32 GB should make it a breeze to run WSL as the underlying VM takes up about 4GB and you can shut it down when you don't need it.

I also wanted a number pad for work and IT related stuff, but wanted to stick around the $1000-1200 range.\n\nThe Ideapad Pro 5i is like the Yoga Pro 9i but with much better battery life (can’t do iGPU only with the Yogo for some reason) but also less quality speakers.  The Ideapad trackpad is smaller, too. But I tried the Yogo Pro trackpad once and it was way too big for me. It got in the way and I didn’t like it. Other specs are basically the same. Variable refresh 2880 x1800 OLED with high color accuracy and decently bright at 500 nits. It also only weighs 3.8lbs. My M2 15” MacBook Air that I’m giving to my son only weighs 3.3lbs. So this is about as close as I can get and still have a full size keyboard and GPU on 16” screen. I also wish it was a matte screen and not glossy, but I can get a screen protector for that.\n\nAnyway, Just wanted to let folks know it is on sale the cheapest I can find anywhere at Costco today only. $999 down from $1599.

It's not necessarily HARD but let me guide you through the broad strokes.   \n\n\nFirst - turn the fucking thing off and get the bottom off, disconnect the battery ASAP. Not joking. Get it off power asap as any conductive liquids are burning up traces and causing rapid oxidation of everything in there.   \n\n\nGo to ifixit, find your model, and start disassembling. Make sure you have the correct drivers to get all of the various screws out.   \n\n\nTake pictures of your progress if you've never disassembled something. Having a magnetic pad to place the screws on and label them is a godsend for this kind of thing.   \n\n\nAnticipate replacing the \"top plate w/keys\". That's the part you're looking for there. Try and find one that's in good shape on ebay or another site like that.   \n\n\nVisually inspect EVERYTHING for foreign objects, oxidation, substances. This is important as you don't want to have to do this all over again.   \n\n\nThere are a TON of resources out there for this kinda thing - but don't count on that keyboard working/feeling/smelling right ever again. If it got into the keys there's a good chance there's a plastic/poly layer between the keys and the mobo, let's hope (there seems to be in most that I've worked on).   \n\n\nSource: I fixed shit like this for a few decades and brought all SORTS of stuff back to life by being patient and meticulous.",

  "Sounds like my moms house! Had to go back for a year last year because of unfortunate circumstances. I’m just getting over the sick after 3 months of being out. $400k house in a pretty decent neighborhood, infested with roaches and termites, covered head to toe in trash and unused furniture that “will have a place soon.” Roughly 10 months ago I fell through the floor of my (autistic and epileptic) younger brothers room. I was ok because I just fell into the foundation so it’s not like I fell through a floor like what you see on tv lol. It’s a miracle he didn’t have a seizure in there before then. They still haven’t brought anybody in to inspect the beam in the foundation because they can’t get the place clean. Not even the front end of the house where the room is located!! They can’t clean 3 rooms a bathroom and a hallway and keep it clean for a week so they can bring the inspector in; the inspector who will tell them weather or not the house is even safe to keep living in. She’s had roaches since ‘09 since we moved to this state. We started in an apartment with them then they came with us to the house. She’s tried “everything” except throwing away all the trash, ridding of books that haven’t seen the light of day in YEARS (she’s a teacher so she “needs all of the books she has” but probably has hundreds of thousands of books laying around, all of which getting more and more caked in roach gross over the years), she hasn’t ever tried bringing in a pro cleaner; not that I want to subject anybody to that hellscape, but she has horrible asthma and other disabilities that prevent her from cleaning in that house for long, the house gave me chronic bronchitis and I also have a muscle related condition (muscle spasms, joints buckling under normal weight, dislocations, subluxations, easy to accidentally overstrain a muscle doing nothing) that prevents me from working there long as well, my dad is a disabled military vet and my 2 youngest sisters have dropped out of school to be chronically online Roblox/Minecraft/genshin assholes who can’t even be bothered to wash their own dishes. My brother is the cleanest one of them, I’ve never seen his room unclean. All of us who have lived in that house for years have been sick for years. So over the last nearly 15 years it’s just gotten worse and worse and worse over there with no help and no light at the end of the tunnel. Oh did I mention she has 11 cats and 1 dog and 1 puppy? 3 of the cats are mine and I’m rescuing them from her soon, but I can’t take them all and I can’t call animal control because she has threatened to blackmail me if I do, telling me she knows she is doing wrong. To get AC to take it seriously I’d need to tell them details only I’d know and my mom has threatened me, my friends and friends family with blackmail should anybody report her. She has also been lying to the county school district and has been submitting fake school work in my sisters name to keep her “homeschool” status clear but my sister (dropped out 9th grade would be 11th grade now) doesn’t do the work. 90% of the time it’s my mom using some of her students work and editing my sisters name on it. My sister gets to do jack all and has to watch a Kahn academy video like once a month when my mom remembers to tell her to. I know this because I also dropped out (but did it right and got into alt school within a couple of months) and she tried to do it to me and I said hell no I’m not letting you do that I’ll do my own work. My sister desperately needs therapy because she has such bad anxiety she refuses to leave the house because she is afraid everybody is looking at her and judging her or making fun of her. That’s why she stopped going to school too, because she for some reason was always late to class and when she was late to class everyone would turn and look at her when she walked in. It’s horrible but my mom coddles her and tells her it’s ok and “she’ll figure it out.” Terrible really. It really is the upper middle class-holes that live like this….(not all of em ofc but ya get the point)\n\nMy sisters once broke both of their laptops by dropping them. My mom tried to take it to geek squad, but I said no there is probably roaches inside so lemme look cuz I’m a little tech savvy. Turns out they didn’t break them but actually there was so many roaches in it that the fan couldn’t turn so they were overheating, they both just happened to had dropped theirs recent to that and thought they broke it. It’s horrible how unfortunately normal all this crap is. Also can definitely say I will forever know if someone has roaches because the smell is excruciatingly distinct and makes me sick.",

Trash that's been piling up for months, with bugs everywhere.  So many dishes piled up that you can't even tell where the sink is, despite a dishwasher being right there.  Dirty laundry...EVERYWHERE.  Furniture cloth looks like a civil war bandage.  Carpet that looks like it hasn't been cleaned since the Nixon administration, despite the house only being 5 years old.  \n\nYou can smell the BO on these people from 20 feet away, like they haven't seen the wet end of a bathroom in years, and the smell lingers in your own clothes after they leave.

  "Looking at the Lenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 10 AMD (16″) for mechanical engineering + power and gaming use. Is it any good or is there any better? Hey all, I’m in my mechanical engineering program (so lots of CAD, simulation, maybe some rendering, plus general heavy multitasking) and I also have a Mac for lighter stuff, but I’m looking to get a *really* powerful Windows laptop that is also reliable and high quality. My budget is about **$2,000 CAD** (or close), and I’m considering [The Legion Pro 5 Gen 10 AMD (16\")](https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83LTCTO1WWCA2). Specs/options;\n\n* Processor: AMD Ryzen 9 8945HX (16C/32T) in this model. \n* Screen: 16″, WQXGA (2560×1600) presumably, good resolution for engineering/design work. RAM: I’ve upgraded it from 16 GB → 32 GB for $90 (seems like a very worthwhile upgrade for my use-case).\n* GPU: I have two options: stick with the RTX 5060 (the base GPU in some configs) or pay **$200** more to upgrade to the RTX 5070. Specs at a glance: RTX 5060 and RTX 5070 both 8 GB GDDR7 in this model. \n* Other specs: The model supports solid ports (USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, RJ-45) and build looks quite decent.\n\n**My questions to you all:**\n\n1. For my use (mechanical engineering, CAD/simulation, maybe rendering, multitasking, gaming), is the RTX 5070 *worth* the additional $200 compared to the 5060? Will I see meaningful benefits (in CAD/engineering workloads and gaming) or is the 5060 “good enough” and worth saving the $200?\n2. From the perspective of reliability, build quality, brand reputation: how does the Legion Pro 5 line look? Are there known issues (thermals, noise, durability) I should be aware of? I want something I can rely on through my degree and beyond.\n3. Given my budget (\\~$2,000) and the upgrade I’m doing to 32 GB RAM, does the config seem balanced (CPU strong, GPU choice open, RAM done) or am I perhaps over-investing in something that won’t pay off long-term?\n4. Any red flags (in this model or manufacturer) I should check (e.g., warranty, serviceability, cooling, noise level under load, portability/weight given 16″ size)?\n5. Is there any other laptop that is better and more powerful for this price range?\n\n**What I’m leaning toward:**  \nI really want headroom so I don’t feel like I’ve “cheap-ed out” on the GPU, especially since engineering software and maybe some creative work might benefit from a stronger GPU. On the other hand, if the 5060 already handles everything well and the difference to 5070 is marginal (or mostly gaming-oriented), then maybe I stick with 5060 and save $200 (and invest elsewhere maybe SSD, battery, etc).\n\nWould love to hear from folks who have used this exact model (or similar Legion 5/Legion Pro rigs), especially engineers or users doing heavy workloads (not just gaming). I would also love to hear if anyone has any better options that heyve personally owned. Thanks in advance!\n\n  \n",
  "The majority of the computational workloads you will do as a Mechanical Engineer will be mostly handled by your CPU rather than your GPU, the GPU will mostly just be used for making the visual model that you will be manipulating (so not nearly as significant). The mobile 5070 this generation isn't that much more performant than the 5060 either and is still restricted to 8gb of vram. I wouldn't say going for the 5070 would be worth it.\n\nNow, although the 8945HX is a Zen4 CPU rather than the most recent Zen5 architecture it is still very formidable and can easily last you for years in regards to CAD and FEA. As for gaming that is kind of up to you.\n\nYou could technically get better performance in CAD with a competing Intel CPU as those tasks do heavily rely on single threaded performance but the AMD cpus these days will do way more than fine for that.\n\nNow, 32gb of ram is great for smaller to medium sized builds but if you would like to carry this into the future you should go and get a 64gb kit. That's a problem for the future though, 32 is fine for now.",

I got the 16/512 variant for around 2500 SAR (670 USD,around 56000 INR, although it was at 63-65 when I checked Flipkart), although might be a different price in some other country.\n\nBuild Quality - A sturdy plastic build,but I felt kinda unimpressed with it (probably cause I came from a Huawei Matebook,which had a all metal build),but nevertheless for this price I'm not complaining much\n\nScreen- The anti glare coating is really helpful,and it does remove a lot of the glare on screen,and what else it's your regular IPS 1080p LCD panel. Pretty average,60 Hz,but it gets the work done.\n\nKeyboard - It comes with a full size keyboard ( with a number pad),and for me,keys felt a bit congested,I was just constantly pressing the wrong key( or I might have just big hands lol),but once you get around that the keyboard feels really solid.\n\nPerformance- Fantastic performance, for office works ,notes, school or college stuff,(I wrote some exams in this too), integrated graphics so not much gaming possible ,but I did get around 180 fps in valorant, although I mostly limit it to 65 fps to be easy on the CPU and so it doesn't overheat. You should be able to do some light gaming with no problems.\n\nBattery - I mostly have my charger around so I don't have much concern about the battery. For an H series CPU I'm not complaining about battery. When I do just basic tasks ,I always set it to battery saver ,and it does last me around 6-6.5 hrs\n\nSome Nice to haves- This one came with a fingerprint reader, feels pretty snappy.",
  "Thanks I finally saw a review! So how is it now? Are there any issues?   I’m planning to buy it tomorrow , it’ll be my first laptop. I’ll use it for my school, programming (lots of multitasking) and light gaming ( Roblox only)\n\n I honestly don’t know much about laptops, but the fan shouldn’t be too loud, right? I saw a comment saying the fan runs loud—do you think it’s really noisy, or only when gaming? \nThe model btw is slim 3i 15irh8, tho there is another model which is slim 3 15irh8 with same specs but higher price, which idk what the difference is..",
  "Hi, I just ordered this one from Amazon for 550 USD but was not able to find much reviews except yours. How is it going for you till now? ",
  "Thanks for the review, I couldn't find any solid review about this specific laptop",
  "You should do a long term review of this laptop.\nI am also planning to buy one. Is it the best in this price range or should I buy another one?",
  "[deleted]",
  "Hi bro,Is it possible to do light gaming like valorant,I know you said 180 fps,but what about right now,long term is it fine?",
  "Is it good for a student in computer college?",
  "Can we do editing on it and play gta 5 bro ? Pls test gta 5 once 🙏",
  "Hi, I’m interested in buying this laptop, but I’m concerned about whether it feels cheap due to the plastic materials. The processor and RAM seem excellent for the price, so I’m wondering if they might have compromised on something else to keep the cost low?",
  "Can I play games like rdr 2,far cry 6,etc. At least with low settings. \nShould I buy a graphics card. \nFirst of all can I insert a graphics card in it",
  "Hi, can we upgrade the RAM to 32/64GB for this laptop?",
  "I have the exact same computer with the exact same chip and same RAM size and I could say that your review is accurate. Just one thing but I also have it brand new (1 month) but I'm seeing that my battery is dying faster than usual. But still what a nice coincidence!",
  "Ideapads' body being plastic, have u experience any issues with its hinges? Overheating issues? Trackpad? Pls do answer, I'm planning to buy ideapad slim 3 myself, thank u",
  "Thanks a lot for your review\n\nI am considering to buy this laptop\n\nDo you still recommend it ?\n\nI am comparing it with \nDELL LATITUDE 5450 INTEL CORE ULTRA 5 512GB SSD 8GB RAM INTEGRATED INTEL GRAPHICS 14\" INCH FHD - GRAY\n\nWhich have an Ethernet port (which is important for me)\n\n\nAre you using a dock station with your IdeaPad slim 3 ?",
  "Que ha sido lo más pesado que has hecho con ella sin considerar cosas que impliquen gpu como juegos.. Pura cpu.. Es que quiero ver si me sirve para producción musical semiprofesional",
  "Hey what about the hinge? Are they like typical \"lenovo hinge\"? Hows it holding up? And is your model is IdeaPad Slim 3 15IRH8 ? Do lemme know",
  "Its still holding up pretty well for me, everything feels like a breeze, besides the issues i've mentioned,(as a reply to another comment in this post), nothing much. If your tasks are CPU intensive, then yeah it should be pretty fine, it does pretty well for me.\n\nYeah, my unit's fans only run loud when gaming, although some other people did experience their fans running loud all the time. I'm not sure.\n\nIn my region, these are actually the same model.( idk why the different names)",
  "Hey, hows the laptop holding up now?",
  "hi it's still going pretty solid for me, battery lasts for like 5-6 hrs(YouTube and getting some studies done), performance is still good,the fan sometimes starts spinning even if I'm not doing much intensive tasks (prolly cause I set it to intelligent cooling mode)",
  "Some minor issues I would say would be:\n\n1. The trackpad sometimes ghosts a bit( i.e it feels like the cursor is catching up to you, rather than moving instantly),but it only lasts for like a min. and also I mostly use an external mouse ,so personally i didn't feel it to be much of an issue.\n\n2. The laptop crashes rarely when I play valorant on it, although i think its more of a vanguard anti cheat problem rather than the device problem.\n\nBesides these problems, so far this laptop is holding up well.\n\nIs it the best in this price range? Depends on your needs. You could get laptops with a better display, but the CPU mostly will be from the Intel or Ryzen U series, or you can get a Matebook which has an all metal premium build, but it comes with the core i5 rather than core i7.",
  "Did you buy it?",
  "Yeah,same case for me too. But when I set it in battery saver or run it on charge it's quiet so I think it's a software thing",
  "Yes, so far it's running pretty smooth for me,but like I said,I limit it to 60 FPS coz it's a 60 Hz screen,and it goes pretty easy on the CPU. I still get around that 165-180 FPS range.",
  "I really don't know,coz I never used it for those.",
  "I don't have GTA 5 bro(but some people tested the i5 version of this laptop and ran gta 5,it ran smoothly in low-med settings)..its good for editing works...",
  "For me its holding up really good, the build feels very sturdy. I think Lenovo cheaped out on the materials to keep the cost low",
  "If you are focusing in gaming, then I won't suggest this laptop. I never tried it for RDR 2,FC 6(If i remember correctly,you need to lots of graphics tweaks to get a decent experience). You cant install a GPU. You should be able to get better alternatives than this laptop, especially during sale.",
  "Hello, If i remember correctly you can't upgrade the ram as its soldered on.",
  "Well it's been quite a while since I'm using it,and I did notice quite a dip in battery,but also I only to charge it to 80 percent so there's that..",
  "so far, no issues with hinges, still going strong,no overheating issues too. Trackpad has that random ghosting feeling but doesnt occur much.",
  "Hello, I currently don't use a dock station,and your model I think has the U series processor,so I'm assuming you want really good battery life,so for that I would suggest go for the Dell. (also it would really help to get the 16 GB ram version,or upgrade it to 16 GB in the future, because of much ram windows consumes while idle)",
  "besides gaming, nothing that much demanding on cpu.",
  "The hinge is holding up well for me,so far no issues with it..Yes it's the 15IRH8 model.",
  "Hello,the laptop is still holding up well for me,running like the same it was from day one,lost a bit of battery (95 percent battery health when I checked in the lenovo vantage software),besides that still very smooth and fast.",
  "Is it good for reading charts with multiple tabs open?",
  "So would you recommend it for my engineering studies.\nI have to do coding little graphics related things and watch content?",
  "Not yet.\nI am still confused about what to buy\nShould I buy a gaming or a professional",
  "[deleted]",
  "Ok bro thnx",
  "I'm kinda late, but I'm also seeing quite a performance dip (possibly a bottleneck) compared to what has been 1-2 months ago, so i might consider getting a macbook soon, and this computer will probably be like a spare",
  "I honestly don't care about the battery life\n\nMy laptop is plugged in most of the time and i use an external monitor so it doesn't matter to me\n\nThe reason i chose dell is for the build quality and the Ethernet port\n\nBut i think the Lenovo IdeaPad slim 3 would be faster\nI am just concerned about the durability\n\nAfter 5 years, will the IdeaPad slim 3 hold up or fall apart",
  "Great, thanks!",
  "hey, im planning to get one this week, the 14\" model, performance seems impressive, but i wanted to know hows the hinge and thermal management? aswell as battery",
  "I'm assuming it's a CPU/ram intensive task,in that case yeah should be able to do it fine..",
  "For watching content, yeah it should be fine\n\nFor graphics and coding, I don't know cause I never used it for those.",
  "Did you buy?",
  "I was also thinking of buying this laptop but is it really that loud?\nI think I'll do some typing works only and I have to do some research too so I will be opening multiple tabs in browser might also do some light gaming. What do you think should I buy it?",
  "Oh, for me,so far,I've had no issues with the build quality,it has been going very strong for me,if you do the occasional maintenance,(say cleaning the fans and vents),the ideapad will last very well.",
  "The hinges and thermal management as well is still holding up strong..the battery I noticed there was a slight dip ( lost 5 percent of it's capacity and it's been a year now,so it's pretty normal), besides that going really good for me",
  "For your uses, then yeah its a good pick, but you can find better alternatives, especially during Christmas . My unit's fans only run really loud when i play games.",
  "So you open the back and do that cleaning every now and then?",
  "Nah,I just bring it by a store,and let them clean it,maybe like every 6 months",
  "Ah ok\n\nThanks a lot Man, i guess i will be going for it",
