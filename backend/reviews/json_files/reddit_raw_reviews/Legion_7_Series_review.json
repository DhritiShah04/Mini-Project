  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Legion 5 Gen 10 vs 5i vs Alienware 16 Aurora vs 16 X Hello everyone,\n\nI'm going to study abroad soon and I need a laptop that can do it all. I made a pre-selection which seemed interesting in terms of quality and price but I will need advice to be able to decide because it is the first PC at this price and with gaming characteristics that I am going to buy. \n\nSo here are the characteristics of the 4 computers that I selected: \n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 (15' AMD)\n-AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 (or the 260?)\n-ram 32go ddr5 600MT/s (2x16go)\n-1TB ssd m.2 2242PCIe Gen 4 TLC\n-15.1’ (2560x1600) OLED screen, 500nits, 165Hz\n-nvidia 5060 8gb \n-80Wh battery\n\nPrice: between 1480 and 1520 (varies depending on the processor)\n\n-Legion 5i Gen 10 (15’ Intel)\n-Intel Core I7 14700HX 14th Gen \nSame specifications as the one above\n\nPrice: 1490\n\n-Alienware 16: \n-I7 240H series 2\n-Nvidia 5060 8gb\n-32gb of ddr5 memory (2x16gb)\n-ssd 1to\n-touchpad\n-16’ screen 2560x1600, 120hz, 300cd\n-60Wh battery\n\nPrice: 1199 instead of 1499\n\n-Alienware 16X\n-Intel Ultra 7 255HX\n-16GB of memory 2x8GB\n-240Hz screen\n-96Wh battery \n-the rest similar to the one above \n\nPrice: 1449 instead of 1699\n\n\nMy priority is that the computer can: \n\nHold a day of classes without playing video games.\nA screen with perfect quality.\nBeing able to support any video game.\nBe as quiet as possible (except when playing video games where I expect noise).\n\nFrom what I have read, the problem with the Legion equipped with the i7 is that it consumes a lot of energy even when you are not playing video games because it is not optimized to be on a laptop (I saw between 3 and 5 hours of autonomy). Conversely, the AMD Ryzen 7 allows you to last 10 hours for office activities but is 30% less efficient on demanding video games. \nAt this point should I invest in an RTX 5070 with the AMD Ryzen 7? \n\nFor the Alienware I saw a lot of criticism that it wasn't a real Alienware but a rebadged Dell, then I didn't see any test on the durability of the battery and for video games I also saw several reviews about it.\n\nWhat do you think? \n\nAnd if you have other computers I can advise you!",
  "Upgrade, or try to fix and/or live with it? [Legion Pro 5 16ARX8] Hey there! I bought a Legion Pro 5 16ARX8 (82WM0006US) just over two years ago. It's been great, but recently it's starting to accumulate some wear/issues and I'm wondering if 1) it's new enough that I should get it fixed and live with whatever can't be repaired, or 2) upgrade to something new?\n\nCurrent issues: \n\n- The screen got damaged when I had the laptop in a checked bag while traveling, wherein there's a faint thin line midway up the screen, which is functional for some colors but shows as a faint blue line for others. I've gotten estimates for repairs, which are always in the $400-500 range. But currently it's fine enough that I can live with it, it'd just be a nice plus to have it fixed.\n- It's been overheating badly lately, and some components haven't been working well. I cleaned out the fans to some improvement, but since the overheating issues, my keyboard sometimes stops working intermittently (usually fixed with a restart).\n- The trackpad mouse has been acting up, but it's probably because I badly reconnected the ZIF connector when cleaning out the internals, and could probably fix this.\n\n\nCurrent specs:\n\n- AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX\n- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070\n- 32GB DDR5\n- 1TB SSD\n- 2 TB SSD\n\nI've been thinking of upgrading to a newer Legion 5 Pro (maybe the new [Gen 10](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-pro-series/legion-pro-5-gen-10-16-inch-amd/83ltcto1wwus1)?) or an Asus ROG Zephyrus, either the [G16](https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/asus/rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gu605) or maybe something more compact for traveling like the [G14](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-3k-oled-120hz-gaming-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-1tb-platinum-white/6613954.p?skuId=6613954&sb_share_source=PDP). Open to other ideas! But the hitch is whether it's worth the $2-3k after just 2 years with the current one...\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading, grateful for any input!",

  "Is Lenovo Legion good compromise?  Hey guys, I am thinking about buying a new laptop since my old one after 10 years of hard work has had enough. I didn't need to replace it earlier since I was allowed to use my businesses laptop for my personal needs however i think it's time to switch to my own latopot. First - sadly I am no longer a heavy gamer, however there are a few games I have on my list I'd like to play, like Silent Hill 2 Remake. Second, for my personal projects I need quite a good CPU that will allow me to perform some demanding tasks like multithread compilation process (compiling eg Linux kernel can sometimes take up even few hours). I was thinking about buying a PS5 Pro (I have previous generations) but tbh I don't like the way Sony seems to follow, so that's not on the table. And third - I cannot buy a stationary PC since I sometimes move from place to another and need to have a laptop with me.\nThe problem is that my knowledge about PC / Notebook components stopped somewhere around the time where NVidia GT760M was good enough for gaming... \nI found a Lenovo Legion notebook with Ryzen 7-8845H and RTX4070 graphic card which at the first glance seems to be quite a good setup, however I am not sure about Lenovo itself since there are many quite contradictory opinions on the Internet, that the GPU may get broken due to the heating problems and so on. Also I rather do not trust official reviews as the reviewers mostly get money for making them so perhaps you could share your opinion. Will this setup be good enough? Or perhaps should I stay away from Lenovo Legion series? ",
  "ThinkBook 16 vs Swift Go for multipurpose everyday laptop? Hi, first post here after reading TONS about laptop brands, multiple reviews, lots of 'best laptop for school' posts, youtube reviews etc etc. Yes, I am a student. I wanted a good laptop that will last a good 3 to 5 years. Im mainly doing lots of word, excel, powerpoint, and have lots of tabs open at once, watching videos. Im also interested in some amateur photoshop stuff. I also will be watching a good amount of movies, and I'd like play some video games. I think if the laptop would support it, I would play newer more demanding games, like Cyberpunk and Alan Wake 2, but gaming is not the focus. If I could at least play games like Witcher 3 and maybe baldurs gate 3, and some emulators for PS2, PS3 and PS4 games I would be happy. \n\nOriginally I bought a Legion pro 7i with the 4080 and intel i9, because I wanted a laptop that could handle most anything and be relevant for years. It seems like a great machine, but i think I made a mistake spending that much money, I'm not a hardcore gamer.. I feel I am wasting money.. so I'm looking at returning it and buying one of these 2 laptops. Please tell me your thoughts and which you would go with considering my needs?

  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",
  "Which should I buy?! I saw these were the best options for under $1500! \nI just graduated basic training for the Air Force now I am in tech school for 11 months. I want to use the laptop for school and for gaming. I also want it to last me for at least 4+ years while I take college classes. If you have any different recommendations let me know!

  "Looking to upgrade from Dell Precision 3510, very specific requirements, help needed :) Hi y'all,\n\nI'm looking for a new laptop to set me up for the next 4+ years. I do software engineering and will be starting a PhD soon with a lot of modelling and simulation work involved, so I need something snappy.\n\nI am located in United Kingdom (UK).\n\nI am looking to upgrade from a Dell Precision 3510 with the following specs:\n\n* Intel Core i7-6820HQ, 4c/8t, 8MB L3\n* 16GB DDR4 2133MHz\n* AMD Radeon HD 8830M dGPU\n* 256GB Samsung PM951 NVMe SSD\n* 15.6\" screen, 62% sRBG, 0.4 black level\n* 84Wh battery\n* \\~3kg combined laptop + charger weight\n* 3 years extended on-site warranty\n\nHere's a review of my current laptop at NotebookCheck (they are my most trusted review site): [https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-Precision-3510-Workstation-Review.169566.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-Precision-3510-Workstation-Review.169566.0.html)\n\nHere are my requirements for new laptop, with explanation:\n\n* 8 cores / 16 threads, 16MB+ L3 cache\n   * I will be doing a lot of multi-threaded work, and I run a lot of software at the same time anyway. Been stuck with 4c/8t for a while now so I want to future-proof by upping my core and thread counts. Same goes for the cache size increase.\n* 32GB DDR4\n   * I find myself hitting around 12GB while developing software at work, and I'll need more RAM in future for working with large datasets for my research.\n* iGPU preferred, dGPU acceptable\n   * I never use the dGPU, it's a waste of weight and energy for me. I don't game, and I don't plan on writing any CUDA code for my research, or if I do I will be running it on a university cluster at that point, not my laptop.\n   * I think most of my specs put me in the gaming laptop segment and so I am willing to take any dGPU if I have no choice otherwise, but it's totally irrelevant to me.\n* 512GB+ SSD with >= 2000 MB/s sequential read/write\n   * SSD is limiting factor for a lot of tasks and I've been stuck with this PM951 at \\~900 MB/s sequential read and \\~300 MB/s write. I know there are way faster SSDs available now like Samsung 970 Evo Plus, with > 2000 MB/s sequential read and write.\n   * I am always running out of space at 256GB, but I think 512GB or 1TB would be sufficient for me.\n* 14\"+ screen, 90%+ sRGB, 0.3 black level or better\n   * I don't have a TV, I watch all my media on my laptop so I want something with good colour range and reasonable contrast/black level.\n   * I am happy to go down to 14\" which would help with weight and power consumption without being too small. I think 13\" would be a bit too small for me though. I am happy to go larger as well, I know there are 16\" builds available now, but I need to weigh that against the weight and power consumption.\n* 80Wh+ battery\n   * I do use my laptop unplugged a lot and I know the battery will wear down over time, so I want to get large capacity to set me up with \\~10hrs runtime, which I expect to run down to \\~5hrs over the next 4 years.\n* Max. 3kg combined weight, <= 2.5kg preferred\n   * Heavy laptop sucks for portability. As long as it's no more heavy than my current laptop plus charger, I can survive, but I'd love to get something lighter.\n* 3+ years extended warranty option, on-site preferred\n   * Obviously my laptop is incredibly important to me so I need a good warranty in case it breaks. On-site is preferred because then I can get it repaired ASAP.\n\nBased on this I'm thinking I'm looking at gaming laptops, although I don't care about the dGPU at all, and would prefer iGPU if possible. Given the 8c/16t requirement, I think I am looking for either an Intel Core i7-11800H, or an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H.\n\nI've found a few options but UK availability is terrible:\n\n* ASUS TUF Gaming A15 (AMD) or F15 (Intel)\n   * Not available from ASUS directly yet in UK\n   * Not sure how to get extended warranty unless I buy it directly from ASUS\n   * No on-site repair option\n   * Max 16GB, need to upgrade manually, not sure it it comes as 2x8GB or 1x16GB\n* Lenovo Legion 15/16 Pro\n   * Lenovo do extended on-site warranties, yay!\n   * No options on Lenovo site to upgrade to 32GB\n   * Some models have lower capacity battery\n   * Options are changing constantly and they never seem to have the right model for me: some days there is one in stock, next day no stock, really hard to actually pin it down and get something in my basket :/\n* Dell Inspiron 16 Plus\n   * Dell do extended on-site warranties, yay!\n   * NotebookCheck review said the performance wasn't as good as other laptops with the 11800H: possibly bad cooling design?\n      * [https://www.notebookcheck.net/Almost-an-XPS-16-Dell-Inspiron-16-Plus-7610-laptop-review.553819.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Almost-an-XPS-16-Dell-Inspiron-16-Plus-7610-laptop-review.553819.0.html)\n* HP Omen / Victus series\n   * The new series with the 5800H and 11800H are not available yet in UK, been waiting for ages for these. Haven't even seen a review yet, although I heard good stuff about their Ryzen 4800H laptops.\n* XMG/Schenker\n   * Based in Europe, so I'd have to pay import duty, and then RTB repairs will take a long time (and then would I have to pay duty again? :/ )\n\nAt this point I've been eyeing the options up for a while and I'm not sure what to do. I know Intel are launching the 12th gen Alder Lake chips in Q4, which I hope would cause manufacturers to shift gear about availability of some of these models I am interested in (and hopefully bring prices down as well). But it kinda feels like some of these laptops will never see the light day in the UK. D:\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. What other makes and models should I be looking at?\n2. Do you think any of these unavailable models will materialise before the year is out?\n\nThanks for your help!",

  "Unhappy with Legion 7, any other recommendations? I recently got myself a Lenovo Legion 7 pro, and it just doesn’t work for me. I’m going into university next month, and I wanted something that could handle demanding games while also being good for my education. The legion seemed nice to me, high quality and it was very high performing. I got the RTX 5080 with the intel 275HX.\n\nThe problems are that it’s ridiculously heavy, it’s shaped like a square, and the battery life is abysmal. That wouldn’t be the biggest issue if the charger didn’t as much as a literal brick, but it does. Together, the laptop and charger weigh almost 10 pounds…\n\nAre there any other laptops out there that can perform somewhat close to the legion that will last all day and not give me back pain? \n\nThanks for the help!",

Still limited to around 140W though. This pick makes more sense for a 5080, but give yourself a month spare in case you need to RMA.\n\nAlso --- you can power the laptop with a USB-C charger for school use.",

  "Confused over CPU selection between i5-12450H on MSI Thin & Ryzen 5/7 (7***HS) on ASUS TUF with RTX 3050.

My friend laptop MSI got replaced because it was under warranty. ASUS customer service is great here at India. So, had to move to ASUS TUF models\n\n Now, I am confused whether to go for AMD Ryzen CPUs on ASUS laptop at 60-62k price or for Intel CPUs on MSI (I will extend warranty for its customer service).? Only if Ryzen 5 or 7 (7\\*\\*\\* HS variant series) is great enough in comparison to i5-12th gen CPUs. \n\n After all, ASUS TUF is selling Intel CPU i5-12th gen at higher price than AMD Ryzen CPUs with other specifications same. So, Intel CPUs will be of course better than AMD Ryzen series.\n\n I am adding another flexibility & open for any recommendation for specifications change, series/model change like shall I get MSI Cyborg with i5-13th gen or consider i7 CPUs or any other GPU or a budget increase. Now, the prices have dropped at online stores due to festival offers here at India. \n\n And, my graphics usage exclusively may be for DaVinci Resolve might create a problem but then I am okay if its in this budget to use Adobe Premier Pro, Filmora or Shotcut.",

There is a huge market for laptops and many people are overwhelmed with their choices. This post will help you choose a laptop with decent specs, however it will not be indicative of things like build quality and warranty. Let's make a few things very clear right off the bat.\n\n1. Use caution when buying anything online.\n2. Never buy from Temu. Among many reasons for that, Temu is China. Literally just China.\n3. Laptops are expensive. Sorry.\n4. One brand can have great super high end laptops and at the same time try to sell you e-waste like it's a bargain. This is why I cannot recommend certain brands. That's a whole book's worth of information.\n5. There is no perfect universal laptop.\n6. Ask a question I haven't addressed here and if I deem it worthy I will post info about it here.\n7. I want to hear if you got a good laptop based on this post, please and thank you. This is to improve my future posts.\n8. If you are nervous about buying online, try going to a Best Buy. That's an (American Big Box Tech Retailer) tech store. Do be aware that they will try to sell you a computer like a car dealer tries to sell you a car. They will help you. If they don't, well...\n9. If you want to ask anyone for tech advice, you gotta realize that it is work. It's work. There is no secret formula to get you the perfect device.\n10. Specs are one thing, but build quality and actual performance are another. Some laptops will break really easily. Some 5KUSD laptops break easily because they use plastic hinges. Acknowledge that not every tech person has handled and used for 5 years every laptop that has come out of the market. We cannot predict failures such as these. \n11. If you ask me for any advice, take it with this in mind. I will do my best, and I will tell you if something is wildly overpriced, or a scam, or not good enough. However, I would rather you overpay for a great laptop than not have a good enough laptop. \n12. As per expert and enthusiast recommendation, batteries should be replaced around every two years, because all lithium ion batteries will degrade in health and capacity over time. You can alleviate, but in no way prevent this decline by keeping your battery temperature at an acceptable level. Among other things, that is the most simple. Battery replacement can be delayed, but you risk battery expansion (look up spicy pillow syndrome, severe cases can destroy your device, either by chemical or physical means.) and you will live with reduced capacity over time.\n13. If your laptop is slow and clunky, there are some simple things you can do to speed it up yourself. Free things you can do, uninstall programs you do not use, and disable startup programs you do not use. This will free up system resources. You can easily look up how to do this faster than I can type out a reply of: go look it up yourself. You can also clean out your laptop. This is done by opening up your laptop and cleaning away dust and debris. This is especially important with laptops that have a fan intake for cooling. These can get dirty very quickly. The next thing that you can do is shop online for thermal paste. What you can do is you can repaste the chips on your CPU and GPU. The paste I use is Artic MX 4, and it costs around $4-12USD. Very good price. You will find that your computer may already have paste, but it could be old and failing, making your computer overheat. Temperature control is extremely important for computers. You would find it preferable to have your computer reach its maximum performance before it reaches its maximum temperature. You can look up a how to video online to find a step by step video guide on how to repaste your computer. Make sure to include your specific model in your search results. The last thing that you can do, and is also most expensive, is replace your HDD and your RAM. If your laptop has 4GB 8GB of RAM, consider buying an upgrade. Look up your computer model and find the type of RAM it uses. Then buy a lot of comparable RAM that has a higher capacity than what you already have. Don't ask me how to do it, just look it up. If your laptop has a hard drive (HDD), it is likely slowing down your computer a lot. You can purchase a SATA SSD for 20x to 200x faster speeds than HDD. This does not mean your computer will be 20x to 200x faster, but it will surely be a noticeable improvement. This will require purchasing an SATA SSD that matches the size you require, and then also buying a SATA to USB converter. You will then have to download a specialized program to clone your HDD to your SSD. This is a complicated process, but it is worth it for those who want to save a buck. This requires much research and patience. If you don't want to do any of this, or your laptop is simply a potato anyways, then it is time to buy a new laptop. Believe it or not, every laptop has a time where it is wholly inadequate.\n\nWith that out of the way here is information:\n\nAs you read, you will find scattered segments on different topics. Make sure you skim through and make sure something you may want to read about is typed about. \n\nMy friend, if you are wanting to buy a laptop that will last more than 2 years, you will need to spend at least $400USD. Add $100USD for each year. If you are not an experienced buyer, this is a good rule of thumb. Make sure that the laptop can have its battery replaced, as they should be replaced every 2 years.\n\nAs you read this, you will find more information, but this is my general spec advice when purchasing any laptop meant to last at least 2 years and perform optimally.\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5 11th Generation up, Intel Core Ultra 5 up, or Ryzen 5 5600X and up (I am not familiar with Ryzen Processors)\nGPU: (for gamers and professional users) NVIDIA RTX 3070 up.\nRAM: 24GB or more type DDR4 or DDR5 and up. LPDDR is essentially the name for RAM for laptops. \n\nThose are my recommendations for decently spec'd laptop. \n\nCompare two laptops? There is stuff out there. You can test specific parts using UserBenchmark.com or even the whole computer in the same place. Do note that many enthusiasts will stand behind Userbenchmark and others hate it. Alternatives are CPUMark for CPU's, 3DMark for Graphics cards, and Notebookcheck for the more advanced user with the tradeoff of more accurate data.) This only shows data of people testing your exact same computer, it isn't predictive. Take it with a grain of salt. Should not be your primary method of making a purchase decision.\n\nIntel Core i3's are the lowest tier of Intel Core.\nIntel Core i9's are the highest tier, but you don't need an i9 unless you are doing serious heavy lifting with your laptop or any computer.\nAn Intel Core i3 14th Gen can easily beat out a core i9 5th Gen. Generation matters so much when it comes to Intel CPU's.\nIntel Core Ultras are slightly less powerful than Intel Cores, but more efficient. They are also a new technology. \nSnapdragon X or Snapdragon Elite processors are basically really supe'd up mobile phone processors. Very efficient. Still decently powerful. Any Intel Core Ultra or Snapdragon processor is going to be a decent if not great processor. (For those interested in snapdragon processors, please see my segment on it)\nCore Ultra's naming scheme is alot like Intel Core naming scheme. Intel Core Ultra 9 is the most powerful, with Intel Core Ultra 5 being lowest tier (Intel Core i3 is lowest tier for Intel Core Processors). Intel Core Ultra and Intel Core have a difference, but the Ultra in Intel Core Ultra does not mean that they are better than Intel Core. Intel Core Ultra processors are a new type of processor that is less powerful than an Intel Core with the benefit of higher efficiency. It also seems that Intel Core Ultra is to be found with \"AI\" laptops. Intel Core uses more power, but is more powerful. Intel Core Ultra is just a different and newer architecture of processor, but just because it is new does not mean it is inherently better. It is important to note that the Core Ultra Processors manage to have a huge advantage over Intel Core Processors with the sheer efficiency.\nIntel Celeron's are the basic of basic processors. New Celeron's are actually pretty decent, but they are not nearly as good as even an i3. If you see an ad for a Celeron, don't buy unless you want the bare minimum. Just don't. Pentium is slightly better than Celeron, the tier above. Same book as Celeron, just don't. \n\nBelow is some really complex information on the naming scheme of Intel Processors. This can help for fine tuning a decision. You don't have to know this, but it can help. Feel free to scroll past this if you need to.\n\nThe naming schemes of CPU's are created to be as specific as possible, and at a glance an enthusiast can identify the processor, but it is confusing for the general consumer. Let's start with Intel Core Ultra processors.\nLet’s take the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, for example:\nThe ‘Core Ultra’ is the processor’s name.\nThe ‘7’ represents the brand level, indicating the processor’s performance tier. Other tiers include 5, and 9. The higher the brand level, the more powerful and capable the CPU is.\nThe ‘1’ shows the processor series. As new series are released, this number will go up, like in the Intel Core Ultra 9 288V, where the ‘2’ represents a newer series.\nThe ’55’ is the SKU, which isnt important for the everyday consumer.\nThe suffix ‘H’ indicates the processor type, with the H-series focused on high performance for laptops. Likewise, if you see the suffix ‘U’, it means it’s a power-efficient chipset. This applies to Intel Core as well.\nFor Intel Core Processors:\nCore i7-14650HX as an example.\nThe ‘i7’ is the tier indicator. i3 to i9.\nThe ’14’ indicates the generation of the processor. So, ’14’ signifies a 14th Gen processor. Similarly, ’13’ or ’12’ would denote the 13th or 12th Gen processors, respectively.\nThe ‘650’ is the SKU, which isn't important for the everyday consumer.\nThe ‘HX’ suffix indicates the sub performance of the Processor. A \"U\" designation means it's a \"mobile\" chip, meaning less powerful but more efficient.\n\nA little bit more hard to digest information, I promise it gets easier. \n\nSuffix\tMeaning for the letters you will see on the end of some CPU processors for laptops.\nHX\tHigh-end gaming or workstation laptops where maximum performance and multitasking are essential. Keep this one cool, or your going to cook your laptop.\nHK\tFor gaming laptops, unlocked for easy overclocking, which means shoving more power into your CPU to make it perform faster than it's Base level. While this isn't inherently dangerous, you need to keep the processor cool to do this, and it can reduce the lifespan of the CPU, which is going to be far longer than the rest of the laptop anyways.\nH\tHigh-performance laptops for gaming, content creation, or heavy multitasking.\nU\tPower-efficient chips for everyday tasks like web browsing or productivity, designed for long battery life. \n\nGPU's are just as important as CPU's if you want to use your laptop for media creation, gaming, and creation software that is used professionally and not casually. This includes CAD software like Autodesk Inventor, Blender, etc. \nMost popular GPU's on market are NVIDIA GPU's\n3050 minimum.\n4090, you are just being overkill. \n30, 40 is the generation.\n50, 90 is the tier.\nAs a side note, NVIDIA 50 series GPU's are on their way, so make sure to keep an eye out if you are interested.\nDon't expect any gaming or graphically intensive processing without a dGPU, that means a GPU separate from the ones that are built into CPU's. \n\nRAM is going to be the second most important item for general performance other than the CPU, unless you are a gamer and have a GPU. RAM is your computers short term memory. It really needs this so that things run quickly and smoothly. 16GB of RAM is decent, even great today. But in a year, it may not be so. I suggest a 24GB RAM minimum. 32GB is going to be a more common option though. If you absolutely cannot afford the 32GB option, don't panic, but realize that you may get hurt from it down the road.\nIt is important to note that your RAM is the single biggest determining factor in the lifespan of your laptop. The more RAM, the longer it will last (basically). If your computer starts acting choppy or slow, it could be a RAM issue.\n\nAs of current, an NPU (of what makes an AI chips so special) is (to my understanding) a bit of a marketing thing. They do have real use, but it's not anything your GPU cannot do. Industry is planning on having computers natively compute AI tasks, and that is what the NPU is for. Thing is that those chips are the absolute bare minimum, and the reason why is that we have no actual application made for them, yet.\n\nIf you go on Reddit asking me or anyone else to look at a prospective buy, you gotta realize 3 things. 1, we are not wizards. There is no secret formula. 2. We need details. What do you use it for, what games, photos? Every single detail. You got kids? Will it be treated nicely? Every single detail. 3, I can speak for all tech people that we have never tested every single laptop in existence. Some 2-3,000USD laptops suffer from poor build quality. That's real. And the truth is the industry as a whole actually really wants your money. I can only recommend based on specs, but not build quality. As far as I know, Apple products and Microsoft Surface products are the two suppliers where I can confidently say that you will get a premium build quality (almost) every single time, however these devices are also extremely difficult and expensive to repair.\n\nI suggest at least an 8th Gen Intel Core i5 (i5-8200 for example) with at with 12GB RAM as the bare minimum. For more than 2 years, I recommend at least 12th Generation Intel i5 (i5-12200 or similar) and at least 24GB RAM. Intel's latest Generation of Core CPU's are 14th generation. Those are solid chips. Intel Core Ultras are also really good, but you trade the raw power of Intel Cores for more efficiency. AMD chips are not as common on laptops as Intel Chips are, but do not underestimate AMD. Getting an Intel Core i9 anything is overkill. Even for the best of gamers, Intel Core i7 is just fine. Unless you are doing engineering work or have a computer that requires extreme processing power, not gaming power, but processing power, then you get an Intel Core i9. 256GB of storage is just fine unless you want to store your photos and videos on it. 512GB up depending on how much you want to put on it. Another thing to look out for is SSD vs HDD. You can often get more storage with a HDD, but an SSD is so much faster. Also, once your computer shoots it's last electrical pulse, and it will someday, all you have to do to get all your photos back is to take the SSD and have someone clone it. Basically take it to your local computer repair shop, and if you know what you are doing, you can DIY it (if you know what you are doing). In the case of an HDD failure, you may have to spend thousands to get your data back. It's a spinning disk (HDD) vs (in really basic terms) a super fast USB stick or super fast phone storage (SSD). \n\nIt is important to note the difference between RAM and Storage. \nRAM often comes in configurations like 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, and as stated above, is important for doing tasks quickly. Storage on the other hand, requires a part called an SSD (Solid State Drive)(Modern laptops should not have an HDD - Hard Disk Drive - because they are much slower. However, they are supreme in the amount of storage they can hold. You can buy 24TB HDD off the market. Data hoarder?) an SSD that you find in a laptop will typically have configurations of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB. One TB (Terabyte) is equal to about 1024GB (Gigabytes). KB<MB<GB<TB<PB<YB<whytheheckdoyouneedthatmuchstorage Your SSD will hold things like Photos, videos, games, and more. \n\nI am sorry that the market is confusing, it really is. You don't understand the difference, and that's normal, and that's not ok. Kudos to you for reaching out. I highly suggest AGAINST buying from an online retailer unless it is specifically from the brand you are buying from. No refurbished laptops online, big no no, especially if not from 1st party. Often 3rd party sellers buy defective parts for cheap and then slap together a laptop and sell it. You can get a real actual working computer that meets your specs, except it isn't a laptop because the charging mechanism is broken. Don't buy from 3rd parties online. Don't! I have discovered that going to your local computer repair shop is a fairly safe option for buying a decent computer. They can sell refurbished computers, but this time each one has had a specific time dedicated to it. Even going to Best Buy, you are more likely to overpay for a great laptop than you are likely to overpay for a crappy laptop. If you buy on Amazon or online at all, no third party retailers even if the price is 200USD cheaper. You will lose out on something every time. Also make sure the seller is in your region. Let's say you live in USA Asus sold you a nice laptop at a nice price. 2 months later it dies on you. You go to Asus for the warranty. Well. You bought your laptop from  ASUS Germany which serves, idk, Europe. They won't give you the warranty because you live in the US. This has happened before folks and will continue to happen. Buy from the correct region.\n\nElectronics are expensive, if you buy a cheap price of crap, can you really expect it to work like a premium item? \n\nDo not buy Chromebooks unless you specifically know what it is. Chromebooks seem appealing and are very cheap, and the battery life is really good. However, there is a reason the battery life is so good. The stuff inside it is so weak, it needs so little power, that that battery lasts forever. It's not as bad as having wait times so high it negates the long battery life, but you are still sacrificing performance. I have also discovered that Chromebooks are very limited in compatibility. The apps that you use on your Windows computer sometimes cannot be used on Chromebook. Is there a fix? Probably not one that someone needs help buying a laptop can do. ChromeOS is a flavor of Linux Debian, which is another way of saying it's closer to a crappy, not well made android phone than it is Windows, which is highly polished with wide compatibility. That being said, Chromebooks so have a use. They are awesome low end devices. Anything to be done in a browser can be done in a Chromebook, just don't expect much performance from it. I say this because I myself have a Chromebook, and multiple windows devices. Chromebook is gr8 if you are an android person. Also Chromebook is natively Linux, if you are that kind of person who would want to know that.\n\nWindows is terrible with low end devices. Chromebook was created for them.\n\nYou think a MacBook or an Apple computer will suit your needs better than a Windows or Chromebook? Never buy the baseline. Ever. Always go at least 1 tier above the baseline. It's an expensive bullet to bite, but it won't be more expensive than buying an underpowered laptop. 16GB RAM is actually fine with MacOS because it's built differently from windows. However, never expect to do any heavy lifting with a MacOS system unless you pay several thousand USD for a ridiculously locked down device (see upgrading your SSD for new Mac pros that cost a black market heart). What you gain with Mac is the Apple ecosystem, which is honestly great for the average consumer, and you lose on performance and compatibility, along with customization. You can also get locked out of switching to windows, its just more difficult to switch back, files etc. I will say again, never buy the baseline Apple Product, and remember that you will not be able to upgrade it.\n\nI've seen lots of computers and laptops that say starting at x price and the starting at is absolutely terrible. Look above for your minimums. Do they meet?\n\nSame with buying any cheap laptop. Business knows you don't know what you are buying. If you see anything 4GB or 8GB RAM, STAY AWAY!\n\nYou may see on your listing for a laptop that a battery will last 12 hours. If you look closer you will notice an asterisk. Usually, a manufacturer will place a laptop in \"optimal\" conditions and measure battery life under that. Never expect your laptop to reach an advertised battery life.\n\nSnapdragon processors:\nSnapdragon processors are not the new kids on the block. They have silently been sitting in phones for a while now, but recently, they have appeared in laptops as extremely efficient processors. (Important side note here, AMD has come out with its own line of extremely efficient processors, but they can't compare in price, and that is why the Snapdragon processor shines. More on those coming soon.) Snapdragon processors are based off of a different architecture, and so lots of compatibility issues can arise. Expect most video games to not work, so don't get for your kid. You can expect anything that you do in a browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, TOR) to work very well. You may very well go several days with hours on hours of use to go by without the need to charge. This is perfect for people who only use stuff like browsers. They are also often cheaper, but you can fill in that cheap price with nice things like an OLED display or more RAM. They tend to be very light as well. In essence, snapdragon processors are perfect for those that use things like YouTube and Facebook alot, as you access those through your browser. There have been some issues that have come up with snapdragon computers, and this is because they are a new tech. Any new tech has issues. (Self driving cars, first phones, first computers, AI) And any issues are being smoothed out and will continue to get better. If this sounds good but you want to avoid any issues, you can always wait for the next generation of snapdragon processors to come out. The specialists that work on the creation of the processors will have gathered data on issues and fixed many of them by then. No games. Exceptional for browser usage, better than MacBook battery life.\nOn that note, experts have compared a Snapdragon laptop as a laptop that has better battery life and can do more. (Sick burn) While the Snapdragon processor has some compatibility issues, it is still a Windows machine, which is so much more compatible than laptops that have MacOS.\n\nIf you want a real laptop, start with Business class laptops or laptops aimed at businesses. There are many many alternatives, but one name brand business grade laptop that is reputable are the Dell Latitudes, and another is HP Envy, and another is Lenovo ThinkPads. They can be expensive, but it's a very decent system. For the average consumer, they are a good option. Business class laptops are really good buys, because generally, a business will make a deal with a company, say Dell. Dell wants to keep their contract with this business. To make sure that the business does not switch to Lenovo, they have to make a laptop that will not break down and is easy to fix. Business class laptops also tend to have more documentation and manuals available. The business wants good computers that don't break down, and Dell wants to keep its contract. Thus, the business class laptop is born.\n\nGaming laptop for your kid? Anything less than $600USD is a waste of your time. Expect to spend $800USD. If it doesn't have a discreet graphics card, don't buy it. (For serious gamers only)\n\nIf you are looking to buy a laptop with an Intel Core i7 12th generation and are buying it for your kid to play Roblox, it will be just fine. Same with Minecraft Bedrock or Java Edition. Fortnite, on the edge, anything more sophisticated, and your computer will likely struggle.\n\nFor those not knowing difference between Minecraft Java and Minecraft Bedrock, Because Minecraft is hands down, yes you too conservative grandpa, Minecraft is one of the most if not the most influential game of all time, (this is my personal opinion). Minecraft Java Edition is more CPU intensive, needing better CPU, but is also less microtransactions, more moddable, and has your kids Favorite servers (2B2T for that concerning kid). Bedrock still has popular servers (you will get all those mini games like PVP and bed wars) but is more compatible, playable on phone, PC, and console. I prefer Java, but that's my personal brew. \n\nIf you want a laptop for your kid to play games on like Roblox, Minecraft, or Fortnite, you will need to spend at least $500 for an Awesome Parent Worthy gaming experience. \n\nSome good gaming laptop brands: Acer Nitros, ROG Zephyrus, and Lenovo Legions, and MSI.\n\nSpeaking of Gaming, ever heard of a Nintendo switch? The handheld one? Well, imagine that, but it's a windows computer instead. Now imagine that exists. Now stop, because it does. Unfortunately, I am very poor, but if I was granted a wish, I would get the ASUS ROG ALLY X (yes caps needed). It's a super powerful handheld machine for around $800 ($700USD Back Friday). Yeah, it's expensive. It's older brother, the ROG ALLY is going for around $500. It's a neat machine, and you can hook a monitor up to them and definitely use it as a gaming rig or workstation. Alternatives are currently the MSI CLAW or Lenovo Legion Go. For gamers, another alternative is the SteamDeck and the SteamDeck OLED. Very good machines, as in AAA games good machines, take a look if you are interested. Maybe it's just got a gold filter over it with me, but I think it's freaking cool.\n\nFor those looking for serious gaming laptops, try looking for an at least Intel Core i7 12th Generation with an H or HX or K at the end of the CPU model name. These letters indicate the performance. Also recommend at least a NVIDIA RTX 4080 or equivalent as very high performance. You really don't need more than 60FPS for biological reasons, but 120Hz is where your brain basically caps out. 240hz is another very small increment of improvemenr, but not a lot. I suggest a minimum of 32GB of RAM.\n\nFramework is a relatively new company that specializes is extremely customizable laptops, and you can easily buy one framework laptop and have it last as long as you want because you can simply replace the parts. If you are willing to pay extra for great laptop, with customizability, look no further than framework. Before you ask me what to get, how about you do an internet search first. \n\nFor people just looking for a laptop with a really nice display, OLED displays are widely regarded as absolutely beautiful. The blacks are truly black, and that makes for a world of difference in regards to contrast. They can suck extra battery though.\n\nFor those looking for content creation laptops, if you draw or create videos regularly, you should look into an external storage device, particularly an SSD for that durability. I personally have a Samsung T7 and I love it. However you may find others at better prices. Keep in mind that so many listings are scams, it's mindblowing. There are many \"2 in 1\" laptops that people seem to like. Go find one if you need one.\n\nFor those looking for laptops used for coding, you will want a laptop with a decent CPU. For great performance I suggest an Intel Core i7 at least 11th Generation, or an Intel Core Ultra 7.\n\nFor those going into day trading, I suggest a gaming laptop or similar. If you need fast response times from your computer, you need a powerful laptop, because those milliseconds matter. Also consider getting an Ethernet port for direct connection to your router. This eliminates any instability that can occur with Wi-Fi, especially if you live in a crowded area or have many devices.\n\nPeople have asked if Intel 13th Generation processors have issues. They did at one point. In technical terms processors had a fault in their microcode algorithm that saw them request elevated operating voltages from the motherboard. That can cause instability because too high a voltage can wear chips like these out with time. Basically they were misbehaving. Intel and it's partners have fixes this by releasing BIOS updates, so if you have an issue, update your computer. The problem is largely resolved.\n\nI just typed this out, but it didn't save. Ugh!\nIt is important to know the difference between Windows Pro and Windows Home. Often, you will feel that with Windows Pro, you will get a better product. There is one large thing that is relevant to the consumer that you get with Windows Pro. Bitlocker (more on that soon). With Windows Pro, you get the ability to use Microsoft Remote Desktop. A remote desktop allows you to use a computer you own like you are sitting next to it. For example, let's say I am at work, 50 miles away from my desktop at home. With Windows 10 Pro on my desktop, and Home on my laptop, I can log into my computer at home (assuming it is on and set up) and then I can control my home desktop as if I was there. Super cool. Microsoft remote desktop works best (extra config needed if outside home) inside your own network. This basically means you have to be inside the same wifi, home, apartment, building to use  Microsoft Remote Desktop. Alternatives that are also free that I use is Chrome Remote Desktop, and Parsec, and those do not require windows Pro. I can control my computer from anywhere with these. Remember to never give people access to remote desktop on your computer unless you know them. Scammers do this often to steal your money and data. Other features of Windows Pro are better ability to control systems (IT for school or business) and overall many features that are useful for business. I do not remember each and every one because those that I do not remember were not important enough for me to remember. \n\nAnother large feature of Windows Pro that is actually useful to you is BitLocker. Bitlocker is a program that runs on your computer all the time to encrypt all do your data. Your computer is the only computer that can read this data. This encryption is so hard to crack, that the United States Government would have a very difficult (not impossible) time of decrypting your data. Bitlocker will protect your data, but not your device. If your device gets stolen, nobody can read your data (government documents, corporate emails, etc.) If your device gets stolen, you lose the device and data, but whoever stole the device gets only the device, not the data. Because your device is the only computer that can read your data, if your laptop breaks and you want to get the photos off of your SSD, it will be basically impossible to get your data back. It is encrypted and gone. Bitlocker is often enabled by default on windows pro devices. This means that if you forget your password and you have a windows pro devices, you are probably very very screwed. I highly recommend to learn how to get and retrieve your blocker encryption key, this is a 25 character password. I suggest you make physical copies, take photos and also keep a copy where you keep documents such as birth certificates and passports. If you do not want Bitlocker, you can turn it off. Basically your computer will take a minute to decrypt your drive and you won't lose anything, it just removes the encryption and makes it so no encryption will happen in the future. Normal retrievable files and data. I suggest this if you are not worried about having your data stolen, but are worried about accidentally making it completely unretrieveable. \n\nSystems with higher Specs are going to tend to have lower battery life and higher temperatures. This is normal. However, in my opinion, the low battery life can be attributed to the 100WHr limit on batteries, as it is hard to transport these high power density batteries due to regulation. Manufacturers also neglect to meet this line, with some laptops having 86WHr or 56WHr batteries.\n\nA commenter (Intrepid_Passage_692) on this thread and an obvious to me fellow enthusiast also pointed out some great things which I will share here in their own words. ---\"the difference between a 100 and 200 dollar laptop is insane. 400 is the next jump, then 800, then 1200. Laptops get AMAZING once you spend over 1200 bucks. Past 2k is the land of diminishing returns, at that point buy what you want.\" ---\n(USD assumed, 2k means 2,000USD, a buck is a slang term for a dollar.)---\n\"just get core ultra. They significantly outperform core chips up to ~80-100W. At that point, no one worrying about sub 2k laptops will even be able to afford a chassis that can contain a chip going over 100W without thermal throttling. I have to use a watercooled laptop to tame the 14900hx. I am looking forward to core ultra, even if it means I lose 20% performance at *checks notes* 210W...\"---\n(W means Watts. A laptop drawing 60 watts for an hour will draw 60Whr (Watt Hours) from a battery., 2k means 2,000USD, 14900hx is 14900HX, a 14th Gen Intel Core Processor that is Top of the line, thermal throttling is a term used to describe when your computer reaches its maximum temperature before it reaches its maximum performance, water-cooling is a form of laptop cooling that involves water. Works like a car engine cooling system, with cooling fluid being pumped from the engine to a radiator and back. I disagree with Intrepid the discarding of the Intel Core Series. I feel that if the differences were that high, I would hear more noise about it. I am currently and always looking into it.)\n\n\nFor anyone who made it this far, know that my prices are high bars with padding so that people who do the bare minimum of research can just go buy a laptop priced at $500 and actually get a decent device. (For consumers, if you read the last sentence and decided to take off $100USD from your budget based on that, I highly recommend you retract that decision). I myself got a used $600USD laptop for $350USD and I can do pretty much anything with it. The difference between experienced users and everyday consumers is that they don't know how to get great laptops at great prices. That is why this subreddit exists.\n\n\nFun facts that you can skip through:\n1. lithium ion batteries should be replaced every two years\n2. SSD's have a lifespan, this is measured in TBW (TeraBytes Written) it is unlikely you will reach the end of a SSD lifespan.\n3. Snapdragon Processors are found in mobile phones.\n4. Minecraft, especially Java Edition, is more CPU intensive than GPU intensive.\n5. When a SSD writes it's last byte, it tells the computer it cannot be written to anymore, this makes the computer angry. You can restore the data by simply reading it. Take it to a local repair shop. HDD require a much more expensive fix, as they have moving parts that have physically worn out.\n6. Data written on mediums such as CD's (Compact Disks), DVD's (Digital Video Disk's), HDD's, SSD's and more have a lifespan? Data can disappear over time. If you have a 20 year old CD with a song on it laying around, well you don't. \n7. Lenovo is actually in part owned by the PRC. However, the way it's business is structured and the fact they don't sell completely custom parts, means that even the United States government trusts Lenovo to provide them with Servers and server equipment.\n8. Snapdragon mobile processors are popular in high end phones. The new processors you find in laptops are tweaked so they consume more power and put out more performance, but they use the same architecture.\n9. In 2005, AMD's Athlon 64 FX-57 was overclocked to 10 GHz using liquid helium cooling. Breaking 10GHz was a significant achievement at the time, but it required extreme cooling conditions and was not a commercially available product.\n10. A CPU's GHz does not equal performance. Like other computer things, many variables are involved.\n\n\nI specifically did not mention AMD Ryzen because I do not know the AMD Ryzen naming scheme like I do Intel naming Scheme.\n\nFor fellow enthusiasts, if I get something wrong or leave something out, please leave a comment so I can address it, I will not be offended. \n\nI put lots of love into this guide, and I appreciate hearing back from you to find out if it helped, although you are under no obligation to do so. I do not do this for money.\n\nPersonally, as one may be curious to know, I recently decided to temporarily go broke and I got myself an ASUS ROG ALLY X.\n\nThank you for reading, if you feel the need, remember to stay posted as I update this guide very frequently. Next year this guide will be deprecated as I am planning on making a new and improved guide available next year.\n\nVery recently, have created a new Subreddit where I will create guides like this. It is very new. Go to r/TOOsTechTactics and you will find it. I have always wanted to do something like this, your feedback and time have given me the push to start.\n\nIf you have read to this point and would like to see the 2025 guide, basically this guide but updated, please go here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TOOsTechTactics/s/Qw88cYk4GQ\n\n-An experienced person who has made lots of mistakes and learned from them.",

  "Second post in this thread, first of all, great post!!\nTo get into Amd is not hard and very mich rewarding since they make very good laptop cpu's. Most people would even say, better then intel on the last 2-3 generations.\n\nAllow me to extend your post with this info:\n\n\nAmd ryzen laptop cpu:\n\nExample: Ryzen 7840HS:\n\nJust like intel the first number is the gen: in this case 7\n\nJust like intel has the i3, i5, i7 and i9 tier, Amd has Ryzen 3,5,7,9 tier.\nLook at the second number, here 8 means it's a ryzen 9 (higher then 7).\nthe 40 is subsequent tier number.\n\nThe suffix, here 'HS' indiquates the power/hear target. HS is the highest (for enthousiasts). Look online for other suffixes.\n\n\nThen current gen:\n\nJust like Intel (I feel a pattern here) AMD decided to screw the naming schemes and call their cpu's 'Ryzen AI 9 370' Which basically says it's Ai-ready, which only means they have NPU core, it's expressed in TOPS (google the acronym). The current tier is 360, 365, 370 and 375, I'm sure more will come. They first had an exclusivity contract with Asus, that's why most HX 3xx cpu-powered laptops are from asus but lenovo, hp and other brands are starting to offer them as well.\nThose new cpu's are very much focussed on efficiency, just like the new ultra intel cpu's, and good iGpu.",

  "I think 500$ laptops are not enough for roblox/minecraft games cuz, i got a \"gaming\" laptop with GTX 1650 ti and i5 10300h and it's not really good cuz sometimes it just freezes in games.

  "I could use some help. I am looking to buy a new pc, and i will need it to last me a few years, as i will use it for school and probably wont be able to afford a new one as a student. I will obviously be using it mostly for school, more specifically i will be majoring in law. So no crazy applications or tools will be needed. I dont really play video games too much, but will play the occasional civilizations 6 and 7 (when it comes out). Not the most demanding game and i dont mind having to lower the graphics a bit if i need to for it to run smoothly. Therefore im fairly certain that i wont need more than 256GB storage. \n\nI was also thinking 16GB RAM would be enough, but now im not sure. My only problem is that in my price range there arent a lot of computers available with more RAM from what i can see. I was looking at the Macbook 13” M3 16/256, just for the quality and battery life, but if there are better options with perhaps more RAM (if you think i’ll need it) i would love to know. I am from Denmark, so my prices might sound a little steep compared to what i can see on other forums. I can get the MacBook for 1200$, which might sound like a bad deal for people in the us, but everything is more expensive here so. \n\nPlease note that since im from Denmark most American websites like bestbuy or american amazon is either not useable or will come with some hefty taxes, so im not looking for specific deals, but more just a hint to certain models. I was also looking at the Lenovo Yoga 7i gen 9, but i dont think thats better unless i could get 32GB RAM for a similar price to the MacBook, but please let me know if it is.\n\nI dont know if i’ve just written a bunch of useless stuff, but i hope it gives an insight to my situation and needs, and i would be extremely happy if anyone would be willing to provide some insight",

  "Hello! I'm a little bit curious about which processor is better for a laptop with integrated cpu? With U or H letter in the end?

  "Hello !  \nThank you for this great post.\n\nIn advance sorry for my english as it is not my main language.  \nI am myself in search for a laptop.  \nConsidering that i used to have the macbook pro (mid 2015) that died on me I am in need for a new computer.  \nAs I am an architect i'm looking for a laptop that could manage Autocad/Enscape/Sketchup/Revit and the Adobe suite (maybe a little photoshop AI) smoothly but not planning on doing 3Ds or big rendering. I don't play either on my laptop, or at most indie small stuff. For the rest, classic internet use and i watch movies on it (so i'd like a screen that is kinf of suited for that also)  \nI have to say I'm used to Apple design so i would like a laptop that is nicely finished and not a 3kg gamer laptop with neon lights.  \nPrice range would be from 1200 to 1800 euros, could go higher if its definitly worth it.  \nAnd mostly a laptop that lasts at least 5 years given the price..\n\nI wanted to go for the Asus Zenbook 14 (or S 14) :  \nProcesseur Intel Core Ultra 7 - Puce graphique Intel ARC -32 RAM  \nThat goes for around 1300 for blackfriday, bur read that for architectural work i should go for an NVIDIA RTX and that the intel ARC is not great, there is the 15' version with AMD Ryzen 7 and AMD Radeon but I don't know what its worth (1299 euros)\n\nSo maybe the zenbook pro 14 :  \nIntel® Core™ i9-13900H NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4060 (233 AI TOPs) 8Go GDDR6  \nBut goes for 1880 euros and i seem to find it only with 16gb RAM that seems to be a little low\n\nThen there is the ProArt with PX 13 and P16, but the first seems to have a too little screen and i'v read that its only 60Hz (event if i don't know how bad that is) and the second may be way too expensive and maybe too big.\n\nAnd at last the Microsoft surface laptop 7 Snap dragon X elite (12core) 32 RAM also at 1880 but i have no idea how this knew tech works with the software i use.\n\nSo I come for help, even if you may know other products that may be better suited ? I can pay a little much but wouldn't want to spend for overkill specs for my use.  \nI am pretty surpised when i read that some recent spec are bad for autocad or architectural design while i used a 2015 laptop for autocad/Rhino during my studies and don't remember struggling that much..",

  "Thank you for this post - it's very helpful!\nI wonder if you (or perhaps another reader on the thread) can comment about build quality (of course nothing is 100% for sure, but still!) and number of cores.\n\nSpecifically, I am looking at two computers:\n\n[Asus Vivobook S 14](https://www.walmart.com/ip/ASUS-Vivobook-S-14-14-WUXGA-OLED-PC-Laptop-Intel-Core-Ultra-7-32GB-RAM-1TB-SSD-Black-S5406/7447569796?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&sourceid=dsn_ad_67b24a3e-8de0-4c6a-a2eb-385363192ede&veh=dsn&wmlspartner=dsn_ad_67b24a3e-8de0-4c6a-a2eb-385363192ede&cn=FY25-Holiday-GIFT-PMax_con_dps_dsn_dis_ad_xcat_s_n&gclsrc=aw.ds&wl9=pla&wl11=online&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA3ZC6BhBaEiwAeqfvymZYDTNdBAzq54K-ePX6-NeGaIbigDYaKaqaltlRMcBxEQsD4hHEBhoCIiwQAvD_BwE)\n\n[Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 11](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx1/thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-11-14-inch-intel/21hm002fus)\n\nWith sales/coupons they end up a similar price (~1000 USD - I know the Lenovo defaults to showing more on that page, but member sales make it really cheap). On paper, the Vivobook's specs are a touch better (slightly newer processor, twice as much storage (terabyte vs. half), larger battery, OLED screen), and otherwise they're pretty much the same.\n\nMy main questions are:\na) do you have thoughts on the processor difference? (Intel Ultra 7 258V vs. Core i7-1365U vPro). Lots of benchmarking sites say that the ultra is performing better, but it also has several fewer cores and I just don't know if that will be an issue in the long run somehow? This is beyond my expertise.\n\nb) What's the catch with the Vivobook/which is a safer bet? The Vivobook is not supposed to be Asus's premium/flagship line, and yet it has amazing specs for very cheap, relatively. Are they known to fall apart? Hinge issues? Something weird? Is the Lenovo a safer bet given that it's from their flagship line? But also I've heard people say their battery life isn't great so maybe it's not?\n\n\n\nI know I can't have it all, but these seem very, very close to it: powerful machines that are nonetheless very light and portable.\nAt this moment they're maybe overkill for my needs - I'm a social sciences researcher so I do a lot of word processing, I make presentations, excel, sometimes R and other research programs, and mostly I often have a lot of programs open at the same time (think word, a reference manager, Spotify, excel, Teams or similar, and multiple browser tabs). I also occasionally watch shows/movies or do very light gaming (when I have time, which currently I don't), but these are much less critical for me. I prioritize performance over storage - I store the largest segments of my data off of my computer anyway.\nBut anyway, I like having computers for a long time and I'm hoping these will last.\n\n\nNo pressure to give feedback - I think I'm just torn between two very good options, and it's hard to go wrong (but also hard to choose)!",

  "Thanks for all the time you put into this! I'm looking for a new laptop because mine which I had for 4 and a half years just stopped working. I don't use it for work (have one for that) or gaming, mostly just watching shows on streaming services, YouTube, live sports, etc. and then general stuff like google docs and whatnot. Therefore I do not need anything specific on it, I just want one that will last. Do you have any brand recommendations and a minimum price recommendation for something like that?",
  "First things first, I appreciate the effort you gave to make this post. I agree with your reasoning too, teaching people how navigate computers is better than a random stranger spitballing recommendations online. If I bought a laptop someone recommended me and it underperformed, I’d be pissed. This atleast helps give people a scope to realize you have to shell out some cash for a decent laptop. I have a few criticisms/add ons though.\n\n1) I9 started being produced gen 8, not Gen 5. Doesn’t really matter other than there isn’t a single i3 (i5s push it) that’s better than the og i9-8950hk. (8 year old chip btw) \n\n2) ram should take precedent over cpu at this point. 8GB of ram makes my 14900hx perform like a 10th gen i5 with 32GB of ram. It literally dictates how long your computer will last. If you want to use it for more than 2 years, 16gb minimum. If you have a computer with 8gb of ram and it feel like things run slow or choppy, it’s the ram. \n\n3) If you intend on doing ANY gaming, you need a dgpu. 0 exemptions other than sims 4 and games pre 2014. Even Roblox/minecraft on integrated graphics is a terrible experience ESPECIALLY with 8gb of ram. \n\n4) your 3 paragraphs going in detail about the suffixes of intel chips can be condensed into one because 3/4th of it isn’t applicable anymore. If people are buying chromebooks from 2020 with 9250g’s in them they should’ve read the beginning of your post better. The only laptops with g or y chips are Chinese temu shitbooks\n\n5) the difference between a 100 and 200 dollar laptop is insane. 400 is the next jump, then 800, then 1200. Laptops get AMAZING once you spend over 1200 bucks. Past 2k is the land of diminishing returns, at that point buy what you want.\n\n6) just get core ultra. They significantly outperform core chips up to ~80-100W. At that point, no one worrying about sub 2k laptops will even be able to afford a chassis that can contain a chip going over 100W without thermal throttling. I have to use a watercooled laptop to tame the 14900hx. I am looking forward to core ultra, even if it means I lose 20% performance at *checks notes* 210W…\n\n7) I understand why you recommend userbenchmark but notebookcheck is infinitely better, just harder to navigate. If you want to do one better look up 3d mark or cpumark scores.",

  "So laptops on sale for Black Friday, are the pre sale prices inflated at Best Buy?

  "Hi, thanks but I disagree with some things.  \n\nI have CDs over 20.  They still play flawlessly.  The data on a CD is expected to last 100 years.  Longer if you keep them from corrosion.  The data is not magnetic and does not rely upon an electrical charge.  Probably lack a player for playback before the disc goes bad.\n\nMy info says most cheap SSDs will last only 5 years or so before they fail.  Maybe longer depending on usage.  Depends on how much you fill it and how many deletes and rewrites you do.  We'll see in a few years I guess. \n\nCPU Ghz does mean performance.  That's why we have overclocking on CPUs and GPUs.   That's part of why a newer i5 can beat an older i7.  Computationally intensive apps like CAD and even Minecraft will benefit from high Ghz CPUs with great single core performance.  Intel CPUs tend to be better in this than AMD ones.\n\nUS Gov trusts all the spies been in it for decades.  Everywhere from Air Force recruits to US Commanders to US Congressmen like Menendez.  Who cares if they trust Lenova - I don't.  No HP, I don't recommend you either.\n\nLi batteries lose capacity over time but they vary and can still hold 80 percent up to 10 years or more.  Depends on usage.  My laptop is still using a 5 year old battery no problem.  It does not last as long, true.  Probably depends on charge/depletion cycles and the quality of the battery, etc.  They should be replaced when you aren't getting enough usage time anymore.  Hopefully car li batteries last more than 2 years... What happens to all these old batteries?  Where are they going?  Are they toxic?  Does anyone care?\n\nHere's my advice:  1. only buy windows 11 pc's now, 2. laptop ram is not upgradable so only buy one with 16 Gb plus now.  Resist the half priced 8 Gb ones if you work on your pc.  3. Opinions vary but I think Intel i7 14700 is still the best bang for the buck if you do CAD, MineCraft etc.  Leave the Core AI CPUs for later when there's actually some useful AI to bother with.  4. Don't let Windows 11 attempt to update your brand new PC's bios.  The AI and CoPilot are just too dumb to do much of anything correctly.\n\nI just returned my GF's new HP laptop.  Thanks Staples for making it easy.  The laptop was really nice with great look and feel to the hardware but Windows 11 tried to update the bios.  One Drive could not even find its own files and folders.  Anivirus not working warning right at first startup - no antivirus activated on brand new HP laptop - not even Windows Defender.  Popup ads galore every startup.  Do research online just to figure out how to disable all the ads popping up and literally filling the screen with ads.  So back it went.  Just as well, it only had 8 GB ram hard installed when MS recommends 16Gb for its Core CPUs. LoL\n\nGuess what HP and DELL are planning on?  Everyone in the entire world that is still on windows 10 is being forced to get a new PC before Oct 2025.  We're talking billions or even trillions of dollars.  Collusion?  Or just a case of when interests coincide?  LoL",

I can happily keep my load a little less, but I'm more concerned the 16GB will be out of date quick. I usually keep it at home, and I don't mind how heavy it is. I plan to buy a cooling pad if I get the higher up one.\n\nI'm not sure why the price difference is so large. Could you/anyone please help me understand the biggest differences function-wise that you see? One has a higher quality Intel processor, the other an older AMD, but is this why the price gap is big? I appreciate it. : ] \n\nEDIT: (Also, I know the $1k option has no iGPU, I'll keep it plugged in while using so I'm not worried about battery life. Just want to know if the $400 price hike is actually worth it. I currently have an old MSI Intel Core i7-8750H with a Nividia 1050 Ti graphics card and 32 GB RAM I got in school 2018. It has always done well, I've loved it, but i need something in between getting a desktop in a few years, so this may be temporary and that's why I'm leaning to get the cheaper option.) \n\n🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼",

I am not in your region and therefore do not know if it is on sale, etc etc.\n\nI suggest regular backups if you have an 8TB HDD.\nYou will not need a powerful machine to do simple file sorting. However, video editing, even putting your photos in an slideshow video doesn't require alot.

  "Ok my friend.\n\nSurface Pros are a nightmare to repair.\nI have heard the laptops are much easier.\nThe reason why this is significant is that in the case you break your laptop, and you take it into the repair shop, the poor guy who tries to help you because you needed it fixed by yesterday can actually fix it. You may not know, but parts are extremely hard to find, for a good price. \nExample, some MacBook pro models require you to buy a new screen when you want to purchase a new battery.\nBatteries should be replaced every two years, as per expert recommendation, as the capacity and health will decline over time. However, this screen battery combo is $600-$800USD, which is insane. And if you don't want to pay that, your only option is to buy aftermarket, and who knows what Chinese warehouse aftermarket is from. I've gotten good parts and bad parts from aftermarket. And then your computer repair guy takes the loss of its not a good part. Screen replacements can cost $100USD to $1000USD. No joke.\nHowever, I recommend at least 24GB of RAM for a laptop that you want to last 2+ years.\nSurface laptop is like buying a MacBook. It's a premium machine. You are paying extra for that premium that comes with the Surface brand name.

  "As of current, an NPU (of what makes an AI chips so special) is (to my understanding) a bit of a marketing thing. They do have real use, but it's not anything your GPU cannot do.

That's basically the biggest thing in its favor following with the i7-14th gen, of which is the best of the best designation with HX, which basically means it's really cool (it can overclock, for enthusiasts only)\nI cannot vouch for build quality, unfortunately. Omen is made by HP, so take that with it. Just take good care of it. Laptops are not indestructible, but it is infuriating that they don't make them better \n\nThis will handle his music tasks like a pro if he can keep it cool and keep it clean.",

  "Even if I did know a cheaper option, it probably would not be avaliable in your area.\n\nPeople hate on Intel. However, they are still the most popular brand out there. \nAssuming you are willing sacrifice performance for a little more battery life, getting a Core Ultra 7 or an Intel Core i7 should be ok.",
  "I did not click on the links.\n\nThe Ultra 7 (no 2).is going to have middle performance compared to no 4 highest of the bunch (excluding 1) And no 3's lowest performance.\n2,3,4 are great options, with the most powerful being 1,4,2,3. \n\nYou are going to love the OLED screens, especially when watching movies, 3,4\n\n16GB RAM on all of those is living on the edge. I would look and see if the RAM is soldered down, and if you can replace it later on. It's not an immediate issue. \n\n2,3,4 are all great computers with 1 being a little overkill.\nAs I said in my guide, the Intel Core Ultra will be more efficient (relatively)\nAnything else?",
  "You don't need an iGPU, you want a dGPU. Option 2 has a dGPU. An iGPU is an Integrated Graphics Processing Unit, which means the graphics lives inside of your CPU, it's a mini GPU that isn't sufficient for high end gaming. It's great because it's more efficient and good for basic tasks and light gaming. A dGPU is a Dedicated Graphics Processing Unit. It is it's own chip that is usually much more powerful than an iGPU. This is what you want for high end gaming or performance, it's not as efficient as having an iGPU, but much more powerful.",

  "Some people say that MacBook's don't need as much RAM as Windows, and I haven't seen any huge issues arise from this. 16GB RAM on Mac is just fine. MacOS is a different operating system from windows, it's built differently. What you gain with Mac is battery life, what you lose is performance and compatibility, however, for your use case it's just fine.\nSorry for not clarifying this, good luck m8.\n\nJust because your from different country doesn't mean I can't give you advice tailored to your situation. Know that I as an American respect you and your country.",

AI ready and AI chips are a bit of a marketing thing. If I had to sum it up, I would say the Ultra Core 9 would act more like an Intel Core i8.25, if that existed. Ultra 7, like an i6.25, and Ultra 5 like an i4.25.",
  "My man, I highly recommend against 8GB of RAM, unless you are comfortable with the performance hit, I strongly recommend against it. Times have changed and 8GB is simply not enough. Feel free to not take my recommendations, but do remember it will come at a cost. It's got a decent i5 12th Gen processor, and it's going to be powerful ish, but the fact that the i5 12th Gen you picked out is mobile, makes it more like a powerful i3 12th Gen. That's still fine with day to day browsing.",
  "Woah. Ok, I cannot recommend on the build quality of any specific computer. That would take hours of my day. Sorry m8.\n\nHowever, I can help with the H and U designation.\nA U processor has better battery life, but much less performance, relative to the chip. The H has more performance, and less battery life, relative to the chip. I'd say (this is a complete guess) a 30 min to 1 hour difference in battery life and 10-30 fram difference. Keep in mind this is a guess based on intuition! \n\nSeeing as how you wanted a laptop with an integrated CPU, I suggest getting a CPU. ;D any laptop with an i5 or Intel Core Ultra has a CPU!\nWhat you will want is to have an H processor with a graphics card like an RTX 3050 like you mentioned for gaming. Have a U processor for a laptop that you take around for school and stuff, if that is what you wanted.",
  "Was it the starting at machine?\n\nFor a Windows machine, 8GB is horrendous. For a Mac, you need about 25% less RAM. Id go with a 16GB model if possible.\nYou won't be able to do any gaming or high demand applications with any Mac, but you get great battery life and the Apple Ecosystem.",
  "It's ok to post here, I think it's cool I am reaching people from all over the world! I could not reach the link, if you look up how DNS servers work, you can learn why. \nThat will absolutely meet your needs, it will be just fine. Other than the 16GB of RAM, which I would prefer to be 24GB of RAM, it all looks good. However, if your needs are game emulation and FFXIV, then you will do just fine with that laptop.",
  "It's fine, I understood your English just fine. :)\nFor a good screen, an OLED screen is widely regarded as the most beautiful of screens. The darks are very dark, you'd just have to see it compared to a backlit display (LED, IPS, LCD)\nIntel Arc Graphics are by no means bad. Intel is making Arc as a direct competitor to NVIDIA and AMD. They have done a really great job even I applaud them. That card will only get better, it is good enough now to suit your needs. If that sounds good to you, I'd go with the Asus Zenbook 14 with the Arc Graphics and Intel Core Ultra 7.\nZenbook pro 14 is a big no. I have no clue why they would build such a beast with an i9 processor and 16GB of RAM, overkill processor, inadequate RAM.\n60Hz refers to the amount of times your display will refresh, like the Frames Per Second in movies or Games. You don't need higher unless you are high end gamer, although these displays with high refresh rates tend to have smoother look and feel, incrementally. You don't need it, is what I am trying to say. 60Hz is just fine.\nFor CAD, the CPU does 60% of the work. Intel Core Ultra 7 will handle it fine.",
  "1, no, it has 8GB RAM. 2 for the same, 3 same reason, but 16GB of RAM, and 4 is also 16GB of RAM. Don't expect any of these to last 4 years simply on the Basis of too little RAM. Aim for 24GB or more.\nThe other specs look good, RAM is the one issue.\nIn other words you could have the exact same machine work, I would recommend the exact same machine if they met the 24GB RAM recommendation.",
  "It's not that much of a difference, thinking relative to your needs now. It's a significant performance difference, but I cannot find a good reason to justify the $40. Acer laptop also seems to be the better deal because of the 1TB SSD and the better battery. However, for web browsing, the size SSD is not a major problem. If you want a laptop that will last anywhere from a little more to maybe extend the life by a year, go for it. It's up to you. \nThe RAM will likely be the biggest determining factor in the lifetime of the laptop. Make sure to consider of the RAM is soldered on either before making a final decision, as of it is soldered, it basically eliminates life support for your laptop.",
  "Phantom Forces is the way.\nJava for Kings. (Or Queens now I got to figure out a better term for it)\n\nRoblox FPS caps out at 60, as far as I know. I very easily get 60 FPS on a 10th Gen Intel i5 CPU and a RTX 3050. Vanilla Minecraft Java I get basically everything along with OBS recording in the background. You will be just fine specwise my dude.",
  "This will be just fine to game on Roblox. Exceptional. Idk why people say OLED bad this and OLED bad that. Today, an OLED screen is one of the most beautiful screens you can get, beautiful coming from experts and not me. The darks are true dark so the contrast is great. 11.5 hours of battery is a lie, I will add that to my list. realistically about 4-6 hours. It should be fine, just make sure he carries a charger, and 6 hours isn't even bad. Batteries just don't last that long. They test that figure with \"optimal\" conditions, which is usually turning brightness all the way down, turning on power saving and playing a 720p mp3 video. \nIntel Arc Graphics are higher end than Iris, from what I gain. \nIntegrated Arc is just the graphics included in your CPU, CPU:s usually have a mini GPU for display when you don't have a dGPU.",

  "I think you should upgrade the RAM for it if you would like to keep it for more than 2 years. It will be great for video editing and Gaming as it has an RTX 4060 inside of it. I can not tell you whether something is a good deal. Prices can vary by region and simple whim, and it is hard to keep track of all that. I would suggest comparing it to similar spec'd items to consider whether it is a good deal.",
  "First thing, 16GB RAM is not overkill, it is too little when the laptop is expected to last two years. you should have at least 24GB of RAM to future proof it. This is especially important considering the amount of screens.\n\nYou need to make sure your computer will support that amount of screens, not just the processor. Some computers are limited to two monitors or three, make sure to check.\n\nFor day trading, I recommend having a laptop with an Ethernet port attached. This model does not seem to have one, but you can buy an Ethernet to USB adapter. Ethernet eliminates Wi-Fi instability. I made a segment in my guide.\n\nI would not be surprised if they made a little change to the price like that, just to get you to buy it. I cannot recommend a fair price, as it varies by region and whim.",

Leaving an SSD unpowered for more than 5 years and you should expect to see data loss. \n\nLenovo laptops are Hit or Miss, most laptops are, however, their high end servers seem to not be.\n\nI admit that I have seen widely varying lithium ion battery life, but experts I trust who specialize in batteries recommend 2 years as general advice.\n\nI know that CPU's have things like memory cache, which affect performance of CPU, I am strong in my position that CPU GHz is not direct performance.

Problem is that they have had some compatibility issues since they are basically a super phone processor in a laptop.

I would suggest specifically looking if your program is supported if you are looking into buying. Surface Laptop 7 seems to be widespread deal for snapdragon processors. \n\nAnother recommendation if you want to forgo the battery life in favor of higher performance and the top tier of compatibility, try a core ultra Processor. At least Core Ultra 5 for your use.",

  "The RAM is only 16GB, don't expect it to last more than 2 years until you start to experience slowdowns.\n\nBecause it is a gaming laptop, it is more likely to have upgradable RAM. This is something you can do at home with a screwdriver and a bit of knowhow. You can buy 32GB worth of RAM for around $60, and you can do so in a year. I would check to make sure your laptop's RAM can be upgraded.",

  "Hi, I liked your write-up and some good info btw.  As for online info, a lot of variation depending on usage and experiences is what you find.  A lot of people repeat what they read but have no actual experience.  I do sometimes but usually only after I verify with sources I trust.  My laptop is a Dell Latitude with i7, 12Gb, SSD and is too slow for gaming and too small a display for CAD so I use mostly for going online, office apps and 3D print slicer apps.  I can't afford to game on a laptop.  I have a home built desktop, i7 CPU but more ram and GTX video I use for CAD and some Steam games.  I used to use only AMD because it was my preference, maybe due to pricing, but I do CAD probably more than gaming so I look for high ghz single core performance and that's usually intel.  \n\nIMO for gaming you can't beat a console.  Xbox or Playstation - at $500 its a steal compared with building a gaming PC and keeping it updated every couple of years so you can keep playing the current titles.  Let's see, should I spend $350 on a new CPU, $200 on a new board, $500 on a new video card and $70 on some more RAM and make due with my SSD for now or maybe get a Series X 1TB no-disc version for $399 plus $60 a year?  I actually prefer the console gaming experience but I have to keep my PC upgraded for CAD so I end up doing both every few years.",

I've been using refurbished laptops that break after a year for the last few years and I'm done with that mess because it's a huge headache when they fail.  I'm considering taking the risk on a Nimo cyber monday deal (that's the brand that the other commenter linked above).  The 16 ram and 1tb is on sale for $299 and the same specs but 32 ram is on sale for $379.  In your opinion, is it worth spending the extra $80 on the extra 16 of ram?  Sorry if I'm using the wrong lingo, hopefully you get the gist.\n\nSecond question that is a bit off topic, but you seem to REALLY know your stuff and I'm so impressed.  What do you recommend for data hoarders to use to back up their data?  My refurbished pc began to fail last week at the worst possible time and I realized I hadn't backed anything up in about two months.   Do you recommend any particular program?  I've just been copying and pasting my data onto an external but can't find a system to keep track of what I've backed up.  I suck at tech stuff but do have a TON of data that I must keep secure.

  "I've looked at both laptops. The first laptop with an AMD processor is a decent processor, but the one with the core ultra 7 may be better, although I am not sure. Which model of Ultra 7 is it? 64GB of RAM will not be used much, but you won't notice any slowdowns related to RAM for sure. The graphics card of the second one will help with graphics processing, but you need CPU for audio processing. \nFor double the price, it isn't double the performance.\nHP has been notorious for build quality issues. People seem to love Lenovo ThinkPads (specifically the T and P series) but personally I cannot vouch for them. \nLess ports is a thing that everyone is doing. it's cheaper and it looks nicer, although it limits usability. do note that a good laptop dock can cost $400. I would go for a better processor, at least a processor with an H at the end of it. Like an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H or Intel Core i7-13500H. Those would be perfect for flawless dj work, and it should be over the minimum enough to avoid slowdowns. \nI wouldn't go for 16GB anything, as I described above.",

Intel made this to compete with NVIDIA, and they have worked a few years on it. They have a full size GPU out and it did very well apart from compatibility issues that are now largely resolved. They are not top line yet, but Intel is a monster of a company with a place in the market, it will catch up. I can imagine people saying instead of two big GPU makers there are three.

No good!\nYes, it is totally worth the extra $80, although really it should be no more than $40, but don't expect to find a fair upcharge. \nIf you hate your laptops breaking constantly, try getting a business class laptop, I also recommend spending more to spend less on the future. I know it hurts. I really do.\nFor data hoarders, windows has a built in backup thing called backup and restore windows 7, you can still find it in windows 11 or 10. I use it every single month, works great. I also use AOMEI to do a second set of backups (same data different medium) have not had to ever use those backups so I don't know how well aomei works but backup and restore, well,.you can restore from right there. There is a recommended method for data backup, but I am not going to type that out. I recommend getting two external HDD if whatever size, maybe 2TB or 1TB (TB is TeraByte, 1,000GB or 1,024GB (windows makes this weird, it's why your drives may seem smaller than advertised, not going to explain it)) those two HDD should have the exact same stuff on them, if one fails which HDD's do, mechanical spinning disks, you will have time to buy and receive a new one and not lose any data. I personally backup to two separate HDD, one is bigger so one has more data, but all the same data, and then I also have various external drives that I use to keep single use data, for archival purposes. Cannot lose all those books.  HDD failure is a fact of life but if you buy a decent HDD (I buy Seagate ones) then treat it like it can happen but not likely to. Be aware but not afraid.\nI have a 500GB Samsung T7 which I love because it's aluminum chassis and I think cost me a out $30USD, I could be wrong. SSD is more expensive per GB of data but it will take a VERY long time to wear away especially if you write around a TB a month. Also when SSD fail unless it's on fire, you can still get data off of it you just can't put it on. No writing, only reading. Makes it basically fail proof. Never store data for more than 5 years, it can fade away. Make sure plug it in leave it there every year or so, something like that. \n\nMy eyes burning so no fixing red lines\n\nNo problem, I love helping you guys out.\nI want to acknowledge all the guys in my field who make a living off of their passion. it's not easy. People are not accommodating and are frankly rude and disrespectful. I hate seeing computer shop owners so jaded, because it tells of the abuse they have suffered. It's getting harder to repair, it's getting harder to find parts, and companies are going out of their way to make an extra buck just so you throw your device away after a year or two. I even found it a bit exasperating having 32 notifications once just trying to eat my dinner (wasn't that much  of a dinner, I burned my eggs). It can be frustrating. On top of that some Redditers got angry over the fact that I made a guide in the first place. Comments of appreciation like yours are so helpful, and make me want to do this and better next year.

There is 1 nice curve to counter that but it doesn't fully let the exhaust open, some air blows onto the screen due to this.\nIt is also getting quite hot during the update process, as I saw on the zenbook reviews (way more reviews on that one then the cheaper Vivobook S16 with this specific cpu).\n\nI have an asus motherboard in my desktop and their thermal pads are crap, so at some point I will probably repoace the pads and paste with upsiren putty and ptm 7950, I hope this will help get less hot, we'll see.",

  "Totally understandable. There's a particular store here in the UK where I can get 10% off all laptops and then an additional 6%.

So glad you seem to love it, sorry the cooling has issues, but it will be hot for first few hours or days after purchasing as windows settles in.\n\nFan curve can be hard to change, I use speedfan, if that doesn't work, then I have to look into a model specific work around. Doesn't mess with anything other than fan speed, so pretty safe id say. I always have my fans at highest. I must have cooling and not cooking.",

  "Ideapad Gaming 3 vs Legion 5 (both RTX 3060M, AMD Ryzen 7 5800H) for basic AI/ML applications, in addition to watching movies/ browsing? So I currently have an Ideapad 700-15isk released in 2015-16. Its an excellent laptop which now has a 15 minute battery, and a GTX 950M that was awfully slow even for basic ML tasks (even prediction not just training). According to [this website](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-950M-vs-Nvidia-RTX-3060/m27713vs4105), the RTX 3060 is way better. Yeah, for truly big tasks I'd use some cloud units but for basic operations like training for 1-2 epochs to check for errors, I'd appreciate some local computing power- I've stopped ML coding lately due to the hassle of starting Colab sessions every time I wanna code.  \n\nAs of now I'm not buying for gaming purposes, since I already have an Xbox Series X that most gaming laptops don't come close to. At most I may occasionally use it for PC-optimized/exclusive games like CS:GO, Football Manager, AOE and some torrented old games. But maybe somewhere down the line, I may move to a different city or I may decide to do higher studies, it may then come in handy for gaming. \n\nOf course, the laptop should be good for regular stuff like handling a browser with 30+ open tabs and 20+ add-ons/extensions without slowdowns. Battery and portability not a concern. Display not a concern since I already have a nice monitor. Durability/build quality a big concern since I can be quite clumsy sometimes, should be able to handle the occasional drop/weight on top as well as water spills with minimal/inexpensive repairs and maintenance. For reference, my existing Ideapad handled my clumsiness with grace, as did my Thinkpad E490. Mostly, I would use it for personal stuff like browsing, writing utility scripts, etc. with the capability of AI/ML and gaming which I don't do often. I know I'm looking at buying a Ferrari, but I hope these laptops are not as impractical for day-to-day use as a Ferrari. I don't mind the slight 200-300$ premium that I am paying for the flexibility. \n\nThe Legion costs only about 100$ more in my country compared to the IdeaPad. And these 2 are the only laptops that showed up when I was looking for GPUs comparable to a GTX 1080Ti that I used on somebody else's PC a few months ago, and costing under 1200$ and having 16 GB RAM and i7/ryzen 7 processor. And the RTX 3060 seemed to benchmark similarly to it, as shown in the website linked earlier.\n\n**TL:DR- I want a jack of all trades, master of none, where AI/ML is counted as a trade. I am fine with other recommendations apart from the mentioned laptops in the title**",
  "Legion 5 has third-party fan control software available.  This is a big deal.",
  "From what I saw online.\n\nThe Legion is a better machine in general, The website you used isn't the best for comparing it has some bias, and I think you chose a desktop 3060 not the laptop model.\n\nThe ThinkPad always had a good reputation for durability and it's hard to match.\n\nI would recommend you to watch Legion 5 reviews on youtube I think it's a very good all-around laptop, but don't take my word for it.",
  "Ok, apart from that would you recommend it for non gaming purposes as well, i.e. 90%+ of the time as explained in the post?",
  "Fan control is most important for the non-gaming purposes.  It means that you can keep the fans at very slow speeds or even idle during web browsing sessions.  Then you can limit the fans at 2200 RPM until 85 degrees C, where they won't be annoyingly loud.  After 85, they really need to cool the computer, let them kick in at full speed.\n\nMy legion 5 seems to have ended up with a bad touchpad though.  😢",
  "Ok nice to know. But what if I'm an idiot who forgets to turn the fan back on. Won't that overheat the system and cause damage and if so is there a safeguard against that?\n\nAnd also, does the third party software void the warranty? I don't like to download modded or cracked software that could have malware a few days after buying the laptop.",
  "It's specified as a fan curve.  You say what speed you want for a particular temperature.  This makes sure it won't overheat, because once the temperature is high, you have your higher speed setting automatically kick in.\n\nI have the fans basically stopped when under 50, then at 2200RPM before it reaches a high enough temperature.\n\nDoes it void the warranty?  I don't think it does.",

  "G14 R9 7 series - RTX4060 or R9 6 series - 6800s So I found an ongoing deal on BB  for a G14 R9 7490 with a rtx4060 for $1400 and another G14 R9 6900 with a and 6800s for $1200. Is the $200 extra worth the difference? Or should I look else where. \nTypical use will be for graphic work and light gaming, mostly looking for a 14\" to throw in a small bag so portability. I was eyeing the Asus ZenBook pro 14\" but got lots of mix reviews. I'm not worried about price, I can save up to the $2100 but thought the g14 seemed like a good deal.",
  "What kind of mixed reviews have you heard about the Zenbook Pro 14? I've been considering getting it since it seems nearly perfect, but if the negatives were enough to turn you away from it I'm curious to know what they were",
  "Well I'm sure you know all the positive reviews, the negatives that I have found that it has poor battery performance compared to others, getting hot or warm when on light usage. Limited GPU and CPU performance due to max power which is a total of both at 125w. Bad screen glare due to glossy screen, and some have found that the thermal paste usage is garbage and holding it back.\nIf your someone that can play around with the settings and hardware you might be able to get around some of these and depending on what your using it for, you may look else where.\nI initially had it in sight for the portability and power but can have portability if battery will only last me 1 to 2 hours.\nThough I have tried either as I'm a person in a gulf country and can't benefit from buying and returning it like the US.",
  "I've never heard of any issues with heat and especially not with performance , and I'm wondering if the thermal paste is just a lemon rather than a widespread QC issue. I am a bit concerned about the battery though, since I've mostly heard people say it's around 6-8 hours",
  "Not sure about thermal paste but I have read a few people already were replacing it and got better temperatures.",

  "Given they have different shipping dates you might find the customisation options are different.\n\nDevices with basically open options usually have long delivery times and cost more but allow to pick just about any available option.\n\nDevices with some of the specs locked and only basic things like storage changeable are usually cheaper.",

  "Yep. If the laptop on the left doesn't have it, it's a good enough reason to get it. One less thing to uninstall.",
  "why? I would wipe a new device and clean install it",
  "What I was wondering lol cause with the CPU it says UP to 5.00 GHz meaning he might get a slightly cheaper CPU running 2.00 GHz and it says to build it. Im thinking these are there demo screens for basic cost",

  "We'd need links to dig into the specs we can't see. Beyond that, sometimes situations like this are the difference between a configurable vs. fixed-spec system (I think HP is notorious for this.) Otherwise, occasionally you can configure systems and get weird results that you wouldn't expect based on the raw specs alone, based on how the components are calculated internally (i.e. you can get one system cheaper by configuring it to have the same specs as another one.)\n\nIn any case, go for the one on the left obviously!",
  "The 6 week delay could be part of it.  Apart from the GPU and copilot differences cheaper one could be from the remaining stock in hand from a batch imported a month or two ago at a different exchange rate or different manufacturer costs being sold out at its original price.\n\nPerhaps the manufacturers pricing has gone up slightly and the price of the one available in 6 weeks is the new pricing - slightly higher price for slightly worse specs.",
  "usually the configure option has more options like RAM, Storage and CPU etc. \n \nAlso got more specs options on the hyper link.",
  "Check whether the power button is right next to the delete key in either model. Avoiding that is worth more than £100",
  "most likely a matter of them getting a deal on the 5060 and the system updating prices automatically, so no one internally has noticed this hick-up. Deal could be based on larger order size",
  "I remove all unnecessary programs after reinstalling Windows, this pilot runs in the background and eats up the processor and RAM.",

  "And you wanna know something cool?  \nMy Desktop with a Ryzen 5 33600X from 6 YEARS AGO, is only 30% slower in \"full performance mode\" than this \"new\" processor.  \n  \nThere's the obvious efficiency of the new chip, supports DDR 5 which nowadays makes almost no difference, because GPUS have their own memory for games and high intensity processing.   \nAnd the architecture between both generations matters a lot in how efficient they are (Ryzen 5 3600X is 7nn and the AMD AI is 4nn)  \n  \nBUT  \nThe 3600X has \"double\" single core base clock speed, (3.8GHZ base clock per core vs 2.0Ghz).  \nIt has higher L1 and L3 Cache.\n\nWe often think new is better... Until it's not.  \nYes, it has some new good things,  but many times you lose other great features.   \nAlso, the integrated graphics is probably at the level of a RTX 1060, and according to some tests, seems to bottleneck the processor speed.",
  "If I was going to buy one, I would pick the cheaper one, and probably buy a bigger SSD + add RAM if possible.  16GBs of RAM is nothing nowadays!  \nAnd if you play a lot of games 1TB fills up pretty quickly.\n\nDon't think about expanding with external drives, USB is a lot slower than m.2 SSDs",
  "They both have copilot+PC, as I've clearly stated 😂",
  "Definitely has it, that copilot button is brighter than a lighthouse",
  "The RAM storage and CPU exactly the same that hyperlink  only reveals one extra spec which again is exactly the same",
  "Na, power is in the middle of laptop, above keyboard",
  "well deserved",
  "They're not 1300, they'll be 20% cheaper. \n\nFind me an 8gb that actually runs 100w for cheaper and I'll buy it 😂",
  "I'm no serious gamer, I've gone for 32gb and 1tb SSD I doubt I'll need more as AAA games get played on my PS5 anyway.",
  "cant be man, only one got the COP+PC branding, being able to run and built-in is something different. I mean if you \"think\" that the first one also supports or got COP+PC then i think that where you are wrong. They aint gonna add +100$ just for that shit ROFL",
  "is it because it has a copilot key 😂 or cheaper because of logistics (ready to be shipped). But yeah manufacturers that do this are just confusing people, especially new buyers.",
  "Gonna be honest, the laptop market right now is absolutely shite. Simply wanting to get more storage than what you’re currently looking at will probably increase the price by £100 and that doesn’t guarantee the niceties of expandable ram.\n\nIve genuinely looked at every major manufacturer’s website and Curry’s but the only laptops i’d consider to last you 7 years start at £1,800.\n\nI would recommend going second hand through eBay, it’s very consumer oriented in terms of buyer protections and you’ll get computers that are 3 years ahead in terms of compute power.

I'll post my latest discoveries on my unit below.\n\n\nI just tweaked my Y530 base model this month. My gaming temperatures went from 90deg (PROCHOT max temp up to 94deg to 99deg) down to 50-60 degrees below. Browsing temperature is around 30-50 degrees. CPU and GPU runs automatically due to my BIOS software installed. Battery life (unplugged) before was only an hr and a half but now with my tweaked settings accompanied with low brightness and low power mode is around 3 to 4 hours now just as what Lenovo advertised last 2017-2018.\n\n\nI undervolted and disabled turbo boost using ThrottleStop and XTU. Then I created a power saver option in my Control Panel for battery usage as well as disabling the windows search. I also disabled the background apps in the settings of Windows 10. I sacrificed the turbo boost and high performance mode for my laptop's longetivity. I probably won't need to use a laptop stand to elevate my unit during gaming. Still works well in games tho even if the FPS is reduced to half from any games with Ultra/Max settings.\n\n\n**SPECS**\nY530 i5-8300h, GTX 1050ti 4GB, 24GB Ram, 250 SSD, 1 TB HDD, 250 nits, 60Hz display and 200 charge cycles since December 2019 (Laptop is 8 months old equipped with a silicon keyboard cover with a cheap laptop stand).\n\n\nMost of my apps and software are related to Games (Valorant, LoL, Dota2, Heroes of Newerth, Crossfire, BF5, etc.) and Architecture (2d & 3d modeling, layouting, video editing, and rendering) such as Adobe, Autodesk, Sketchup, Lumion, etc. Hoping to see some feedbacks and conversations within the comment section coming from this Reddit family.

  "I recall Dave2D comparing both Acer Nitro 5 and 7 on Youtube. While the Nitro 7 is the higher end model of the two with an aluminum cover rather than all plastic, he preferred the Nitro 5 because it had better internal cooling design.\n\nJust to be clear... it's aluminum, not aluminium you muppet.  :)\n\nIntel 8th and 9th gen Core CPUs run hot so undervolting is highly recommended. The 9th CPUs are basically higher clocked 8th gen CPUs for all intents and purposes. That means the undervolting potential is lower than with 8th gen CPUs; 8th gen CPUs can typically remain stable with a -125mv undervolt, but it seems 9th gen CPUs are only capable of dealing with a -75mv to -100mv undervolt before becoming unstable. Dropping down to a 9th gen Core i5 CPU can potentially mean better thermals because it has 4 cores rather than 6 core in a Core i7 CPU. Do a Google / Youtube search for a program called ThrottleStop which allows you to undervolt the CPU or limit how much the power the CPU will use so that it operates at lower temps. You can also limit the clockspeed among other things.\n\nI am not very familiar with Ryzen APUs. I am not aware of any program that will allow you to undervolt or otherwise limit the clockspeed of mobile Ryzen APUs. AMD released an overclocking / underclocking utility called Ryzen Master, but it only works with desktop Ryzen APUs. That means if mobile Ryzen APUs suffer from overheating, then your choices are limited to the following:\n\n1. Replace the thermal paste with something like Thermal Grizzly Kyronaut\n2. Go into the power options and set maximum processor state below 100%. Setting it to 99% disables Turbo Boost in Intel CPUs which means an i7-9750h will be limited to 2.6GHz. I assume for Ryzen APUs it will disable Turbo Core.\n\nAccording to the following article, the Ryzen 7 3750H provides negligible performance gains over the Ryzen 5 3550H.\n\n[https://www.notebookcheck.net/Not-worth-it-AMD-Ryzen-7-3750H-is-only-4-to-8-percent-faster-than-the-Ryzen-5-3550H.426841.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Not-worth-it-AMD-Ryzen-7-3750H-is-only-4-to-8-percent-faster-than-the-Ryzen-5-3550H.426841.0.html)",

  "Unless you need a touchscreen, I would go with the 1st.  32gb over 16gb every time.",
  "I would honestly avoid the Acer, at the low end their stuff is REALLY cheap. They make good high end stuff but their quality falls off a cliff as it goes down. \n\nThe Asus only has 16gb of ram to the acers 32gb. Lunar lake cpus have the ram attached to the CPU, so the ram amount is dictated by whether it's a 2x6v (16gb) or 2x8v(32gb). Since these laptops do not have separate gpus, the integrated graphics will use system memory. So if you plan on using anything graphically intensive, or just want/need 32gb, the 2x8v is a must. Ram is not upgradable due to it being attached to the CPU. \n\nYou also need to understand the pros and cons of IPS vs OLED and that's something you need to read up on independently because I'm not qualified enough to explain it. But also go to a store and actually look at both types of displays, even if they're on other models, and see which is right for you.\n\nIf it had to be between these two I'd say the Asus unless you need the 32gb of ram, then the Acer is the only option.

You can feel the 32gb even in light multitasking over the 16gb, just slightly snappier, but 16 will work for many people. For basic usage, I'd get the Asus machine. Better build quality and keyboard with the OLED screen.",
  "I’ll have to disagree with your statement lol",
  "Well the Asus is a 2 in 1, so it will have the pros and cons of a 2 in 1 hinge. Pros, it flips to tablet mode. Cons, it's a very bulky hinge.\n\nAlso the bottom chassis on the Asus is extremely thin, and they usually trade that off on 2 in 1s (all brands) to minimize bulk on the back when in tablet mode. So you'll get louder fan noise and more keyboard flex. One thing the Lenovo I've seen multiple times was how great the keyboard was to type on.\n\nThe Lenovo's battery life is simply the best battery life you can get in a laptop rn. Granted we're getting into times that don't matter, it's been regularly tested to have over 24 hours of video playback. I haven't seen a review on the flip, but on the non flip, it was closer to 21 hours under the same conditions. Both are absurd, but there's definitely less efficiency in the Asus laptops. \n\nThe Lenovo has a second thunderbolt port, the Asus only has 1 and then the second USBc is only 3.2 granted this is a minor thing and I doubt will matter to most people\n\nBut at this price point, 200 dollars is a hard pill to swallow. I'd ballpark at least 150 of that 200 the extra ram, which should also speak volumes to the (lack of) quality of the Acer. The lunar lake laptops use incredibly fast low power ram, which is why for being such small, low power cpus, they are able to keep up within reason. I'd bet the other 50 could be justified on the other thunderbolt port and overall build quality. \n\nImo, the 32gb is a must considering it's non replaceable. My desktop has been for about 8 years. And while heavy workloads have regularly gone above 16gb, regular task used to not. But slowly even that's been creeping up, and I remember when about 8 years ago the recommendation was 4 gigs on a budget, 8 was normal and 16 for enthusiast, 32 was only if you needed it for professional work. Well I went with 32 anyways and then it was overkill but now it's not. 4 is unusable, 8 is bare minimum to boot, 16 is value and 32 seems optimal if you plan on keeping the device for any length of time. Like I said, the igpu will use this for video memory as well, so if your application needs 4gb of vram, say a light game, suddenly your system now only has 12gb of vram vs 28gb. So I would look at the applications you use currently, just say middle of a work day or what not and see what your system is using. If there's a healthy margin then maybe not spend the extra money for the extra ram. If it's getting close now, think of whatll happen in the next 2 years or so.",

  "They cost roughly the same. Obviously, the Dell is going to be expensive because it has more RAM and Storage. And how is it weaker to boot? You can't expect every single device to boot up fast. If I were you, I wouldn't worry about slightly slower boot-up times.",
  "If its you budget yea either victus or Lenovo LOQ. I feel like the Acer and Asus laptops around 800 or less are kinda of a reach.",
  "Yes, the Victus is the more capable option.",
  "I too have a laptop with both DGPU and iGPU, even on iGPU mine works only for 30 minutes. My intel CPU is power hungry .",
  "ah alright, ill just play t safe and get a good gaming laptop with decent battery (does that even exist???)",
  "How much it cost, does it comes around 600$ ?",
  "The A500 ? Gets beaten by integrated graphics on ryzens 7 after 7th gen.",
  "I don’t think op will find one he can afford let alone one at the same price of the Victus (650$) with a gpu better than a gtx 1650",
  "The Core 7 150u in the Dell is approximately 20% slower than the Ryzen 7-7445HS in the HP: [Link](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/6767vs5944/AMD-Ryzen-7-7445HS-w-Radeon-740M-Graphics-vs-Intel-7-150U)\n\nRAM and storage can be upgraded.\n\nUnless OP is doing just plain old programming, any other form of engineering is going to benefit from both the faster Ryzen chip AND the dedicated GPU.\n\nSo yes, the Dell is more expensive while being weaker and less useful for engineering tasks.",
  "English colloquialism:  \"to boot\" means \"in addition\". \" Weaker to boot\" = \"additionally, it's a worse computer\" not \"it takes longer to start up.\"",
  "Im the modern day you can indeed expect every device to boot up fast. Fast SSDs are cheap.",
  "Kind of, gaming laptops with the new AMD cpus kinda have a better battery life compared to intel, just make sure the cpu in your gaming laptop has a igpu, that way in class you can switch to igpu if need and switch to gpu when needed. If your cpu doesnt have a igpu it will use the gpu all the time and consume more battery.   \nToo sum up, gaming laptops with AMD cpus that have igpu, my top picks are ROG Zephyrus and Strix and lenovo legion(note that the zephyrus tgp are locked at 110W while the strix and lenovo normally at 140w or more.",
  "Not unless you're going for a used/refurbished one. The majority of ThinkPad P-Series laptops start at around $900 and go up from there.",
  "Yeah, but he's doing engineering so I don't think a Gaming laptop is necessary for engineering.",
  "Thank you.",
  "yea imma skip the zephyrus cuz it just doesnt feed any power to the cpu, my main games are cpu heavy. under game loads, the cpu barely gets 20w of power, which explains the 180w powerbrick. really jsut deciding between what legion or strix variant to get, hopefully i can find one wiht a 5070ti (a man can dream), and 32 gigs of storage lol",
  "Literally EVERY FORM OF ENGINEERING THAT ISN'T SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AT IT'S MOST BASIC USES SOME FORM OF GPU ACCELERATION.\n\nAre you legitimately illiterate or just being obtuse for the sake of it?",
  "If they need a dGPU, I can assure you that a $650 budget would not \\*\\*begin\\*\\* to touch a business class / workstation class computer with a dGPU.  Gaming laptops are sub-optimal for lots of stuff but it makes some sense here as an affordable way to get a decent laptop with a GPU for a good price.  Take advantage of HP closing out the Victus division.",
  "Who knows, but good luck!",
  "BROTHER NOBODY IS GOING TO BE CARRYING A THICK, BULKY RGB LIT LAPTOP WITH A CHARGER EVERYWHERE JUST BECAUSE THE CPU IS A LITTLE FASTER.\n\nAre you being serious right now?",
  "20% is not \"a little faster\" that's a whole generational leap.\n\nAnd yes, many people do carry larger, beefier machines for engineering use. Endicott College, Wentworth, Bentley University all provide mobile workstations to their engineering students. A mobile workstation is effectively a better built gaming laptop without all the RGB crap.\n\nWhy do they have the students use those machines? ***Because those machines are designed specifically for engineering work and have the hardware chops to handle it.***"
