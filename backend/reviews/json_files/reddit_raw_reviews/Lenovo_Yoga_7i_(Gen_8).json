  "Lenovo Yoga 7i Gen10, 14-inch laptop (2025) review **UK-based Laptop Review**\n\n**1. Title:**  \nLenovo Yoga 7i Gen 10 (2025) Review: power and portability\n\n**2. Introduction:**\n\nThis is a review for the 2025 yoga 7i gen 10 model from Lenovo with intel core ultra 7 258v and 14 inch screen. I bought the configuration from the UK Lenovo website with 32GB RAM, 1TB SDD, 2.8k OLED 120Hz screen, Luna Grey colour and optioned the fingerprint scanner for an additional £10, paying £1090 in total (including the 10% VIP discount for healthcare workers). This is a premium grade 2-in-1 consumer laptop with a solid build, great for anyone who needs a portable and powerful device.\n\nI haven’t seen many user reviews for this particular generation of laptop so thought it would be useful for anyone considering it.\n\n**3. Design and Build Quality:**\n\nThe chassis all metal, which gives it a very solid feel. The build quality is great, there’s very little flex in the case or the keyboard. The body does not pick up fingerprints. At 1.4kg, it’s not the lightest laptop but it’s still very portable. It fits my 13 inch laptop sleeve. I don’t have much use for the tablet mode as I find it too cumbersome when compared with holding an actual tablet. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and the trackpad is smooth and accurate. I appreciate the double height enter key. Coming from the LG gram 16, this is a much better typing and trackpad experience.\n\nPort selection is good. There are 2 USB-C ports, one on either side, with one USB-A, one full-sized HDMI, a microSD card slot and a headphone jack. The power key is on the right side which I’ve mis-pressed a couple of times so I’ve disabled it in the settings.\n\nThe display is a 14-inch glossy OLED touchscreen with 2.8K resolution (2880 x 1800), 500 nits brightness (1100 nits HDR Peak). I find the screen bright and vibrant. Watching video in a dimmed room is fantastic with zero light bleed. Reflections and fingerprints can be an issue, especially when viewing dark things on the screen and there is bright ambient. However it is still useable under these conditions.\n\nThe hinges are solid, with little screen wobble when typing but it does require two hands to open the lid. The look and feel of the laptop is very nice with smooth rounded outer edges.\n\n**4. Performance and heat:**\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 258v is perfectly capable of handling my usual tasks of multiple Chrome/ Firefox tabs, connecting to my remote desktop for work and steaming video content.  I have tried some gaming and the experience with casual  games has been very good. Fortnite runs at 120FPS. Cities Skylines runs great. I’ve tried playing Watchdogs and although it could play it, the framerates were only around 40fps and the processor got quite hot with the fans getting noisy.\n\nThe keyboard and palm rest areas are always cool. The area under the screen gets warm under load but the hot air is blown out through the vents on the back, away from the user which is a good design.\n\n**5. Audio and Webcam:**\n\nThe speakers are fine, they are up firing from the sides of the keyboard and they are rated for Dolby Atmos. I can clearly hear the 3D effects when watching YouTube or Netflix. There isn't much bass but it is acceptable for a thin and light laptop.\n\nThe 5M IR camera is decent for video conferencing. There is a privacy shutter switch just above the camera. Windows Hello usually takes just a few seconds to log me in. I have found the fingerprint scanner works faster, especially when the lighting conditions are not ideal for Windows Hello.\n\n**6. Battery Life:**\n\nThe 70WHr battery lasts all day for me when web browsing/ streaming videos. I use a 100W Ugreen 4-port USB C charger to charge all my devices and the laptop fully charges within a couple of hours.  \n\n**7. Software and User Experience:**\n\nThe OS is Windows 11 Home 64 and comes with some minor bloatware including McAffee Antivirus, Lenovo support/ vantage/ AI shenanigans. The Lenovo Vantage software has some useful features including dimming various parts of the screen to save battery – I only use the taskbar dimming though as I find the background dimming too distracting. It also enables you to switch the laptop on just by lifting the lid, which means the much maligned side power switch is hardly ever used. There have been reports of this power button breaking easily on other models and thus bricking the device.\n\n**8. Price and Value:**\n\nThe base model costs £1000 (£900 for students or those that qualify for VIP member) and comes with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and a14inch WUXGA OLED screen (1920x1200, 400nits, 60Hz). I was happy to pay the \\~£200 premium for the better spec’d screen with double the RAM and SSD. Mine came with a 65W USB-C charger and a stylus pen which magnetically attaches to the lid.\n\n**9. Pros and Cons:**\n\n* **Pros:** Screen, performance, battery life, keyboard\n* **Cons:** Screen reflections, power key positioning.\n\n**10. Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a well-built laptop where the pros far out-weigh the cons. The OLED screen is fantastic and it has been a pleasure watching content in a darkened room. It is very easy to travel with, having all-day battery life and a thin and light form factor.\n\n**Final Rating:** 9/10",
  "Really nice post.\n\nIm looking into this as pretty much the only option as the price is really good compared to others.\n\nIm sceptical about the hinges, but you say they are fine. And also if the performance is okay, if i could spec it id go higher but there arent really any options. \n\nThe next thing is vivobook which goes about 50% more with worse screen",
  "How about the weight, does it feel heavy...do you think it's worth the penny and do you think it's a good investment until 2028 atleast?",
  "Im setting up my 16 inch model right now and the fans are running on low constantly and high pitch too, did yours do the same?",
  "Hey, I am curious how did you opt for the fingerprint scanner. I can't find it in the configurations. Thanks.",
  "Potentially stupid question...\n\nI'm comparing different Lenovo Yoga 7s on their website,  and nowhere does it say which generation is which... How do you guys know this information?\n\nThere's so many reviews out there 😵‍💫",
  "I'm thinking of getting this laptop but I'm wondering about the CPU performance for things like python and matlab number crunching(data/optimization/small simulations etc)\n\nJust curious what kind of work do you do on it and is the CPU fast enough for that? I'm still not sure whether the lesser multicore compared to a 200H arrow lake is a problem or if I'm overthinking about the 258V",
  "hello, here some questions:\n1. what version of hdmi port does it have?\n2. What components could you upgrade? ssd, battery, keyboard?",
  "Just a question: does the screen have a plastic border, or is it all glass? ",
  "[removed]",
  "Hi OP, I read a few other reddit posts regarding poor battery life on this particular screen option (2.8K) compared to alot of the youtube reviews (which seems to be based on the 1200 screen option). When you say all day do you mean \\~7 hours? Are you leaving your screen on 120Hz or reducing it to 60Hz.",
  "Hi, I’ve used a Lenovo Yoga 7 AMD from a few generations back with the Ryzen 6800U for the past 3 years and have had no issues with the hinges for what it’s worth!",
  "Thanks. Only time will tell regarding the hinges but they look and feel sturdy to me and these double hinge designs should in theory spread the force out across the 4 contact points on each hinge, reducing the stress at any one point. I'll update if I have any problems with the hinges",
  "It doesn't feel heavy but it's not feather-light like the LG gram. The LG gram can be lifted from a corner with one hand easily whereas I'd struggle to do this with the Yoga 7i. The Yoga 7i   feels more substantial, more premium. However it is still easy to carry around in a back pack.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase so far - it does everything I need and I feel it is good value for what you get compared to an equivalent from HP or Apple. As long as I keep the battery in good condition and the hinges don't break, I'm sure it'll last a good 3-5 years. \n\nIf I didn't play PC games, I would have strongly considered a macbook air 13\".",
  "The 14 inch model doesn't have this problem at all. It's mostly silent. Your 16 inch model should have even better thermal handling given the extra space. The constant fans might be due to all the updates being installed, see how it goes",
  "It came up as an option for me when I selected luna grey as the colour",
  "https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-pro-series/lenovo-yoga-pro-7i-gen-10-aura-edition-14-inch-intel/len101y0058\n\nIt can be confusing. The UK lenovo website states which gen it is,  the i is for Intel, they usually have AMD in brackets for AMD models. X means snapdragon. I think the gen 10s are sometimes called Aura Edition too",
  "1. The HDMI port is a standard sized 1.4b\n\n2. The SSD can be upgraded via the M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe SSD slot but that's about it. The RAM is soldered on the model I got.",
  "There is a black border around the screen but the glass extends over it. The border houses the web cam",
  "I turned off the side power button and activated the open screen to switch on option which works really well. It means I never accidentally mis-press the power button and it should last a lot longer",
  " battery life has been fine for me, I've kept it at 120Hz and only charge up to 80%. Off power, I've been using it for 5 hours now, browsing/ streaming at 50% screen brightness and there's still 45% remaining, so that's just 35% battery use after 5 hours of light usage. I would expect at least 12 hours from a fully charged battery",
  "So pc games work on this one? How is the performance, which games did you try out and does it heat up?",
  "Do you still see that option? Cause I don't see it when I want to configure it",
  "Interesting... Yea the Canadian site doesn't mention generation. We have all those versions though.",
  "yea the cpu and size are all included in the full model name, but aura edition stands for the optimized intel partnerships versions that have slightly better battery life and perfs",
  "Is it possible to replace the keyboard?",
  "Awesome. Thank you ",
  "[removed]",
  "Whats the thought behind charging to 80% - does this extend overall battery life long-term?",
  "Yes, you can play PC games. Fortnite runs at 100-120FPS on the native screen resolution. Cities Skylines plays well.  I wouldn't expect to be able to run the latest AAA 3D intensive games well, but it can run most of them on low settings but I wouldn't recommend it for that as the fan noise gets quite loud if pushed too hard.",
  "Yes, it's still there as an option on the Lenovo UK website for the Lenovo Yoga 7i",
  "You would have to replace the entire assembly including touchpad",
  "I've used the laptop for a few months now and on the rare occasion that I do need to use the side power button (maybe twice so far), it's worked as it should. I think if the usage of the power button is so low, it should easily last the entire life of the laptop",
  "Yes, it's an option in the power management software to prolong battery health. It's standard practice for all lithium batteries",
  "Am I about to make a mistake? Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i \nhttps://www.lenovo.com/au/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-pro-series/lenovo-yoga-pro-7i-gen-10-aura-edition-14-inch-intel/83kfcto1wwau2\n\nI am thinking if buying this. Cannot for the life of me find a single review directly of this model. Or a related one with different specs. It's all Slims and 2-in-1s. \n\n\nWHY AM I LOOKING AT IT?\nNot for gaming, other than maybe a light cozy thing here or there. It's so I can do office type and browsing functions while I am on the move and potentially some light music production. \n\n\nThin and light would be good. Want to be able to carry it around without hassle. \n\n\nNeed a good battery life but not insane. 8 hours would be fine. Sales tech said this would get at least 10. I'd reduce the refresh rate to 60hz, I won't need 120 most of the time. Presumably that'll eek more time out. \n\n\nBest I can tell CPU should be pretty future proofed. Seems basically as good as it gets for this category. \n\n\nRAM is confirmed by sales tech as dual channel. Unfortunately there doesn't seem an option to do 64gb instead which would give me future proofing comfort. \n\nBut as far as I can tell the RAM (LPDDR5X-8533MT/s) is basically top of the line for portable laptops. \n\n\nWHAT AM I WORRIED ABOUT?\nMain thing keeping me from pulling the trigger is glossy screen as I like bright rooms and sitting outside haha but... seems like nearly all of then have that. I assume I can maybe put a screen film over it of some kind? \n\n\nSecond thing is overheat potential. Without reviews on this specific configuration, seems a risk the ultra 9 285H might get SPICY. I presume I can maybe manage this by reducing power in the settings...",
  "Idk about this model specifically as I'm researching a 2in1 to purchase, why are all the Lenovo 2 in 1's so much more expensive than their pro counterparts?? My local retailers won't even stock them as their price is just absurd.\n\nAlso, because these brands make multiple laptops of the same format with different specs, usually have to look at them as a whole, then the changed specs individually. Look for reviews on the yoga/yoga pro (compared to other brands, some great reviews and minimal complaints), then make sure the cpu is good.",
  "Hmmm. Interesting. What region are you in? I'm in Victoria Australia and here it seems like the 2 in 1s are pretty affordable, they just use the less heavy duty specs (Vs instead of Hs). \n\n\nBut yeh that's kind of what I've had to make do with RE reviews. Kind of gettins the vibe of similar names and judhing it off that. My exact thoughts on it. The complexity of the seemingly similar but not quite same laptop models with different nearly the same name and completely different specs has made the review space completely fucked to navigate hahaha.",
  "Im in QLD, I should have clarified for the same specs, the 2in1's are more expensive. Currently I'm trying to find specs for a version JB hifi sell but Lenovo have removed completely from their website. Of course they do that and JB don't specify.",
  "To be fair JBs laptop prices are uniformly atrocious hahaha. They charge amounts for specs that are several tiers below what that price point should provide. I think their target market is mostly people who know nothing about computers haha",
  "That's true, but jb for at least one of the models is the exact same price as Lenovo website, without the 3-5 week wait.",
  "Yeh they sometimes might be ok generally, but i notice A lot of the lenovo website prices themselves are inflated. \nLike the one I posted is apparently 40% off, as are other ones im considering which are slightly less speccy, full price of 3.2k or so. But the literal same laptop at a retailer like HN or Office Works is like 2.3k full price. \nSo lenovo website on sale is a genuine sale price but not on sale they're wildly expensive.",

  "It seems quite expensive for having integrated GPU.

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "A quick analysis of Lunar Lake characteristics in 7i Aura and Zenbook S 14 Hi all,\n\nI've had an opportunity to test the Zenbook S 14 and the Yoga 7i Aura as I'm looking to upgrade my laptop, and have come across a few things in reviews online that struck me as interesting and that I wanted to dig into. I did some additional (admittedly very quick) analysis that dug into the performance/power characteristics of these two laptops on battery in a \"office/everyday\" style workload.\n\nThis was inspired by Notebookcheck's excellent [Power Consumption During Everyday Use](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Lunar-Lake-CPU-analysis-The-Core-Ultra-7-258V-s-multi-core-performance-is-disappointing-but-its-everyday-efficiency-is-good.893405.0.html) section, which found that, despite Lunar Lake's middling multithreaded performance per watt, it excelled at \"everyday\" power consumption, beating AMD's strix point platform by around 55-60% (\"Just under 9W\" to \"just over 14W\"), which explains why Lunar Lake does resoundingly beat Strix Point in battery tests (excepting where there are major mismatches like 1800p OLED vs 1200p IPS).\n\nFirst - at least a few tech reviewers concluded that the efficiency of Lunar Lake wasn't that great based on performance per watt measured running something like Cinebench. While pretty much all of the tech reviewers do great work overall, I don't think that's really the best way to measure power efficiency of a laptop designed for generally travel oriented scenarios where you might be looking to be on battery life frequently, or doing more Office Style work compared to hardcore video rendering. This definitely does not mean that nobody would do that kind of work on Lunar Lake, but that performance per watt at full load is, in my opinion only half of the story.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n1. Out of the box, Asus runs a lower power profile on battery than Lenovo, making up for OLED Battery life and giving you some good runtime numbers, but giving a bit lower performance.\n2. Lenovo has a much better cooling implementation than Asus.\n3. Lunar Lake's ability to avoid getting into \"full tilt multithreaded 100% load\" during everyday scenarios are why you see so much better battery life numbers than AMD Strix Point. IMO, it's an excellent chip for how most people use laptops.\n\nI took a look at the Asus Zenbook S 14 and the 7i Aura in PCMark10, the only office style productivity benchmark I had that was free, and compared their outputs on the standard out of the box profile (what most consumers will probably pick), and on power. First, the table:\n\n[A link to the graphs provided by HWInfo logging](https://imgur.com/a/8sI3xzv)\n\nDISCLAIMERS, particularly as I didn't originally gather this data to put into a mini-review, nor do I have time to be as rigorous as I should:\n\n1. I've only had time for about 3 runs on each of these, selecting the middle run.\n2. Runs were accomplished by opening Discord, letting the computer idle for 5-10m, and then executing PCMark. They were supposed to help capture \"My use\" (which will always involve having discord open), not best case scenario benchmarking.\n3. The computers were left to only focus on the benchmarks, no Discord/other usage during them.\n4. Avg Discharge Rate, shown in the battery chart, represents what I think is HWInfo's gauge of total system power consumption including the display and any other relevant components. It is, however, not nearly as precise as CPU Package Power - I think it's a trailing metric that I occasionally saw *less* than CPU Package Power during transient power spikes (going into rendering, for example). Still, in aggregate, I found it a useful metric.\n5. I did not measure the brightness of each screen for Discharge Rate - i set them both to about 50%. In hindsight, I think the 7i Aura gets quite a bit brighter than the Zenbook, so this might be a disadvantage to Lenovo.\n\nPlugged In:\n\n|Notebook|Avg CPU Package Power|Avg Temp|Max Temp|Score|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Zenbook S 14|9.26W|57.5C|93C|6680|\n|Yoga 7i Aura|9.1W|48C|85C|6870|\n\nAnd Battery powered, balanced plans:\n\n|Notebook|Avg CPU Package Power|Avg Total Discharge Rate\\*|Avg Temp|Max Temp|Score|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Zenbook S 14|4.36W|7.5W|44.74C|75C|4694|\n|Yoga 7i Aura|5.52W|8.97W|42C|83C|5166|\n\nOne of the interesting things I'd seen in some reviews, such as [Just Josh's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4MnS3Zzwa8) review of the 7i Aura, is that, even with an IPS Display, the 7i Aura was doing slightly worse than the Zenbook S 14 with an OLED Display. Based off of this, I can at least partially understand why. In it's \"standard\" profile, Asus seems to run Lunar Lake at a lower power level than what Lenovo has selected - less power consumption and less performance. There isn't a lot of media analysis of what power profile laptops pick on battery - only what their battery life is, without trying to measure performance to go along with it. This helps put things in perspective (at least for me).\n\nI wish I had a Strix Point laptop to do comparable comparisons to, or a Meteor Lake laptop to do last gen. I'd love to see reviewers look into the power profiles of laptops on *battery*, not just plugged in. It is, after all, a major reason that we purchase laptops! And while I wasn't initially stoked with Lunar Lake's plugged in multithreaded efficiency, I think I'm pretty impressed coming away from this. I could write a whole separate piece on how much better Skymont seems to enable the entire platform compared to Crestmont from a gen ago.\n\nI still have both laptops, so let me know if anybody wants to ask any questions.",
  "Thank you for this! I was debating which lunar lake laptop to get and this helps me lean more towards the Lenovo.",
  "The Yoga 7i Aura's display, like the Macbooks, has a glossy screen, but the Macbooks have some kind of antireflective treatment behind the glass that makes them easier to view in daylight.\n\nDoes the Yoga 7i display have any sort of antireflective treatment behind the glossy exterior?    \n  \nI'm asking because I have a lovely Yoga 7 16IRL8 (i7-1360P), which has great display colors and touch, but at 400 nits max and mirror-like reflections (0% antiglare), it's basically unusable during peak daylight.  \n  \nBtw, recently I learned that screens with touch capability cannot have antireflective treatment, because it interferes with the touch digitizer, however I'm dying to know if the Lenovo Yoga 7i Aura is better in that regard.",
  "Totally agree with your views on Zenbook cooling… I’ve had my new S14 for a week and CPU temp never drops below 60C even when idle. The fans (on all modes) are running always after 5-10 mins of the laptop starting. Whisper mode is good, but of course you’re compensating with less power draw and performance.\n\nI took it to Asus for inspection and they said it’s normal. Perhaps it is, but either way I think it’s a design flaw with how compressed everything is that air simply doesn’t flow through well.",
  "Thanks for this, interesting results! Do you have any knowledge regarding performance when it comes to editing 4k video and similar?",
  "still debating between these two laptops. Looks like the zenbook as a more premium feel (weight, materials, ...).   \n  \nI feel like the yoga slim 7i aura would be the right choice, but does it \"feel\" good (premium) ? You said the hinges are much nicer on the asus, does it full cheap on the Lenovo ?   \n  \nAlso, what do you think about the IPS screen? Is it a big step down when compared with the oled panel ? \n\nHuge thanks for this comparison and all this info !",
  "When it is plugged in, is there any difference between \"balanced\" and \"performance\" modes? How do they differ? Which do you recommend using?",
  "Those were my two finalists, and because I heard so much problems with Asus' service in case I have problems, I went with the 7i equipped with 258V CPU. Getting it tomorrow!\n\nThanks for the coverage!",
  "Yeah, I kind of think the Lenovo does the same thing”big things” better, and the Zenbook does the same thing”little things” better. \n\nLenovo in its default battery state runs the CPU a little stronger while still staying cool and quiet because its cooling system is better. The energy saver mode still feels subjectively fast while basically turning off P-cores and relying on skymont, and gives you access to a VERY efficient power draw. Asus’ default profile kind of falls in between Lenovo default and Lenovo energy saving. The screen gets nice and bright on Lenovo, and even if the webcam isn’t great, windows hello works well. It also has dual side USB-C. The trackpad and keyboard I give to Lenovo by a little bit. \n\nThe asus has a better weight distribution profile, feels lighter, and has a MUCH nicer hinge. Speakers are good. OLED display is good, but it doesn’t get as bright. But I think the Lenovo laptop has a better power profile for default, while still letting you access the energy saving one. \n\nI plan to test Asus’ energy saving mode to see what the difference is, if any. I’m curious if OEMs have any control over which cores to favor during energy saving. For lenovo, energy saver heavily gates P-cores while boosting E-core usage. I am curious how much asus might differ, or if it is fully controlled by Intel. ",
  "It definitely doesn’t seem to have an anti reflection coating. Here: https://imgur.com/a/neLlarq \n\nThe screen does go a bit above 500 nits. The above dimmer photo is around 75% (probably close to the 400nit display youre talking about) and the second one at full brightness. \n\nSubjectively, I found the full brightness perfectly visible as long as the sun itself wasnt reflecting on what you were trying to look at. ",
  "Yeah. It's been a while since I've had two laptops side by side to bench, but it really highlights the tradeoffs between a functional design (the Lenovo, in my humble opinion), and a great looking design.\n\nThe zenbook is hands down better looking, and *feels* better to use because of stuff like a smooth hinge and better weight distribution that really up the portability factor. I really wish the Lenovo had the Asus hinge, as it's just about the only thing I hands down prefer on Asus. The OLED screen is nice too, but honestly, I think the Yoga has a really nice IPS - it's plenty bright and colors still look good. I briefly had an MSI Prestige 13+ AI Evo, and *THAT* screen looked fantastic (albeit 60hz) - it was bright, and the colors punched much better. But the Zenbook OLED screen - while it looks great, didn't really punch as hard as I \"expected\" a laptop OLED screen to.\n\n  \nI had to return the MSI because of an ultimately faulty display (it kept shutting off), but when it WAS briefly on, it looked great. Mini review - it has great portability given its size and weight, but the cooling is absolutely not up to par; the fan was so loud. Maybe MSI's default settings use really high power settings (I couldn't bench much on account of \"not really working screen), but whatever it was, the OOBE wasn't quiet.",
  "Unfortunately I don’t have anything like a 4k editing flow to try so I wouldn’t be able to tell you. I do some photo editing for my mirrorless and can try and spin that up this weekend. Normally it’s something I do on my m1 MBA (which i acquired before getting heavily into photos). \n\nSubjectively, LNL has been quite a bit snappier than my m1. ",
  "The Zenbook \"feels\" more premium. Hinge, weight, and just general \"vibes.\" I think the Zenbook might be a bit better at overnight power draw as well, so Lenovo might have some background processes waking things up more often. Haven't dug into this yet.\n\n  \nThe Lenovo feels more functional. Better keyboard. Better trackpad (imo). Not sure on speakers, maybe worse? Not something that's important to me.  Much better cooling and noise profile.\n\n  \nThe hinge - I wouldn't say it feels cheap. It feels *sturdy* - it takes two hands to open and has no wobble at all. But lacking the one handed opening tuning does take away a bit from feeling premium. IPS screen - honestly I think the screen in the Lenovo is great. It's IPS but it also gets much brighter than the Asus and can look very comparable. Maybe my eyes just suck, but I wouldn't complain about it.\n\nYou can also get the Lenovo for cheaper than the Asus. I paid $1336 for mine with a 6% discount from Lenovo's website for 32GB/1TB. I think if you e-mail subscribe, you can get it for another $50 off on top of that. The equivalent Asus is $1500. So up to you if the $200+ is worth it.\n\nI think they're both excellent PCs with different targets - the Zenbook feels like they made a goal of \"make a great PC, *but* it has to look and feel like a Macbook Air competitor\" - with all of the strengths *and* caveats that a design goal like that implies. The 7i Aura feels like the goal was \"make a great PC.\"",
  "I think for me one of a very small feature in Lenovo is kind of must have and Asus definitely misses on the same. Having USBC charging available in both sides of the laptop is something that brings in lot of flexibility when using the laptop. IPS display on Lenovo is good as well so I don't miss having OLED. Overall performance of the laptop is little better on Lenovo.",
  "Performance mode raises the PL1 TDP for both laptops by a reasonably substantial amount. The Lenovo stays pretty cool and quiet even under full load. Asus is definitely audible. \n\nTo be honest, my normal workload on my laptop isn’t bad. I’m either programming for side projects or editing RAW photos (my camera does 24MP. The balanced performance profile of LNL (and indeed basically any modern laptop) offers plenty of 1T performance for tasks like that so I don’t stray from it. \n\nA friend of mine stress tested both computers in heavy code compilation - i.e. compiling a heavy GCC based toolchain. Lenovo was significantly cooler and quieter and very slightly faster over ~an hour of work. ",
  "Thanks! The big things that I like about the Lenovo are:\n\n1. I can put the screen flat at 180 degrees, whereas I believe the Asus cannot do that.\n\n2. It has an HDMI port and USB-Type A port whereas the HP Omnibook Ultra Flip does not.\n\n3. Nice keyboard.\n\n4. Performance seems to be slightly better than the other lunar lake models possibly.\n\n  \nDo you know if the Thunderbolt 4 ports support DisplayPort 2.0? It should. I plan on connecting it to my 4k Dell monitor through USB-C.\n\nWhen it is plugged in, is there any difference between \"balanced\" and \"performance\" modes?\n\n  \nWhy are there no reviews posted online yet besides a couple youtube videos? Is it still under embargo? The asus has reviews everywhere.\n\nI plan on ordering the 32gb RAM version but was hoping to see a few reviews from major online websites to just make sure before I make the purchase.",
  "Thx mate for the great writeup ! One thing is - are the zenbook S14 speakers better or the Lenovo Aura ? \n\nI've heard some conflicting things about the Aura speakers. A few tech youtubers say the Aura has some of the best speakers (on par with like the Asus G16s ) and others I believe like Just Josh stated they were really poor (it gets loud but very muffled/muddy treble )",
  "By \"Lenovo energy saving mode\", do you mean the one in Vantage, or Windows power profile, or the Windows battery saving mode?",
  "Thanks OP!",
  "I love the zenbook design, but I can’t stand the constant fan noise and CPU heat. I’ll likely try and sell it given I can get an M3 Air for less than what I paid for the zenbook. I’m disappointed tbh!",
  "Thanks! I am considering one for on the go laptop since I don't really like the Apple ecosystem. I'm a creative who would edit photos and video on the go, but no one has really talked about that in reviews yet from what I've seen.",
  "thank you very much for your detailed response !!",
  "Big question : Should I buy a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i 258V now, or wait beginning of 2025 to see the new models (and probably new chips) ? In other words, wait for Arrow Lake or buy Lunar Lake ? Thanks !",
  "How do the \"balanced\" vs \"best performance\" modes in Windows differ from the Lenovo \"adaptive\" vs \"performance\" mode in Lenovo Vantage?",
  "Yeah, asus is limited to 135 degrees. \n\nI’m not sure about HP, but the asus and Lenovo have the same port setup minus lenovo having usb-c on both sides (big plus). \n\nNot sure about displayport 2.0. I can say that my Thunderbolt 3 dock from work will drive the display port cable at QHD 100Hz and a second monitor at QHD 60hz (this one is hdmi). I have the lg 27gl850, so it’s a bit of an older display. \n\nMy understanding is Intel and Asus mostly seeded the Zenbook to reviewers. I can partially see why - the zenbook really is a looker, and i find myself “wanting” to prefer it over the Lenovo. The yoga feels like a very good but kind of boring implementation. Definitely function over form - there’s nothing exciting about its aesthetics, but the functionality is definitely better engineered. The zenbook can definitely still turn your head though. ",
  "Would it be worth it to wait for the OLED version? On one hand I love the blacks but super worried about the flicker.",
  "I don’t fully remember because I don’t have either PC anymore, but i was probably talking about the one in Vantage. Different laptop manufacturers either link their power profiles towindows’ corresponding one or sometimes keep them separate and I can never remember which is which. ",
  "Yeah, Apple still has an excellent CPU in the M3 (and eventual M4) chips. I had an M1 macbook air and decided I wanted to upgrade because the bargain deal I got in a 256GB 8GB M1 wasn't doing too hot, but also I've had more time to play games on the go these days, and I no longer need the programming advantages a Unix like system affords me.\n\nIf I didn't have games in my workflow, I'd probably be considering an M3/M4 macbook air. That said, if you're in the Windows camp, I still come away pretty impressed with Lunar Lake. I'd chalk the fan noise up to Asus' design choices; the 7i Aura is much quieter and cooler at load and on battery.\n\n  \nEdit: On your comment about price, I will say that at least IMO, MacOS is no silver bullet for RAM usage. It might be more efficient than windows, but I do feel like my 8GB MBA can get bogged down pretty easily in plenty of use cases. A 16GB MBA with 512GB SSD comes in at the same price as a 32GB 1TB Zenbook, and a good bit more than the Lenovo 7i Aura.",
  "I don't think the  equation fundamentally changes that much with new laptops/models; they're going to have the same general performance profile. \n\n  \nArrow Lake's biggest advantage over older chips is power efficiency which should bode well for gaming type stuff in laptops (not so much desktops, RIP). But if LNL fits your usage profile and the lenovo fits your budget, then I'd just go for it now.",
  "I use an external monitor most of the time so it's not a big deal for me. Plus, the reports I've seen have shown the OLED versions to have worse battery life.",
  "Has it been confirmed there will be a OLED version of the Lenovo Aura, especially here in the US ?",
  "Huge thanks, will proceed :) !",
  "Well, the OLED model was initially announced with the other Lunar Lake laptops, but it seemed to have been delayed until early next year.",
  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget €2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years. As longevity is important, I believe performance is an important criteria. My current setup is an 8th gen Intel i5 Asus laptop (8/256) and a M4 Mac Mini (24/512) on the desk. I want to replace both of these items with a single Windows laptop and I'll sell the Mac. I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around €2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. €1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. €1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. €1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. €2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. €2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** €2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",
  "Have you ruled out Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024 or 2025)? It is a cheaper Asus ProArt with the same of internals.  These Asus model carry the best speakers of all Windows laptops which is nice to have if you have kids or others to share a screen.",
  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",
  "Question: why are you listing high refresh rate laptops? Is that something you want?\n\nBecause I doubt you’ll max out that refresh rate in games unless you play older games or competitive online games.\n\nEdit: nvm just saw you don’t care about games.",
  "Have you considered a HP ZBook?",
  "T14 Thinkpads",
  "Update: Added the Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) to the list",
  "I did but seems a little difficult to find them not overly priced in Ireland.",
  "I'm doing some research on the P14s this morning.\n\nDirect from Lenovo I can get the Ultra 9 185H, no operating system, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 3K IPS display for €2370.\n\nA local retailer has the Ultra 9 185H, Win 11 Pro, 32GB RAM, 1TB performance SSD, 2560x1600 @ 90Hz display for €1790.\n\nI don't think the better display is worth €600.",
  "Also, unlike the ProArt you don't need to pay for a 4070 you said you wouldn't be using much. The 16:10 screen is also good for web development with it's bit of extra height. P1's are also pretty much the top of the Thinkpad scale, being workstation laptops and thus very solid. P1 gen 7 is also 17mm thick and 2kg so pretty portable.",
  "You're right, I never game but do appreciate a nice smooth screen. High refresh rate is not a must have but more a nice to have.",
  "I will take a look, thanks",
  "Thanks. A lot of praise online for Thinkpads",
  "ASUS Zenbook S14 vs. Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura 15 vs. LG gram Pro 16/17 - which would you choose?

  "Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 10 vs Yoga 9i (14\" intel) Normally I answer these questions for friends and acquaintances but I am a bit stuck right now.\n\nI'm not asking which one is better. Rather, better for my use case.\n\nI need a new laptop. After reviewing many options and I'm down to the **Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 10** vs the **Yoga 9i** and I'm on the fence. The Yoga 7i is the first runner up thanks to the  i7-1255U processor and the Dell XPS 13 was a close second runner up.\n\nBoth with similar specs are around the same price. (16 GB, Display WUXGA touch)\n\nThe main differences are that the yoga has the i7-1260P processor, 1 TB SSD and it seems that a larger battery. The X1 Carbon the i5-1240P, 256 GB SSD, and a lock slot. Any of those processors, even the  i7-1255U is suitable for what I do. SSDs are cheap so I can get a larger one if needed. Battery life is important and security is important.\n\nI use it with Linux so Linux compatibility is important. The X1 Carbon comes with Linux but it seems that the Yoga 9i has good compatibility.\n\nI am traveling a lot and like to bring the laptop along. Last 6 months we backpacked through many countries cities carrying my girlfriend's Dell Inspiron 2 in 1. I love the form factor. It has good specs but the exterior bent in one corner. Also at 1.63 Kg it felt a bit heavy as we carry max 10 Kg in total so cutting down 0.5 Kg (1 pound) seems meaningful.\n\nSo, knowing that here are my questions:\n\n* Is the Yoga sturdy enough to backpack?\n* Is the X1 Carbon as sturdy as it seems?\n* Is the battery life in the X1 Carbon with a \"P\" processor really as bad as the reviews say? Between 4 to 8 hours of real work.\n* Is the battery on the Yoga as good as the reviews say? Between 8 and 10 hours.\n\nThanks"
