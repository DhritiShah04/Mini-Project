  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",
  "This is why I'm planning to upgrade my X1 carbon g5 to g13. It will be expensive, but it will be worth it I hope.",
  "i have one, i love it and find it enjoyable but im not a lappy connoisseur like you ive only had desktops for last decade, i will monitor this touchpad thing and touchscreen issue, but i use a bt mouse mostly, and i dont have this glow on the screen, or not that i notice, everything else seems manageable\n\ntry one more replacement, what other options are there right now? i dont think it looks or feels cheap. i like same things as you, the usb c on both sides, i like the weight and solid feel, the shiny bright screen, speakers, fast solid bt and wifi, keyboard, low bloatware, amazing battery and playing gta v\n\nmy bt 5.3/4 can let me use my earphones all the way in the shower room which i couldnt do with my previous 5.1 or whatever, thats big life immprovement for me\n\ni feel the top function row of keys the backlight bleeds through the bottom of the row a bit much depending on angle but not a big deal",
  "This is a very interesting review. Currently not many reviews for this model. Have you got chance to try other Lunar Lake models?",
  "Nice review! Would you mind sharing how the Aura's screen compares to the SL7 you previously had? And how the fan noise in the SL7 was for you in the same setup you mentioned with external monitor?",
  "Thanks for this insightful review.\nRegarding the fan noise, is it possible to use tpfancontrol (or more recent) to customise it ? On both T15 (Gen 1) and L14 they work well to start the fan sooner than the firmware does, but I do not know whether it is possible to delay the fan startup...\nThanks,\nP.S. : additional question : what is the lowest rpm that tpfancontrol can achieve ?",
  "I noticed a big difference in performance after uninstalling the bloatware. Battery is great, response is snappy, touchpad is fine, not great, screen is lovely.

Best non Mac I’ve ever owned, and I think the x1 carbon will be better in terms of build quality but couldn’t see myself doubling the cost for materials and same specs. \n\nAll in all, a very solid, reliable piece of equipment.",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",
  "For me, the biggest issues so far:\n\n1. Occasional phantom touches - similar to the OP\n\n2. eGPU compatibility (GPD G1) - it used to work with meteor lake laptop which I had (YogaBook 9i).

  "  \nI have had this laptop for a week. I have updated everything that needed updating (Windows and all relevant drivers). Everything is fine except for the Wi-Fi, which is very slow. I usually connect it to my phone’s hotspot (an S23 Ultra), and when I tested it with Ookla Speedtest, the download speed never exceeded 180 kb/s (0.18 Mb/s), while the upload speed reached up to 4 Mb/s. It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do? I bought this from BestBuy in the U.S., but I’m currently not in the United States. While returning it is not impossible, it would be very difficult, and I would prefer to resolve the issue without having to return it.",

  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues.

For example, unless it's one of the newest MacBook pros, you might be used to an incredibly glossy screen that leads to a busted user experience if there are windows or uncontrolled lights nearby.\n\nMy M1 Max MacBook Pro was also incredibly laggy for things like window snapping and some other things where I couldn't get rid of the animation and you just have to wait for part of a second from time to time before you can do things.\n\nPretty amazing that it compares to a multi-thousand dollar laptop, but also multi-thousand dollar laptops these days can be pretty disgusting, or at least that has been my experience with the M1 Max, and some Windows laptops from Dell, Asus, and Framework being laggy with windows 11.\n\nMaybe it's just a software problem though and I shouldn't be comparing wildly inefficient operating systems like Mac OS and Windows 11 to things like debloated Windows 10 or Linux on a 12-year-old Thinkpad originally rated for 24 hours of battery life.",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "How do the speakers compare to the MBP?  Thx",
  "I currently have the G16 and the aura and when it comes to speaker quality, these two are pretty close. the G16 has a slightly fuller bass and slightly wider sound stage. In my opinion if the G16 are a 10, the Aura speakers are a 9.5. I also feel the browsing experience to be much better on the Aura. I experience more lag on the G16 and the fans kick on, the SOC can get too hot for the G16 to sit on the lap, even with light browsing. That being said the track pad on the G16 is better. while the keyboard on the Aura is much better",
  "I was thinking of buying this but it has way too much bass, since I listen to music a lot that's a dealbreaker for me. Also, the bass resonates across the laptop body which creates a weird sensation if you're typing while listening to music. I tried adjusting equalizer in dolby software but still couldn't get the sound right. Did you find a solution to eliminate bass (so chassis doesn't resonate) and music becomes clear?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "I just did, looks good from any angle.",
  "Thanks for your review. I finally decided not to buy this model (it's in my cart for a few days).",
  "Thanks for the insight. Where did you see others complaining about the touchpad issue? If it's not isolated to my machine I'm afraid it may be drivers / firmware.",
  "sounds like an issue with Intel ultra series 2 to be honest.  \n  \ncan anyone who has tested other series 2 intel laptops confirm?",
  "I wud return it for the annoying spinning wheel alone",
  "I wish the X1 carbon line still had good IPS panels. OLED isn't for me. P14s gen 5 has a nice 120hz 3k IPS, I might consider that one.",
  "Hey, I'm thinking of picking up this machine, but I'm curious to know how much battery life you're getting?",
  "Haven't tried any other Lunar Lake laptops as of yet. There will allegedly be a SL7 for business with Lunar Lake next year, thinking about waiting for that. Though knowing Microsoft they'll charge an arm and a leg for 32Gb.",
  "I also posted a review of SL7 a few months ago if you wanted to have a look. The SL7's display is pretty comparable to the Aura's. It had worse PPI (201 vs 222), and worse subjective calibration making it bit washed out, but didn't have the IPS glow issues of the Aura. The AR coating was also better. I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve. The chassis would get way too warm in heavier tasks and the fan would hardly do anything. But still, I prefer the SL7's acoustics. No noise in a docked setup.",
  "Cant seem to get it working on the Aura.",
  "What did you uninstall? ",
  "Which bloatware did you remove?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "Thanks for the recommendation on uninstalling the bloatware.  Any update on the laptop?",
  "It's annoyingly reflective. And it's a pitty because under the perfect conditions it's really nice to look at. But it's a laptop so conditions change and are rarely perfect",
  "Is it a problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "The low RPM noise isn’t too bad, it’s just the fact it’s there at all that irks me. It’s completely unnecessary to have such an aggressive fan curve with a Lunar lake chip inside, but I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker. \n\nThe eye strain comes from the GPU, not the glossy display surface. Same strain when docked. Seems to be recent intel GPU’s from what I’ve read, causing issues for those sensitive to dither, or whatever rendering technique it is that causes the pain.",
  "The Aura screen dimensions are compatible with the MacBook Air 15. Get a MBA 15 compatible matte screen protector, and it'll greatly reduce glare and reflections on the Aura.",
  "was this 16 or 32gb of ram?",
  "BTW, as an update to my experience, I have my touchscreen replaced as it seems to be touchscreen issue instead of touchpad. For a week, touchwood, no such touchpad issues anymore.\n\nThe only remaining gripe I have would be the lack of compatibility with my GPD G1.",
  "Have you uninstalled McAfee already? It will greatly improve system performance. The Microsoft antivirus software built in Windows is better. That's probably the first thing to do after unpacking a new Lenovo laptop.",
  "It's really subjective. Do you have any issues with other modern devices? In laptops I find Intel Xe iGPU's to be bad for eye strain, Nvidia perfectly fine, AMD tolerable but not ideal.",
  "For my ghost touches issue, turns out I went to Lenovo repair centre to have screen replaced, then as of these weeks the ghost touch issue is gone for me.",
  "how did it go? did you send it in and is it still working?",
  "Hello \n\nI am going to buy this laptop soon.\n\nIs there display glare problem a deal breaker?  \nSome people mentioned : glossy displays leading to poor battery life because you have to crank up brightness to max to combat glare.\n\nThanks",
  "Its not easy to buy a laptop nowadays. many models and there are issues on each model. No windows laptop is perfect it seems, unless you pay big amount to Thinkpad series highend one.",
  "Luckily the 15.3\" screen is the same size as the Macbook Air 15, so you could pick up a matte screen protector.",
  "[I just reviewed it](https://smbtech.au/features/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-aura-edition-laptop-review/) and got 26.5 hours. That's a new record on my site.",
  "After using for some time, I think it’s similar to surface laptop screen. It’s reflective but with decent resolution. Colors are vibrant. I mostly work inside so it’s been fine. Working outside might be slightly tough because the screen is pretty reflective (not as good coating as MacBook). If you turn up the brightness to 100% that might make it better for outside work.",
  "I think the same, if not even better.   So loud and clear and good bass too.   I've tested both the 14\" and the 15.3 and had zero issues.  I think the one this person is talking about was just a lemon",
  "Not really, I just got used to it.",
  "Barely but yes. You can be outside (in the shade of course) and make do while in light mode. It's a mirror though, so you gotta find the right angle.",
  "Thank you so much - I really appreciate it. This makes it a buy for me. ",
  "Glad I could help make that tough decision! Not many choices right now that are similar to Yoga 7i Aura Edition but hoping we get some new releases soon...",
  "I read about a couple folks mentioning unresponsive touchpad in some YouTube comments and in r/lenovo comments as well",
  "You probably don't need this anymore but its around 8 hours minimum for demanding stuff, WAY higher with regular use. Much more than one needs. If you plan on using it for several days in a row, just bring the charger.",
  "As I sit here looking at my non-upgradeable to Windows 11 Surface Book 2.  You felt and looked premium, I paid a lot for your middle tier processor, I learned what heat throttling was, sometimes you think the screen is disconnected when it isn't, we had a good run. No more MS laptops for me thanks.",
  "Just read it, some great detailed insights there. Definitely swaying me towards getting the SL7, especially given the low/no noise from the fans which is very important to me. Thanks for replying!",
  "How would you compare the screen reflectivity between the SL7 and the Aura? Still waiting for my Aura to arrive",
  "OK, thanks for trying, it is good to know that it is not compatible... by the way, there are several variants, depending on the model (eg 1 or 2 fans) : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qjlal2/tpfan_control_on_newer_thinkpads_share_your/\n\nOn the Aura, there is also a built-in BIOS configured power management, accessible through Fn+Q command : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1fufeoa/lenovo_yoga_slim_7i_aura_edition_ama/lqcjek5/",
  "What if you set the performance/fan mode to quiet? Does that make it quiet enough? I'm thinking of getting this too and have heard mixed reviews about fan noise",
  "Ya, it’s been hit or miss on battery life. Touchpad gets finicky w longer use, appears to be pretty sensitive to the oils on the skin and any grime so I try to use the mouse. I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",
  "Its actually not too bad in person (at best buy) when viewed side by side to the book 4 screen.   I think the book 5 screen has more anti-reflective coating and they did not have that model for testing.",
  "Is the reflection problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "Does anyone tried this?",
  "It had been on sales for £1100 for the Aura 258V 32GB RAM model in the UK (e.g. Lenovo Store, Currys).",
  "Yes the 32 GB version with Intel 258V. Seems like some of the discounts are now gone.",
  "I have the same ghost touch issue, sending it in for repair under warranty in 2 days.  \nhow was you experience with the repair and is it still working?  \nAsking since i have heard many bad things about Lenovo's repair service.",
  "May i ask if you’ve found a solution for connecting to the gpd g1? I am looking to buy a compact egpu to use with the slim 7i aura on the go. 🙏",
  "That was one of the first things I did",
  "I'm looking to replace an old Dell XPS 9360 laptop with the following specs: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz 2.00 GHz. If I had no eye strain issues with this, do you think I should be ok with the Slim 7i Aura?",
  "Tell me how the type of graphics card can affect eye strain. Eye strain and other discomforts are caused by PWM and temporal dithering. These are defects or characteristics of displays, and intervening components are unlikely to be the cause, but I could be wrong. Please comment.",
  "I exchanged it",
  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast. The screen is very glossy though. if you work in a very bright room with bright background/light behind you, then yeah it can be very annoying to clearly see your reflection on the screen even at 80% brightness. it's depends see if you can find a sample in the nearest store.",
  "I like your little candy cane for scale",
  "Can you share me the settings that you have used while testing this and was there any major tweaks done to this? I got the same laptop but seems like my idle drain is little bit higher, although I did clean install of windows.",
  "Is it good?",
  "HP's new OmniBook Flip looks good, but its battery is a bit small. Maybe I'll wait for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura edition. It'll be very expensive at the release time though.",
  "A few alternatives appeared in recent months:\n\n[**MSI Prestige 14 AI Evo C1MG**](https://smbtech.au/features/msi-prestige-14-ai-evo-c1mg-laptop-review-2024/) – MSI’s, matte-screened 14-inch, business-oriented rival is larger, but more powerful.

  "Ah, interesting. Looks like a universal issue then.",
  "Both are glossy glass surfaces, but I remember the SL7 looked less reflective. The aura can look a bit mirror-like at times.",
  "My bluetooth is awful.  I can pair all devices, but they will NOT stay connected.  My earbuds connected, and I was able to use them for about 1 minute or so, but I could only get the Right side to receive sound.

  "You could try to check if the problem is related to your Windows install, or a hardware issue (e.g. WiFi chip, antenna connection). \n\nOne relatively easy way would be to create a Linux bootable USB stick (e.g. Ubuntu). Boot up from the Linux USB stick and check the WiFi speeds. \n\nIf the speeds in Linux are normal, you could then try a \"clean install\" of Windows (download Windows USB install media from Microsoft website).\n\nIf the WiFi speed in Linux is also very low, then it might be worth opening up the laptop and checking the WiFi chip and antennas (does not void warranty). Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",
  "Did you exchange with the same model? Or what else did you get instead?",
  "Understand it looks like a deal breaker to me, however spec is really good on this pc.",
  "this comment is making me crack up ideky",

  "Now I'm thinking to just get the Yoga Pro 9i with the IPS. Should check all the boxes. Just not the battery life",

  "If it's dropped like that again it will be Number 1, or very near it. Prices are a rollercoaster at this time of year and there's not much in it. There's a whisker between these and choosing what suits you best will leave you with a great laptop either way.",
  "The 9i looks like a nice machine especially with mini-LED, but the chassis is quite cheaply made, like the Pro 7. All plastic interior, including the hinge assembly.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

So you may have to try the links a few times. \n\nIf you have good WiFi speeds with an external USB WiFi dongle then this is also indicative of a hardware issue. I suggest you find a friend who can help you check out the WiFi inside your laptop.",
  "For the benchmarks, i go for the max possible score. I'll have Windows Set to Best Power efficiency and the Vendor's app set to maximum efficiency (no overclocking, USB charging turned off, silent mode if not low power, disable diacreet GPU if relevant etc).

  "hi I am someone using this laptop for a month. Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully.

  "Lenovo Yoga 7i Gen10, 14-inch laptop (2025) review **UK-based Laptop Review**\n\n**1. Title:**  \nLenovo Yoga 7i Gen 10 (2025) Review: power and portability\n\n**2. Introduction:**\n\nThis is a review for the 2025 yoga 7i gen 10 model from Lenovo with intel core ultra 7 258v and 14 inch screen. I bought the configuration from the UK Lenovo website with 32GB RAM, 1TB SDD, 2.8k OLED 120Hz screen, Luna Grey colour and optioned the fingerprint scanner for an additional £10, paying £1090 in total (including the 10% VIP discount for healthcare workers). This is a premium grade 2-in-1 consumer laptop with a solid build, great for anyone who needs a portable and powerful device.\n\nI haven’t seen many user reviews for this particular generation of laptop so thought it would be useful for anyone considering it.\n\n**3. Design and Build Quality:**\n\nThe chassis all metal, which gives it a very solid feel. The build quality is great, there’s very little flex in the case or the keyboard. The body does not pick up fingerprints. At 1.4kg, it’s not the lightest laptop but it’s still very portable. It fits my 13 inch laptop sleeve. I don’t have much use for the tablet mode as I find it too cumbersome when compared with holding an actual tablet. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and the trackpad is smooth and accurate. I appreciate the double height enter key. Coming from the LG gram 16, this is a much better typing and trackpad experience.\n\nPort selection is good. There are 2 USB-C ports, one on either side, with one USB-A, one full-sized HDMI, a microSD card slot and a headphone jack. The power key is on the right side which I’ve mis-pressed a couple of times so I’ve disabled it in the settings.\n\nThe display is a 14-inch glossy OLED touchscreen with 2.8K resolution (2880 x 1800), 500 nits brightness (1100 nits HDR Peak). I find the screen bright and vibrant. Watching video in a dimmed room is fantastic with zero light bleed. Reflections and fingerprints can be an issue, especially when viewing dark things on the screen and there is bright ambient. However it is still useable under these conditions.\n\nThe hinges are solid, with little screen wobble when typing but it does require two hands to open the lid. The look and feel of the laptop is very nice with smooth rounded outer edges.\n\n**4. Performance and heat:**\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 258v is perfectly capable of handling my usual tasks of multiple Chrome/ Firefox tabs, connecting to my remote desktop for work and steaming video content.  I have tried some gaming and the experience with casual  games has been very good. Fortnite runs at 120FPS. Cities Skylines runs great. I’ve tried playing Watchdogs and although it could play it, the framerates were only around 40fps and the processor got quite hot with the fans getting noisy.\n\nThe keyboard and palm rest areas are always cool. The area under the screen gets warm under load but the hot air is blown out through the vents on the back, away from the user which is a good design.\n\n**5. Audio and Webcam:**\n\nThe speakers are fine, they are up firing from the sides of the keyboard and they are rated for Dolby Atmos. I can clearly hear the 3D effects when watching YouTube or Netflix. There isn't much bass but it is acceptable for a thin and light laptop.\n\nThe 5M IR camera is decent for video conferencing. There is a privacy shutter switch just above the camera. Windows Hello usually takes just a few seconds to log me in. I have found the fingerprint scanner works faster, especially when the lighting conditions are not ideal for Windows Hello.\n\n**6. Battery Life:**\n\nThe 70WHr battery lasts all day for me when web browsing/ streaming videos. I use a 100W Ugreen 4-port USB C charger to charge all my devices and the laptop fully charges within a couple of hours.  \n\n**7. Software and User Experience:**\n\nThe OS is Windows 11 Home 64 and comes with some minor bloatware including McAffee Antivirus, Lenovo support/ vantage/ AI shenanigans. The Lenovo Vantage software has some useful features including dimming various parts of the screen to save battery – I only use the taskbar dimming though as I find the background dimming too distracting. It also enables you to switch the laptop on just by lifting the lid, which means the much maligned side power switch is hardly ever used. There have been reports of this power button breaking easily on other models and thus bricking the device.\n\n**8. Price and Value:**\n\nThe base model costs £1000 (£900 for students or those that qualify for VIP member) and comes with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and a14inch WUXGA OLED screen (1920x1200, 400nits, 60Hz). I was happy to pay the \\~£200 premium for the better spec’d screen with double the RAM and SSD. Mine came with a 65W USB-C charger and a stylus pen which magnetically attaches to the lid.\n\n**9. Pros and Cons:**\n\n* **Pros:** Screen, performance, battery life, keyboard\n* **Cons:** Screen reflections, power key positioning.\n\n**10. Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a well-built laptop where the pros far out-weigh the cons. The OLED screen is fantastic and it has been a pleasure watching content in a darkened room. It is very easy to travel with, having all-day battery life and a thin and light form factor.\n\n**Final Rating:** 9/10",
  "Really nice post.\n\nIm looking into this as pretty much the only option as the price is really good compared to others.\n\nIm sceptical about the hinges, but you say they are fine. And also if the performance is okay, if i could spec it id go higher but there arent really any options. \n\nThe next thing is vivobook which goes about 50% more with worse screen",
  "How about the weight, does it feel heavy...do you think it's worth the penny and do you think it's a good investment until 2028 atleast?",
  "Im setting up my 16 inch model right now and the fans are running on low constantly and high pitch too, did yours do the same?",

  "Potentially stupid question...\n\nI'm comparing different Lenovo Yoga 7s on their website,  and nowhere does it say which generation is which... How do you guys know this information?\n\nThere's so many reviews out there 😵‍💫",
  "I'm thinking of getting this laptop but I'm wondering about the CPU performance for things like python and matlab number crunching(data/optimization/small simulations etc)\n\nJust curious what kind of work do you do on it and is the CPU fast enough for that? I'm still not sure whether the lesser multicore compared to a 200H arrow lake is a problem or if I'm overthinking about the 258V",
  "hello, here some questions:\n1. what version of hdmi port does it have?\n2. What components could you upgrade? ssd, battery, keyboard?",
  "Just a question: does the screen have a plastic border, or is it all glass? ",

  "Hi OP, I read a few other reddit posts regarding poor battery life on this particular screen option (2.8K) compared to alot of the youtube reviews (which seems to be based on the 1200 screen option). When you say all day do you mean \\~7 hours? Are you leaving your screen on 120Hz or reducing it to 60Hz.",
  "Hi, I’ve used a Lenovo Yoga 7 AMD from a few generations back with the Ryzen 6800U for the past 3 years and have had no issues with the hinges for what it’s worth!",
  "Thanks. Only time will tell regarding the hinges but they look and feel sturdy to me and these double hinge designs should in theory spread the force out across the 4 contact points on each hinge, reducing the stress at any one point. I'll update if I have any problems with the hinges",
  "It doesn't feel heavy but it's not feather-light like the LG gram. The LG gram can be lifted from a corner with one hand easily whereas I'd struggle to do this with the Yoga 7i. The Yoga 7i   feels more substantial, more premium. However it is still easy to carry around in a back pack.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase so far - it does everything I need and I feel it is good value for what you get compared to an equivalent from HP or Apple. As long as I keep the battery in good condition and the hinges don't break, I'm sure it'll last a good 3-5 years. \n\nIf I didn't play PC games, I would have strongly considered a macbook air 13\".",
  "The 14 inch model doesn't have this problem at all. It's mostly silent. Your 16 inch model should have even better thermal handling given the extra space. The constant fans might be due to all the updates being installed, see how it goes",
  "It came up as an option for me when I selected luna grey as the colour",

The UK lenovo website states which gen it is,  the i is for Intel, they usually have AMD in brackets for AMD models. X means snapdragon. I think the gen 10s are sometimes called Aura Edition too",
  "1. The HDMI port is a standard sized 1.4b\n\n2. The SSD can be upgraded via the M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe SSD slot but that's about it. The RAM is soldered on the model I got.",
  "There is a black border around the screen but the glass extends over it. The border houses the web cam",
  "I turned off the side power button and activated the open screen to switch on option which works really well. It means I never accidentally mis-press the power button and it should last a lot longer",
  " battery life has been fine for me, I've kept it at 120Hz and only charge up to 80%. Off power, I've been using it for 5 hours now, browsing/ streaming at 50% screen brightness and there's still 45% remaining, so that's just 35% battery use after 5 hours of light usage. I would expect at least 12 hours from a fully charged battery",
  "So pc games work on this one? How is the performance, which games did you try out and does it heat up?",
  "Do you still see that option? Cause I don't see it when I want to configure it",
  "Interesting... Yea the Canadian site doesn't mention generation. We have all those versions though.",
  "yea the cpu and size are all included in the full model name, but aura edition stands for the optimized intel partnerships versions that have slightly better battery life and perfs",
  "Is it possible to replace the keyboard?",
  "Awesome. Thank you ",
  "[removed]",
  "Whats the thought behind charging to 80% - does this extend overall battery life long-term?",
  "Yes, you can play PC games. Fortnite runs at 100-120FPS on the native screen resolution. Cities Skylines plays well.  I wouldn't expect to be able to run the latest AAA 3D intensive games well, but it can run most of them on low settings but I wouldn't recommend it for that as the fan noise gets quite loud if pushed too hard.",
  "Yes, it's still there as an option on the Lenovo UK website for the Lenovo Yoga 7i",
  "You would have to replace the entire assembly including touchpad",
  "I've used the laptop for a few months now and on the rare occasion that I do need to use the side power button (maybe twice so far), it's worked as it should. I think if the usage of the power button is so low, it should easily last the entire life of the laptop",
  "Yes, it's an option in the power management software to prolong battery health. It's standard practice for all lithium batteries",
  "Is the ThinkBook 14 i5-10th good?? In the last days I saw a lenove ThinkBook i5-10th with 8 ram 256GB ssd with a price of 55000 which is 240 american dollar is it a deal for a programmer and student for the comming 4 years if it is in a good state??waitig for your answers",
  "Not really.",
  "10th Gen CPU still are good in 2025. Not always need latest greatest. I'm still using xeon from 2020.",
  "make sure it has the IPS panel, not the base 220-nit TN panel.  While it's still FHD, it's REALLY awful looking.\n\nAlso be aware that it uses only single channel memory (no soldered, single SODIMM), so the performance is lower than many other 10th gen laptops due to that.",
  "Ram should be upgraded to 16gb for smooth performance",
  "You'll want to upgrade ram and probably storage. Make sure you can do that before. For the price it's not too bad tho",
  "Yup, it's decent. \nMight want to upgrade the RAM to 16gb some point the sooner the better honestly.\nAnd maybe an external SSD, 256 GB is rather small, but it should be fine.",
  "Outdated but good laptop",
  "The CPU probably is just 10310U. No warranty, and you need to replace (or add) RAm and SSD yourself. Just buy a new laptop with N100, 16gb ram and 512gb SSD. This only costs about 300usd.",
  "💯 YES!",
  "For that price yes. \n\nMake sure to Double check the state of the machine, nothing internal is missing, and Upgrade that RAM if you want it to last longer, especially with how demanding most software is today.",
  "Why??",
  "How i know that ??",
  "Thanks. And can you told me if it is a good choice for a programmer ??",
  "The Ryzen versions are much better.",
  "Short anwser? Yes.\n\nYou'll  need to ask another programmer if you want more info though.",

  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience).

  "Video editing would be OK on any of them with enough RAM and so long as you're not doing 4K or something. If you're doing 1080p or even better, 720p you'd probably be OK, although I'd still want to go up to at least 32GB RAM.\n\nIf you want to do 4K, you really 32GB to 64GB RAM and a better GPU.\n\nThey will absolutely work, but as you, maybe a bit slow.

Thanks\n\nP.S. - I am going to buy the laptop tomorrow so I need quick suggestions please.",
  "I have the Zenbook 14 (mine has the 1920x1200 OLED, otherwise specs as you listed) and would definitely recommend it. In mixed use (some Youtube, web browsing, a couple hours playing 9 Kings) I've been getting 8-9 hours of screen on time out of the battery, and performance has been excellent. Battery might be slightly better or worse on Windows (I am using Debian Linux), but for the performance I think that much battery life is still mindblowing. The hardware is 100% a premium device. If I could do it over, I would buy this laptop again.",
  "Damn, but didnt you consider yoga 7 Pro cuz it has better features otherwise",
  "Been looking everywhere for someone who has this OLED! The 3k doesn’t appear to be available in the UK. Do you have the reported issues with seeing dots on the digital layer for the touch screen? Do you do a lot of reading and typing as supposedly it’s not great for that either?\nFinally, how is wifi 7 card?\nThank you",
  "I did not. The Yoga 7 Pro doesn't appear to be readily available in the US (where I live) in anything close to the spec you listed, so that takes it out of the running for me. I did find a listing for $200 more than I paid for the Zenbook, which doesn't inspire me much. Are the prices for the two similar where you are?",
  "> Do you have the reported issues with seeing dots on the digital layer for the touch screen?\n\nI don't; however, those seem to be reported by people who view a lot of white backgrounds. I just checked out a white background myself to try to look for it and I *think* I saw a little of it on a fully white screen, but frankly the sheer amount of white light was far more offensive than any pattern that may or may not have been there. With anything not majority pure-white I can pretty confidently say it's not an issue.\n\n> Do you do a lot of reading and typing as supposedly it’s not great for that either? \n\nNot sure how a screen would be bad for typing, personally - if this is re: the keyboard, I have found it to be very solid as far as laptop keyboards go. Primary use case for this for me is as a web browsing machine/capable PC on the go, but it is not my main PC. I have not noticed anything that would lead me to say it's not great for reading, though.\n\n> Finally, how is wifi 7 card?\n\nWorks well, though I can't speak to the Windows-specific aspects of it. No complaints once it was up and running (If you're a Linux user, it wasn't detected by the Debian installer, so I had to use a USB-C-to-Ethernet dongle to get the OS installed; worked fine out of the box once the OS install was complete. If you're a Windows user I am sure it will be perfectly fine out of the box.).\n\nOverall, I'm really happy with this laptop. I bought it as a secondary device as mentioned, but I could happily use it as my main PC (outside of graphically-demanding games) if needed. It's got tons of power in an extremely portable form factor with an excellent screen, which is exactly what I wanted from it.",
  "Well well it's even about a 100$ cheaper here the yoga",
  "Really appreciate you taking the time to reply, thank you.\nI think the reading/typing comment was tied to the screen in the sense of it being suitable for that type of work (coding, desktop publishing etc) vs gaming/entertainment, but I’m satisfied hearing from a real world not review world use case. \n\nI’m probably going to go for ultra 7 rather than 9 - my use case won’t really benefit from the extra power when the trade off for the power is slightly less battery time , and more heat and subsequent fan noise. \n\nThat conclusion is also formed from reviews though, so if you’ve an opinion on that I’m all ears! (I will be running Windows)",
  "I may be wrong (going off of the US website as that is where I am based) but it looks like the Ultra 7 variant is the older 155H, whereas if you want the current crop of CPUs the Ultra 9 285H is the only option; from what I was able to find the 155H and 285H get similar battery life, but you get a healthy chunk more performance with the 285H (as you'd hope). If the pricing is similar imo go for the 9. Haven't found heat or noise to really be an issue with this machine anyway (yes the fan can be heard when it's on like any laptop, and yes putting a big fat 16 core CPU into a thin and light chassis like this means the fan will be coming on regularly - that will be the case both with the 155H and the 285H, so I would not consider it a factor in purchase decisions personally). Obviously, if the 155H meets your needs and comes at a decent discount, then it makes sense to go for it.",
  "[Help Me Choose] ThinkPad E14 Ultra 5-125U vs ZenBook 14 OLED UX3405CA **Hi everyone!**\n\nI’m choosing between two 14\" laptops and could really use some real-world advice.  \nI’m a clinical psychologist, and my use case is mostly **work + travel**:\n\n* taking notes during diagnostic interviews\n* writing formal assessment reports\n* online meetings\n* reading scientific articles\n* watching the occasional movie on the go\n\nI might also occasionally do some light video editing (basic 1080p timelines) and play light games during longer trips — nothing heavy, just casual titles to relax while traveling.  \nI value quality, durability, and reliability much more than raw performance.\n\n**Options:**\n\n* **Lenovo ThinkPad E14** — Intel Core Ultra 5-125U / 16GB RAM / 1TB SSD\n* **ASUS ZenBook 14 UX3405CA** — Intel Core Ultra 5-225H / 16GB RAM / 1TB SSD\n\nI’m also open to other laptop suggestions in a similar price and size range — as long as they run Windows (I don’t use any Apple devices and have always been a Windows user).\n\n**Questions for owners/testers:**\n\n* **Durability:** Which one holds up better during travel (backpacks, flights, cafés)? Any hinge or chassis issues?\n* **Noise & heat:** During long Zoom/Teams sessions + multiple docs/tabs, which stays quieter and cooler?\n* **Battery life:** Which one actually lasts longer in real-world use?\n* **Webcam & mics:** Which provides clearer speech for interviews without needing a headset? Does the AI noise suppression make a noticeable difference?\n* **Serviceability & warranty (EU/Poland):** How easy is SSD/battery replacement? Any experience with warranty support?\n* **Light gaming & video editing:** How do these models handle casual gaming or light editing without overheating or throttling?\n* **Longevity:** Which model tends to age better over time (battery health, hinges, keyboard, etc.)?\n\nIf you were in my position — traveling frequently, typing a lot during interviews, and needing a dependable machine for work, study, and occasional fun — which would you choose and why?\n\nThanks a lot!",
  "for light gaming/video editing the core ultra 225h is definitely going to be more powerful than the 125u\n\nin terms of build quality, both are full aluminum \n\nin terms of battery, I would go with the zenbook since although 225h has higher tdp, the battery is larger and if you set it to silent mode, it should be similar \n\ntheres 2 battery sizes for the e14 so check which one it is\n\nin terms of upgradeability then yeah the e14 wins here. 2 ram slots, 2 ssd slots. also assuming since its a more business laptop, serviceability of other components would be better\n\nwebcam for e14 depends on the config, might be 1080p or 720p. if its 1080p they should be similar\n\nlongevity is hard to say but both should be good (i guess e14 due to its serviceability)\n\nthe screen on the zenbook 14 is oled so it will look really good. but if its the 3k oled then yeah battery life will be worse than the normal 1920x1200 version",
  "Thank you! Seems like the ZenBook’s the better travel companion, while the ThinkPad might be a more reliable work machine overall — probably fits my work use better. Still, that higher-res OLED display on the ZenBook sounds great for comfort and everyday use.\n\nBy the way, is it true that ASUS can be a bit worse when it comes to warranty repairs or replacements?

  "Lenovo Ideapad slim 3 gen 10 AMD 14\" So i bought this laptop for £469 in the UK for university and i have had it for about a week now and I have not seen any reviews so i thought i would leave a review. It has a ryzen 5 8640hs with integrated radeon graphics, 16gb ram dual channel and a 60wh battery\n\nBuild quality: This laptop is made of sturdy plastic, the finish feels very nice but it is nothing to boast about, it is good enough for the price. I like how it is very lightweight and is really easy to carry around.\n\nDisplay: The anti-glare coating is great for this and really helps when it is sunny outside and the sun is very bright. 1920x1200 is very sharp but other than that its a regular 60hz IPS panel but it definitely gets the job done.\n\nKeyboard: This one does not come with a full size keyboard but I am not too bothered by this personally as I dont usually use the rest of the other keys. Sometimes I do press the wrong keys but once you get used to it, its a solid keyboard.\n\nPerformance: The CPU in this is very fast, whatever I do happens in an instant whether im video editing, watching videos, playing games or in a meeting. The 16gb ram also plays a huge role in this. What surprised me the most was the performance of the GPU considering its only 15W. I dont play very heavy games but this GPU was able to run forza horizon 4, fortnite, GTA, battlefield 1 and hollow Knight at good fps(these are the games I usually play). I also did some wii u emulation and it was flawless. One thing I will mention is that the laptop can be quite noisy when gaming on extreme performance mode but is very quiet when not being pushed.\n\nBattery: The battery on this is great for what it is. I was able to achieve around 7-8 hours from 100 percent to 20 whilst just doing my assignments(on battery saver). I got around 5-6 hours on netflix. When gaming the max i got was around 3 hours of battery life which is not too bad.",

  "Dont get it, its not worth it at that price point",

  "Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Gen 6: First impressions I purchased the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G6, model 21NQCTO1WWBR1 on July 2025 and would like to make my impressions about this product:\n\nDESIGN AND BUILD: We don't have much to comment on the design, as it's quite minimalist. We're surprised that not all the keyboard keys follow Lenovo's signature layout, as is typical on IdeaPads, but at least the Ctrl and Fn keys are in their traditional positions, unlike ThinkPads. The light color isn't bad, but it's a shame there wasn't a darker color option (not black, which is typically only seen on ThinkPads, but a darker gray would have been nice). The touchpad is a good size. We found the number of ports interesting, but the Ethernet port's position wasn't particularly helpful, being on the right side. It's interesting that it also has an SD card reader. The number of LEDs also caught our attention, with one next to each USB-C port, in addition to the power button itself (which we really like being separate from the keyboard). We liked the backlit keyboard and the dedicated \"?\", \"/\", \"°\", and \"Menu\" keys, although they sacrificed one of the Ctrl keys. At least it didn't come with the \"Copilot\" shortcut. We didn't really like the notch in the webcam area and found it a rather questionable design decision, but we understand its usefulness. We also liked that it came without those infamous labels on the palm rest, just the Intel seal.\n\nSCREEN: We liked the quality of the IPS, but we were disappointed that the screen had excessive IPS Glow at the bottom edge, quite visible with the screen on a black background even in bright light. My brother was okay with it, but I didn't like this defect at all, which I'm already accepting is quite common in current LCD screens, as I've also seen notebooks and even smartphones and tablets from other brands with this issue. It shouldn't happen, but we've come to understand that IPS Glow is now part of the experience of having an IPS LCD screen, which is unfortunate. At least we like the thin bezels.\n\nSOUND AND WEBCAM: Neither impressed in any aspect, but neither disappointed.\n\nBATTERY AND CHARGING: The USB-C charger is interesting. My brother tested it by playing YouTube videos in 1080p with maximum brightness, and it lasted over 5 hours unplugged. For a 60Wh battery, it's an okay battery, but it could be better.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND USABILITY: Regarding performance, considering its specifications, I consider it okay. It worked very well even for running virtual machines via VirtualBox. We didn't notice excessive heat on the keyboard when heavily loaded. My brother installed the Big Linux distro, and in testing, it has worked well, including mirroring the laptop screen to our Smart TV wirelessly. My brother was unable to get BlissOS, based on Android 13, to work, as it didn't recognize Wi-Fi, but emulating Android on Big Linux with WayDroid has worked well most of the time.\n\n**Have you also purchased a Lenovo ThinkBook?

  "I got the same laptop, with 8gb of RAM, and im quite satisfied with it. I use it mainly for college stuff, and it can handle an entire day of coding, browsing the internet and even playing some light games (such as Horizon Chase). \n\nBattery life on it is quite impressive on linux. I get 6-8h of usage with it. That's more than i get with Windows (i have no idea why i just get 3-5 hours on Windows), but i've seen some minor compatibility issues on linux, such as the mute key not lighting up or the volume keys getting \"sticky\" (if i hold it a little bit, it goes to max volume or 0), but overall, the laptop is very usable.\n\nI plan to upgrade to 16gb soon, because on my use case, 8gb is too low, especially when i get 16 tabs open for research + some niche software from 10 years and VScode.\n\nOBS: Você é o CAVBR do fórum Adrenaline, não é?",

  "Intel Core i5-13420H.\n\nIn other countries, Lenovo has already launched ThinkBook Gen 8, but in Brazil (where I live), curiously, it recently launched Gen 6.\n\nIn fact, while in most countries, they're already launching models with the new Intel Core Series 1 and 2, in Brazil, the number of laptops with Intel Core 13th Gen has now increased.",

  "Strongly considering a used Lenovo Thinkbook since it meets all my needs. Was wondering how good they are? So I need a very specific set of features with dual SSDs being one of the hardest ones to meet.  I'm getting closer to a decision though. The Thinkbooks basically meet all of my requirements.  Probably looking at something like the Thinkbook 14 Gen 7. There are other laptops that would work but they all have their own flaws. The Latitude 55xx series have low quality shells. The lighter workstation laptops have poor battery life.\n\nFrom what I am seeing the sentiment is \"don't buy Thinkbook because t series better\".  I'm having a hard time finding much for empirical evidence on why Thinkbooks are bad. \n\nI get they have a slightly lower build quality and the panels aren't as nice. Sounds like the 2 in 1's might have hinge issues but that seems to apply to any convertible laptop. I get the impression Thinkbooks aren't garbage like the L series.\n\nCurious if any actual Thinkbook owners have any advice.",
  "Your day-to-day quality of life is going to be determined mostly by the specs. So in that regard, if a Thinkbook meets your needs, go for it. I will say if I was comparing a Thinkbook with a ThinkPad, all else being equal I’d pick the thinkpad, mostly due to build quality: Thinkbooks aren’t bad by any means, but Thinkpads are in my experience built like tanks, and they have a lot more IT-friendly features where someone who knows their way around a laptop can get a lot out of it. That said, I don’t think thinkbooks have any *glaring* weaknesses that I would warn you against",

  "Good luck trying to get your money back when the laptop is 11 months old, warranty is meant to repair anything what's wrong with the laptop that isn't your fault, not a refund or a replacement, if they offer refunds or a replacement, they won't call that warranty\n\nAnd calling a lawyer??? Unless if they didn't repair your device even if you ask to even if you have some warranty left and the technicians blame you, you have a case, but it's written in the contract if something went wrong that isn't your fault, it's your obligation to tell them to fix it, that's what warranty is, you won't get a case from that, that's the point of warranty\n\nIt says 1 year warranty, probably the store also offer refunds that only last like a one to two weeks, and I don't think companies like these do replacements\n\nJust saying, it's better to get a working device back for free, or still have a broken device where repairing it will cost upwards to $100 to $200 due to motherboard repairs so it's worth a try and lawyer fees will cost much more than the laptop itself too",

I'd love to know what everyone else thinks.\n\nThe main advantage I've gotten so far for the thinkbook is slightly better built quality, upgradability (but the yoga I'm looking at already comes with 24gb ram and 1 tb storage) and a built in finger print sensor.",

  "Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition vs HP Omnibook Flip Ultra 14 Hi all, I had the opportunity to try the Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition alongside the HP Omnibook Flip Ultra 14, both with the same configuration (32GB RAM and the same processor). Many people have asked me about the differences, so I decided to share my impressions! 😊\n\nFirst:  \nSorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language. 😊\n\nThe HP is a beautiful device and smaller than the Lenovo. It also has a sturdier display and a nice design. But it is just personal preferable. However, the Lenovo has better battery life (it lasts me all day if I’m not gaming - really great). In stress tests, both performed similarly, but Lenovo was slightly better. I think Lenovo has nicer colors, and the quick side buttons for performance adjustments became an instant favorite for me.\n\nLenovo has an excellent keyboard, which I prefer over HP’s (though some might find the extra side keys bothersome, I personally find them great). Typing on the Lenovo keyboard feels comfortable. Both have the same keyboard backlighting, but Lenovo’s felt better to me. The stylus is good on both, but the Lenovo stylus feels better in my hand. Writing and drawing on the screen feel the same, though palm rejection on the Lenovo seems slightly better.\n\nGaming:\n\nNeither laptop is designed for gaming, but they can handle lighter games like The Sims without major issues. I believe the HP Omnibook had slightly better FPS, but the difference was minimal.\n\nNoise Levels:\n\nBoth laptops can be quiet. The Lenovo makes absolutely no noise during regular use. Even when playing simple games on balanced or lower performance modes, it remains silent. In contrast, the HP Omnibook always had a faint hissing sound, which slightly bothered me. The cooling system would frequently activate.\n\nHowever, at high performance levels, the HP Omnibook was quieter and more bearable than the Lenovo Yoga. Under heavy load, Lenovo’s fans engage more aggressively and are quite audible. Gaming on high performance mode sounds like a mild vacuum cleaner—similar to a gaming laptop. So, for demanding tasks and intense applications, HP wins in terms of noise control. On the other hand, Lenovo is completely silent during standard usage, whereas HP is slightly audible. HP does ramp up its fans under high performance too, but its noise level is lower or at least more tolerable compared to Lenovo.\n\nTemperature:\n\nAt idle, my Lenovo was around 26-32°C, while the HP was roughly 25-31°C. During standard tasks like watching videos or using Copilot, both reached similar temperatures of 35-45°C, depending on workload. Gaming temperatures reached around 50°C. Overall, HP was about one degree cooler. But under high performance mode, I feel Lenovo cooled slightly faster and better (though the fan noise was noticeable more on lenovo than HP), but the difference was minimal.\n\nSoftware:\n\nBoth come with several pre-installed apps. However, Lenovo Yoga includes two free premium programs (one for drawing and another for notes), while HP does not. Both have decent applications for managing updates and performance settings.\n\nSummary:\n\nBoth laptops feel high-quality and have a beautiful design. They are very similar in performance with identical configurations. Speed is comparable, and they both handled stress tests well (Lenovo performed slightly better, maybe likely due to stronger cooling). Overall, both are solid choices. Lenovo stands out with a better keyboard, fast side keys for performance adjustments (which might not appeal to everyone), two free creative apps, and complete silence during standard use. HP, on the other hand, offers Gorilla Glass, a sleek design, a more compact build, and quieter operation at high performance levels, though its fans are slightly audible even during regular tasks.  \n  \nI decided to keep the Lenovo Yoga. For me it feels better.\n\nLenovo Yoga has undergone military durability tests, but HP felt slightly more solid to me (though this is just my impression). Both are excellent laptops, but Lenovo Yoga seemed to offer more for the price.\n\nPlease note that this is a personal review, not a professional one. Everyone has different preferences, and my assessment is based on using both laptops simultaneously. However, it is difficult to judge them fully, as I only had about a day to test them both on the same time.",

The Lenovo caught my eye but was more than I wanted to spend so I didn't really pursue it much.  Upon returning to the store after watching some reviews online I went back to the Omni book pulled up YouTube on the highest resolution and was very underwhelmed by the video quality and screen refresh rate.  I also was not a fan of the low travel keyboard on the omnibook.  I returned to the Lenovo and saw it discounted to $1349.  I also considered the ZenBook s 14 but they did not have this on display and it was so close in price I went with the Lenovo.  After unboxing and set up I'm very happy to say I made the right decision.  OLED 120hz 3k screen with 32g RAM and Intel ultra 7 hit all my boxes and hope to keep this computer for many years.",

  "I was skeptical bc I always hated Lenovo computers. Most of my previous employers CPUs were Lenovo. Took a gamble bc of the additional features & glad I did. Absolutely love the Pilot AI too. It's fast, came w/ a stylist, the dark blue out cover was sleek and no tacky. Has enough space to store anything, hasn't froze up at all & I can have several different tabs open and the computer still operates as it should.

  "A brief review of the HP OmniBook X Flip 14 2-in-1 with AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 This is a very brief review of the HP OmniBook X Flip 14 2-in-1 with AMD Ryzen AI 5 340. I don't have the interest to do a full review, and there's plenty of big reviews already out there, so here's the quick version.\n\nHere we go.\n\nI got this laptop for $350 as a Best Buy Open-box return. That was a great deal. I don't think I would pay more than $550 for this laptop but it looks like it's mostly listed between $600-$700 right now.\n\nIt's a lower-mid range laptop that isn't terrible. It would be great for school, work, or if you just can't afford anything better.\n\nThis is a Model 14-FK0013DX, SKU 6613861, UPC 198990145419, BSIN JJGQJRKGHK, Product ID B5UJ0UA#ABA, Product # AK5G4AV_1.\n\nhttps://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-omnibook-x-flip-14-inch-2-in-1-laptop-next-gen-ai-pc-pdk-ak5g4av\n\nThe AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 CPU is a pretty great value. It's performance is better than expected with 6 cores and 12 threads, but it's GPU is a little below average. I'm sure you can play some games, but this isn't a gaming laptop. Unfortunately, the higher CPU performance seems to come at the expense of battery life, but that's not a terrible tradeoff to make. Get a battery bank.\n\nThe 512GB NVME drive in mine is a full size 2280 WD SN500, but you could end up with a Samsung or something else.\n\nThe screen is average. You get what you pay for here and I can't complain for the price. It's a little grainier than I would like, the colors are okay but not great, and the brightness is okay but not great, but it's a good value panel.\n\nThe body is very nice. It has a good look and better-than-expected feel. It is a little heavier than expected.\n\nI am a Linux user, so I don't even bother mentioning any potential Windows issues. You should always do a full reinstall anyway to wipe out all of the crappy OEM bloatware.\n\nAlmost everything worked perfectly in the Linux distros I've tested. Be sure to use something recent. The touchpad, keyboard, and Wifi won't work well without a recent kernel. The one thing that wasn't working was fan sensor reporting, but other thermal information seemed to be correct.\n\nPhoronix has a review of a similar laptop if you want benchmarks. I imagine the results should be very similar\n\nhttps://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen-ai-5-340\n\nhttps://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-krackan-point-windows-linux\n\nIf you want to boot linux, go into the UEFI and enable Boot Options > Enable MS UEFI CA key and disable Secure Boot.\n\n\"Word of warning - disabling Pluton can break suspend/resume\"\n\nThe ports are fine. There's no Thunderbolt, but you get a USB4 port. I wish there was a USB-C port on each side for charging from the right.\n\nFlipping the lid open could be easier. There's nowhere to catch your finger onto to pry it apart.\n\nThe touchpad is a good size and clicks great. The surface is a little rough and it's plastic instead of glass, but it works.\n\n[The one thing I will complain about is the keyboard. I hate it. If you are a touch typist just get something else. If you are slow and don't care, then it's fine.](https://old.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1mytqff/the_hp_omnibook_x_flip_14_14fk0013dx_keyboard_is/)\n\nThe power button is on the keyboard, displacing the DEL key. I hate that too.\n\n~~And finally, the FN key has an LED light that never goes out. It's bugged. There's even a thread about it on the HP support site. You can't turn it off. What's the point other than wasting power and being annoying? Nothing.~~ UPDATE: I was wrong about the annoying FN key LED. It turns off as long as you have it set to \"Auto\" in the UEFI. However, the meaning of \"Auto\" is very unintuitive. It's definitely annoying when it's on though, and there's a reason why almost every other manufacture keeps the two keys needed to turn it on far away from each other.\n\nOver all, this is a pretty good lower-mid-range convertable laptop with a terrible keyboard. If you care about the keyboard, don't get it, or any other laptop with a latticeless keyboard. If you don't care about the keyboard, wait for a sale in the $450-$550 range.",
  "Honestly, the only real downside I noticed with the HP Omnibook X is the display. It’s fine for day-to-day stuff, but it’s not super bright and kinda struggles outdoors. Also, no OLED option so if you care about deep blacks or really punchy colors, this might feel a bit underwhelming compared to other laptops in the same price range. For a machine that nails battery life and performance, the screen feels like the one corner they cut. IDK why! these snapdragon powered devices doesn't work well!",
  "The colors are terrible. The red is orange. I put my color tuned display next to this laptop and the red is totally ORANGE. It's not even close to red.\n\nThe green is a little yellowy and the blue is kind of cyan.\n\nIt works for work but I wouldn't want to use this thing for personal stuff like pictures and watching videos.",
  "Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i 14 (Ultra 7-Windows 11 Home-32GB-1TB) I just bought my new Lenovo a week ago, and there are several things I like about it, but the most important ones for me, such as battery life, are starting to bother me. According to the website and reviews I've seen, the battery should last more than 8 hours with normal use for web browsing, Netflix, and so on. But every time I unplug it and it's at around 90% or 80%, it says there are 5 hours remaining. On the other hand, I started hearing metallic noises from the chassis when I pick it up or move it. I don't know if this is normal, but I'm thinking of returning it and switching to a Macbook Air. Considering that I paid €1,099 for the Lenovo, I could get the Macbook M4 for a similar price.\n\n\n\nMy use of it is quite simple for now: web browsing, multimedia, office automation. General student use and perhaps work. That's why I feel that the Macbook is a better option, considering the battery life, which is the most important thing for me.\n\n\n\nAnother thing the Lenovo has is the 3k OLED touchscreen, but I don't really use the touchpad...\n\nWhat do you guys think? Should I return mine and buy a Macbook Air 16ram 216/512 SSD?",
  "Which one did you get, was the problem there initially? Or it you faced it much later on",
  "Hi, wgich reviews did you see?",
  "How is the battery life now after 3 months, have you found any solutions to make it last longer?",
  "Anyone using new Lenovo ThinkBooks G8? I've noticed them showing up locally. They are cheaper than preexisting laptops but they come with plain DDR5 RAM and \"basic\" 45% NTSC 1920x1200 screens (much better screens listed on Aliexpress SKUs).\n\nI'm kind of tempted to get one and dump 128GB RAM on it so it will be able to load some LLMs for testing (won't be fast but it should run).",
  "hello , did you end up buying it? if yes how was your experience using it ?",
  "Yes, I have the 14\" one. It's pretty solid, I like the palmrest/keyboard. I'm yet to switch the RAM and SSD moving to Linux and final setup. What I don't like is the bottom firing speakers that are lacking even vs basic Lenovo laptops with top-firing configuration (I have old ARM Lenovo and it's better while having original price of a chromebook :P). Thermals/noise is good on light/browser use as well. The screen seems fine while specs on paper don't look impressive :)\n\nNote that now TongFang GX4/5 entered EU stores (under custom names usually) and it offers up to Ryzen 9 with better screen while also having 2x SODIMM and 2x SSD and same or lower price.",
  "I found one g8 7 255h , 32gb , 1tb for 650$ is it good?",
  "What you want to use it for?",
  "Coding , deep learning, maybe some gaming",
  "iGPU can do light gaming, it's good for coding, while AI/ML will be limited to iGPU/CPU but as it has 2x SODIMM it can handle more RAM. For longer coding work you may look at external displays or the 16\" model. For 14\" you can also check local pricing and availability on TongFang GX4.",

  "Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review I bought this Chromebook about a week ago from  Curry's in the UK as the top spec had a deal on for £599.\n\nMy honest opinion using it for my business is that it nails it with only one downside. \n\nI run my own business Functional Drinks Club which has bricks and mortar stores and an online store. \n\nI'm also a Fractional CMO for a UK based tech company. \n\nI hate the Apple OS and eco-system, so Macbooks are always out for me. \n\nAnd I hate how even the best window laptops can get slowed down with anti-virus software and other various plug-inside just to keep them safe while I'm working from different locations. \n\nSo, the Chromebook was always going to get my interest. \n\nWhat I mainly use it for:\n\nShopify Store Management\nMeta Ad Management\nSocial Media Managament\nG-Suite (Pro Business Account)\nSocial Media Creation (FB, Insta, Tik Tok, LinkedIn, YT) \nQuickbooks Accountant Software \nVideo Call Meetings \nCanva - Design needs\nRiverside.Fm for video podcasts and basic editinf\nHubspot CRM Management \n\nI can safely say that it nailed all of the above with aplomb, and because I like to be mobile it's the perfect laptop (not just chromebook) for my business. \n\nNote: I don't do heavy, complex video editing as part of the above.  \n\nThe only downside is that when it comes to printing shipping labels from shopify it only recognises known brand names when it comes to label printers. \n\nThere is a workaround extension for it, but it's a pain in the butt if I'm honest to get working.\n\nThat's it. \n\nI use the Chromebook as my day to day now and I'm not going back.

  "Review of the Tuxedo Infinitybook Pro 14 gen 9/ Skikk Green 6 AMD/ TongFang GX4IDL I bought this laptop a couple of days ago. I bought the Skikk Green 6 AMD. Short specifications:\n\n* 14\" Matte Retina 120Hz 2880x1800\n* Ryzen 7 8845HS\n* USB-C ports with Displayport 2.1 and USB PD\n* 2 x M.2 2280 Port\n* 2 x DDR4 SODIM slots\n\nThis laptop is the TongFang GX4IDL and it is imported by various companies into the EU under different names. These laptops are typically exactly the same. There could be differences between bootloaders, but I expect not. Companies differ on options like RAM, SSD, keyboards and the included charger.\n\nThese are the variants I found:\n\n* Skikk Green 6 AMD\n* [Tuxedo Infinitybook Pro 14 gen 9](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-Pro-14-Gen9-AMD)\n* [PC Specialist Lafite AI AMD](https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/notebooks/lafite-pro-IV-14M/)\n\nI paid 900 Euro excl. VAT and mine came with:\n\n* 1TB Samsung 990 Pro SSD\n* 32GB 4800MHz nameless DDR5\n\nFor approximately 150 Euro more there is an Intel variant available.\n\nI was in the market for a 13 - 14\" laptop with a powerful CPU and I don't need a discrete GPU. I need 32GB RAM and preferably extendable. I use the laptop mainly in the office connected to USB-C docks and I use Ubuntu. So decent support of USB-C in Ubuntu was a requirement.\n\nAt first I tried to find a Lenovo, Dell or HP, but that would run quickly up to 1500 Euro easily. For the given specifications this laptop is a great deal. The enclosure feels sturdy, little flexing and good looks. It isn't super premium, but certainly not lower consumer grade like Acer, Asus or MSI laptops around the same price point. It is not so sturdy as my previous Lenovo bricks. I dare not to lift the laptop by its screen.\n\nThe retina IPS display is beautiful, vertical viewing angles are good. Horizontal slightly worse, but both very good.\n\nI'm not  a keyboard fetishist so the only thing I can say about the keyboard is that is works well. Unfortunately Skikk only sells the ISO variant of Querty without a Euro sign on the 5. Tuxedo gives you the choice between ISO and ANSI for Querty.\n\nThe touchpad is fine, comparable to higher end consumer touchpads, not even close to Apple. Disable touch when typing is not working great in Ubuntu. I haven't looked into this issue yet.\n\nThe webcam quality is good. IR cam is available for Windows Face ID.\n\nI haven't tested battery life, but my expectations are not high. The battery is small and the CPU power hungry. In Windows the battery charging thresholds can be managed. In Ubuntu unfortunately not. This will degrade the  battery quickly.\n\nWhen browsing the web and using office, the fan doesn't spin up most of the time. When it spins up it is nicely regulated. It only spins up to full speed if you start CPU intensive tasks. The noise is acceptable then.\n\nPros:\n\n* You get a semi-premium laptop with a lot of CPU horsepower for a low price\n* 95% support in Ubuntu\n* 5 USB-ports! (of which one on the back)\n* 2 of the 5 USB ports support Displayport and USB PD\n* Almost no crapware installed out of the box\n* 2 RAM slots which fit a lot of RAM\n* Silent until you release the Ryzen 7 beast\n\nCons:\n\n* No max charge level for the battery in Linux\n* There is only one LED to indicate both running status and charging status. When charging you cannot see the running status\n* When the lid is closed the LED is under the lid and not visible, this is annoying for dock users\n* Skikk offers no ANSI Querty\n* The whole laptop feels a bit warm\n\nTo conclude, I'm pretty happy that I found this laptop. I hope that his TongFang can meet the durability of my past Lenovo laptops.\n\nI took some photos of the laptop, a photo with the webcam and photos of all UEFI boot menus. You can find these photos in [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lS5pbprS2M)\n\n**UPDATE after 5 months of daily usage:**\n\n* I'm still very happy with this laptop. In the last couple of months I also bought a Lenovo LOQ. The built quality of the LOQ is bad compared to this TongFang.\n* Found a weird bug: If I restart in Windows and then go into Ubuntu during startup (GRUB), then the Wifi card is disabled in Ubuntu. If I shut down in Windows and cold boot into Ubuntu, I never have this issue. So I need to remember not to restart to switch from Windows to Ubuntu.\n* The webcam image quality is pretty bad.",

  "I haven't stressed the battery yet. I use it docked to USB-C 99% of the time. Just some occasional meetings or couch usage. I will run a battery test.\n\nI am still very happy with the purchase. Only downside until now is the slower Wifi. USB-C displayport works nicely under Ubuntu, better than with my previous Lenovo T480. \n\nMy config has 1 x 32GB DDR, I would have preferred 2 x 16GB to enable dual channel. So I'm satisfied so far.

  "With a 65W USB power brick you achieve full performance. Keyboard is fine. Touchpad is average, no complaints.",
  "Yeah, I'm still happy. Love the performance. I recently ran into 2 issues. At its highest speed, the fan makes a high pitched noise. I only noticed it when I was using the laptop on my lap and I was probably blocking the ventilation holes at the bottom of the laptop. Another issue is when playing music at the highest volume, something near the speaker starts resonating causing the audio to sound extra distorted.",

  "1. I don't think the amount of VRAM can be set.\n2. Secure boot can be disabled.",
  "I can check this for you tomorrow.",
  "Not fancy to do so! 🙃",
  "Maybe one additional question. Can you charge it with a power supply that is not 100W (5V/20A)? Have you tried with e.g. 65W? Some laptops have a problem with that AFAIK.",
  "Not bad at all! Thank you for testing that!",
  "Thanks! Would you still say that it works 95% in Linux, or has that number changed for you?",
  "Thanks. I ended up buying one and found out that the VRAM can't be changed. I tried using Smokeless\\_UMAF, but this didn't work either (this has worked on all of my previous laptops).

  "Most Honest Review of the Lenovo Yoga 7i – Only 3 days in*  \n\nKeep in mind I’m only three days into my new purchase of the Lenovo Yoga 7i 14, but so far I’m really impressed. After returning my M2 Macbook Air Last October, I had been in the market for a new laptop for quite some time, and the Yoga was always something I was considering. The no touchscreen on the Macbook Air simply wasn’t cutting it for me, which is why I ended up returning it despite my relative investment in the Apple ecosystem (ipad pro m1, iphone 12 pro, airpods pro)\n\nMy model: i7 1255U, 16GB DDR5 Memory, 512GB SSD\n\n**Performance:** So far, the performance has been great. Not sure if it’s the marketing gimmick, but the evo certified i7 CPU is quick and extremely responsive in ways that my desktop isn’t. For quick tasks such as opening your apps from the taskbar or simply interacting with the Windows UI, it’s a very snappy chip that has yet to disappoint whatsoever. The 16GB of DDR5 memory is also impressive here, and I’m able to keep dozens of tabs open on Microsoft Edge without any hassle. Definitely think the upgrade was worth it in this sense, 8GB just never seems to cut it these days.\n\n**Display**: One of the best features of this laptop, and is Dolby Vision certified. It has a really nice looking and glossy 2K resolution that looks great from writing documents to watching Netflix–you can definitely notice the upgraded resolution in this sense. I’ve heard some complaints about the display being too glossy, but I prefer it over a matte finish because it feels nicer to navigate on when in touch mode (although it *can* become a fingerprint magnet at times). \n\n**Keyboard:** Keeping this section short and simple. The BEST laptop keyboard I’ve ever typed on. When I first tried it, I was shocked at the switches’ tactility and it was honestly a bit harsh but I’m getting more used to it. \n\n**Trackpad:** Not the best. One of the few downsides of this laptop. The material feels nice, but its touch sensitivity could be improved. \n\n**Battery Life:** Also, not the worst but could be better. I’ve been using battery savings mode on Windows 11 which has seemed to mitigate some of the battery life issues I was initially having. I believe Lenovo advertises over 10 hours and I’m just not sure that’s accurate for my workflow.\n\nOVERALL: Great laptop, 2 in 1 functionality is awesome and feels really polished with Windows 11. Stone Blue color is also awesome and would recommend it!! 4.5/5 overall.",
  "Just got a Yoga 9i myself, also came from a MacBook. \n\nHaven't even had it for more than 24 hours yet, but so far, really can echo a lot of the points you made. Amazing screen, build quality, and speakers. The stylus support is an added bonus as I markup PDFs quite frequently for work.\n\nIf I had to pick a complaint, would be around battery and efficiency. It's not bad but not great either. Expected a bit more battery life and less heat/fan noise. Its early on, so hard to put a great gauge on it. \n\nGreat 2 in 1 all around though, pretty satisfied.",
  "Really nice to hear what you had to say. I just ordered the 14\".  I customized to go 16G RAM. My first (new) Lenovo. I fell in love with a refurbished Flex 7i but it was buggy.\n\nMy brother is an Apple use (phone, pc, etc.) and this is the first time he's not talking smack about my choice.\n\nI'm over here with fingers crossed.",

  "Danke für deine Erfahrungen. Ich wünschte ich könnte auch die Erfahrungen über mein Geräte teilen aber dieses kam nie an und seitdem ärgere ich mich über den Kundendienst rum.\n\n**Meine Erfahrungen zum Lenovo-Service:**  \nIch habe vor über 8 Wochen bei Lenovo eine Bestellung aufgegeben, bestehend aus einer Laptop-Tasche und einem Tablet. Das Paket wurde zwar geliefert, jedoch war nur die Laptop-Tasche enthalten – das Tablet, das auf dem Lieferschein ebenfalls ausgewiesen war, fehlte.\n\nSeitdem habe ich mehrfach den Kundensupport kontaktiert, um das Problem zu klären, und wurde jedes Mal mit standardisierten Antworten abgespeist, die offensichtlich nicht auf meinen spezifischen Fall eingehen. Es wurde mir wiederholt geraten, bei Nachbarn nachzufragen, obwohl ich von Anfang an erklärt habe, dass das Paket bei mir angekommen ist, aber unvollständig war.\n\nNach wochenlangem Hin und Her bekam ich schließlich die Anweisung, einen Polizeibericht zu erstellen, damit eine Rückerstattung oder Ersatzlieferung erfolgen kann. Diese Forderung ist vollkommen unangemessen, da es sich hier nicht um einen Diebstahl oder Verlust handelt, sondern um ein Versäumnis seitens Lenovo.\n\nLaut geltendem Recht trägt der Verkäufer bei Verbrauchsgüterkäufen das Risiko für die Lieferung – es liegt also in der Verantwortung von Lenovo, die vollständige Lieferung der Ware sicherzustellen.\n\n**Fehlender Kundenservice:**\n\nDer Kundensupport scheint automatisierte Antworten zu geben, ohne auf den individuellen Fall einzugehen. Trotz klarer Schilderung des Problems wurde ich immer wieder mit unsinnigen Vorschlägen abgespeist.\n\n**Unangemessene Forderungen:**\n\nDie Forderung, dass ich als Kunde einen Polizeibericht erstellen soll, ist nicht nur rechtlich fragwürdig, sondern auch eine Zumutung. Es ist nicht meine Aufgabe, die Fehler von Lenovo zu korrigieren.\n\n**Verzögerungen:**\n\nSeit fast acht Wochen warte ich auf eine Lösung. Statt den Fehler umgehend zu beheben, werde ich mit bürokratischen Anforderungen hingehalten.\n\n**Mangelhafte Kommunikation:**\n\nEs gibt keinerlei proaktive Updates oder klare Lösungswege. Stattdessen muss ich als Kunde ständig nachhaken, nur um erneut enttäuscht zu werden.\n\n**Vertrauensverlust:**\n\nNach dieser Erfahrung bin ich nicht nur enttäuscht, sondern habe das Vertrauen in Lenovo als Unternehmen verloren. Ein solches Verhalten ist weder kundenorientiert noch akzeptabel für ein Unternehmen dieser Größe.\n\n**Fazit:**\n\nIch habe das Gerät vor 8 Wochen bezahlt und warte seitdem auf die Lieferung des Tablets oder eine Rückerstattung meines Geldes. Der Kundenservice gibt sein Bestes, mich immer wieder abzuwimmeln.\n\nDieser Umgang mit Kunden ist schlicht inakzeptabel.\n\nIch kann Lenovo nach dieser Erfahrung niemandem empfehlen und werde selbst in Zukunft keine Produkte mehr bei diesem Unternehmen kaufen.",

This thing is brand new and i have it on battery saving mode at all times with the power settings set to conservative. In 2 hours the battery goes to nothing with me only doing light tasks like web browsing or YouTube. Outside of that I type and do office tasks. Had this laptop for 5 months. I'm worrying about battery bloat since I charge it so often. Its a shame that nothing can come close to the Macbook battery life.",

  "How do you think it compares to the Flex 7i? Making the decision literally right now. My three options are: MacBook Air M1-226 gb, Lenovo Flex 7i- 1 TB and Lenovo Yoga 7 -512 gb. Yoga is $50 more then the other two, but if it’s a better laptop that’s no big deal. I’m hesitant on the Mac cause I’ve never used MacOS. But I’m trying to figure the difference on Yoga vs Flex",
  "I have an 82yn and when the laptop is working it has been great. HOWEVER, mine has so many problems with it. I consitently run into driver issues with the touchpad and speakers. I have to constantly reinistall drivers mutliple times a day to ge the speakers working probably and for my touchpad to work at all. It fucking sucks. Also, Lenevo support fucking sucks. I sent the laptop to them all they did is factory reset my machine and then sent it back with exterior damage to the chasis. I have a very big dent on the front left of the laptop. I spent hours on support for them to finally say they were going to fix the damage for free and I had before and after pics, then they fucking blue balled me right at the end and said they were not doing it for free and going to charge me like 530 bucks to fix the chasis and hinge, which were both damaged in tranist or during the initial repair. This laptop could have been great but I will never be buying a lenovo product again.",
  "Heyy, how's the hinge and hardware holding on?",
  "how is it going? looking into buying one",
  "Still feel this way 2 months later? Looking to get one",
  "Technically you can't delete MS Edge on any Windows machine without any command prompt workarounds - so yes, to answer your question. Regarding \"bloatware,\" the only thing that comes stock with the yoga is the Lenovo vantage which you can easily remove.",
  "yes, they all are there, but the debloat apps exists and work to some extent.. if your workflow does not require windows, stick to mac. I have my Yoga 7i with every cell of my body. Absolute garbage in terms of battery life.",
  "RAM, Hard Drive space? Yes.\n\nGPU? No. Most laptops are designed for their very specific components. While an M.2 and RAM chip are the same size, most laptop GPUs vary and one won't fit in the same physical space as another.",
  "And I'm curious about the battery, is it better?",
  "I got a 16” 2023 (2k screen 400nits, i7 1360p, 16 gb ram, 1tb ssd) because I found a great deal on it and I’ve been using it for a week. I just came back from the library after a 8 hour session (10 AM - 5:45 PM) and still had 25% battery by the end. I was running the screen around 75% of the screen brightness and had 2 desktops with 2 separate edge windows, 6-7 edge tabs open, MS word and OneNote. I run both the intelligent cooling mode on Vantage and balanced performance mode on windows but I do limit the maximum CPU in windows power plan to 50%. For my use case of note taking, browsing, writing papers it does not slow down or lags. Sorry for long review lol but I was trying to find an objective review before I bought it and I couldn’t find any, hope this helps tho. \n\nI love my 16” 2023, the pencil is a plus for me to take notes and screen is a beauty to use. I’m upgrading from a base 2020 M1 MBP, I sold it already and I also sold my 2020 iPad Pro since I can just carry around my Yoga 7i instead of both laptop and iPad. Glad to be out of the apple ecosystem!",
  "Return it, mine does not freeze at all.",
  "I have a Toshiba satellite P50-C bought around the same time as yours and I''m considering this one as a replacement (I know my Toshiba won't last good too much longer). What's your impression on the Lenovo?",
  "Funny I came here looking for things to watch out for on my new yoga I finally treated myself to after more than a decade which was a Toshiba Satellite as well haha. So far I'm really loving mine this past few days, but then again I'm coming from an ancient machine hahaha  I just got open box for 200 so I'm leary if it has issues I just have not personally found yet.  For the price, I am going to ride it our regardless as it is in warranty, and most likely extend the warranty on it just to be sure because I really like it a lot.  I accidentally left it in the bag turned on in my car in blistering heat while I was at work and it survived that I guess lol",
  "I really loved the Flex - it was just used & buggy. After looking at a ton of reviews and videos & articles, I'm hearing that the  Yoga 9i is the cream of the crop. My fingers are crossed.\n\nMy *uneducated* wager would be on the Yoga 9i. I will try to come back and let you know when I get it (estimated to be on the 25th). But go over and look at both. When looking at specs, you can go all the way to the bottom and there will be a link for \"full specs\" for whichever build number you are considering. I saw an exhaustive PDF on the Yoga I got.[ for the Yoga I got.](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/Yoga/Yoga_9_14IRP8/Yoga_9_14IRP8_Spec.pdf)\n\nIf it helps, see if you qualify for LifeMart (through insurance or employer or veteran, etc). I saved almost $300 because my United Healthcare Insurance offers a LifeMart membership, Never even heard of it before now!",

  "is still good? how are the hinges holding up? do you have the link of the laptop?",
  "Hi. Is this the 2 in 1 convertible you’re talking about? If yes how is the hinge on that? Also any additional points you’d add to this review ?",
  "Hasn't been anymore not sure if it was from an update I did to bios or what",
  "I really like it!",
  "I still have never had an issue (knock on wood). Hope you enjoy yours!",
  "I ended up going with the Lenovo Yoga 7i, the rep for Lenovo told me good things about both told me they were pretty similar but I got a really good deal on the Yoga 7i. Thanks for the help tho!",
  "Yes it's the 2 in 1 convertible. Hinge has been fine and absolutely no issues, it is sturdy and doesn't wobble a lot. \n\nNothing new to report, just that battery has been consistent to about 7-8 hours each day and that is more than enough for me to go to class, take notes and then review at the library until 6 PM. It's a little heavier than my old 13\" M1 MBP and the battery does not last nearly as long that (I would need to charge it every other day - newer MacBook laptops are crazy for battery life), but the bigger screen, the USB-A ports, nicer keyboard and pen support is what makes it 100% worth it for me. And also for a fraction of the price for the Apple equivalent.",
  "Thanks! That’s so good to hear!!",
  "I'm looking at reviews of the 7i now. How do you like yours?",
  "Just echoing the person below in wanting to say thank you for responding! Really appreciate it",

  "Dell XPS 13 vs HP Spectre 2-in-1 14 vs Samsung Galaxy Book 4 14” vs Lenovo Yoga 9i/7i Im trying to figure out what laptop to buy and its been driving me nuts for weeks now. I am a graphic design student and just need something to get me through my last year of college. \n\nMy requirements are:\n16+ GB of ram\n512+ GB ssd\nWindows os\nIntel or AMD\n14”\nDecent battery life\nSomething lightweight enough to carry up a bunch of stairs without breaking my back\n\nIm downgrading from a Lenovo Legion 5 Pro 16arx8, which I only had for a year. It was suggested to me by one of my grad student TA’s, and honestly I regret it. It was just too heavy for me to carry and I only used it for indesign at that point because it was just easier to use my ipad for photoshop and illustrator. \n\nThe battery life also sucked, only lasting maybe 4 or 5 hours when I have 3 hour studio classes, so on top of having to lug around a 5 pound laptop, I had to constantly have the brick of a charger with me too.\n\nI dont want to go through that again, and Im really hoping I can save some money by buying used. Im in a college town so theres a lot of people selling their barely used laptops for cheap, and these are just my strongest contenders. \n\nDoes anybody have any other recommendations or maybe advice? \n\nI tried r/suggestalaptop but I only got recommended the Acer Swift X and its a bit expensive for me and I’m constantly reading bad reviews about Acer as a brand.",
  "ThinkBook 14 Gen 7 vs Yoga 7i 2-in-1 - Help! Hi, looking for some feedback on the two Lenovo options below and whether the Yoga 7i is worth the additional $600 CAD.

I will need the ability to extend on multiple monitors and connect an external mouse and keyboard.\n\nI am quite certain the ThinkBook will be more than sufficient for my needs, however some of the features of the Yoga seem intriguing as well.

  "Not much of a competition here.  The 7735HS basically wins in every measurable statistic.  They have similar CPU performance, but the 7735HS does come out on top.  The 7735HS iGP is nearly double the performance of the 210H.  And while neither will ever be mistaken for a high efficiency CPU, the 7735HS will deliver slightly better battery life when all else is equal.",
  "I was thinking that they weren’t too different. Good to hear that the 7735hs is better cause the laptop is cheaper right now. Is there any other lenovo or any other laptop under $1k that you would recommend for college/light gaming?",
  "So, just to make extra sure I'm understanding correctly since I have the same question, it's the gen 7 that comes out on top?",
  "It'd be worth looking at the E series ThinkPad.  Probably a little more expensive, but the Gen6 AMD or Gen7 Intel that should be available if you're not in the US offers a massively nicer display (optional) to the ThinkBook.  If in the US, then probably nothing you're going to find will be significantly better in this price range since the 2.2K display isn't offered here for the G6 AMD, and the G7 Intel is taking FOREVER to be released here.",

  "How is Lenovo thinkbook as compared to Lenovo slim? Hey all,\nI am considering of buying Lenovo thinkbook with Intel i5 (13gen P processors).\n\nBut I see Lenovo slim 3i in similar price range, and available on Amazon, whereas lenovo ThinkPad after having better specs as well, isn't much popular over flipkart / amazon.\n\nAm I missing something??",
  "ThinkBook is the more sturdy built and reliable business series. IdeaPad Slim is the more sleek and modern looking, but also more frail consumer design. The \"general\" modern consumer prefers a slim and sleek look over performance and durability these days. That's why ThinkBooks are less popular.",
  "Ok, but when I read about thinkbook, posts in reddit mention it's not that sturdy, as compared with ThinkPad.\n\nAny thinkbook reviews here?",
  "That's because there's a large, devout and old ThinkPad following. And the laptops used to be really solid. But if you check out the r/thinkpad sub, you'll find that the recent years ThinkPads, especially the slimmer designs, have as many complaints as their consumer Yoga or IdeaPad line.\n\nHaving said that the ThinkBook line has also gone through a big transition. Everything approximately before Intel 12th gen was a lot more experimental. The last two years, however, have significantly improved on design and usability. So, the current ThinkBook line (from Intel Ultra and AMD Zen 4+) exemplifies again what a good workstation level laptop should be like. Check out reviews yourself on YouTube.",
  "Thinkpad is a different class, it is sturdier, yes, but it is more expensive, obviously.\n\nHowever! Keep in mind that if you don't expose your laptop to frequent shocks and bumps and drops.. a regular Thinkbook will be just fine, it is not a fragile laptop by any means, it's just that Thinkpads are more massive and heavy.. at least the ones I owned until several years ago..\n\nMy advice - don't go for the most expensive with durability in mind! Laptops can fail you regardless of their price! Go for the cheapest that fulfills your configuration requirements. If it breaks, it breaks.. but chances are it will last just as long as a much more expensive one. As I said, I owned multiple Thinkpads.. yes, they feel (and Are) sturdy.. but the hardware (e.g. motherboard) can give up the ghost just as easily as a cheap one....\n\nI've recently bought the Lenovo V15 G4 IRU... 400 euros... i5-13420H... not the prettiest of the bunch, but .. it just works, the CPU is fantastic, IPS display... And it works well.. stays cooler than most of their 2-in-1 or slim laptops because of poor cooling in such small form factors. And if it fails down the road a few years from now... I won't regret the investment... but as I said... laptops are pretty much the same on the inside.. don't pay insane prices just because the outside is metal or other \"mil spec\" features... it's just a case, a housing... the inside is more or less the same.",
  "Thank you very much for the detailed review, I checked the reviews on YouTube, it was slightly confusing, thanks for clarifying.",
