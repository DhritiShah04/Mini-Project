  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Would you recommend this for gaming? Lenovo Legion 5 OLED 15IRX10 I'm planning to buy a new laptop for gaming and work. And I found this new laptop. What do you think about it? \n\n\nThis is the spec:\n\nScreen size\t15,1 inches\nProcessor\tIntel Core i7\nInternal RAM\t24 GB\nTotal storage capacity\t512 GB\nVideo card\tNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070\n\n\n\n",
  "It's pretty good imo, I'd probably install another m. 2 afterwards cause 512gb is just not enough nowadays.",
  "are you grateful about screen size ? it looks like small.",
  "Thank you. I would do the same. But do you think Legion is a solid choice?",
  "Yeah, legion series has gotten significantly better in the past couple of years, balancing in price, build quality and performance.",
  "Legion 5 Gen 10 vs 5i vs Alienware 16 Aurora vs 16 X Hello everyone,\n\nI'm going to study abroad soon and I need a laptop that can do it all. I made a pre-selection which seemed interesting in terms of quality and price but I will need advice to be able to decide because it is the first PC at this price and with gaming characteristics that I am going to buy. \n\nSo here are the characteristics of the 4 computers that I selected: \n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 (15' AMD)\n-AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 (or the 260?)\n-ram 32go ddr5 600MT/s (2x16go)\n-1TB ssd m.2 2242PCIe Gen 4 TLC\n-15.1’ (2560x1600) OLED screen, 500nits, 165Hz\n-nvidia 5060 8gb \n-80Wh battery\n\nPrice: between 1480 and 1520 (varies depending on the processor)\n\n-Legion 5i Gen 10 (15’ Intel)\n-Intel Core I7 14700HX 14th Gen \nSame specifications as the one above\n\nPrice: 1490\n\n-Alienware 16: \n-I7 240H series 2\n-Nvidia 5060 8gb\n-32gb of ddr5 memory (2x16gb)\n-ssd 1to\n-touchpad\n-16’ screen 2560x1600, 120hz, 300cd\n-60Wh battery\n\nPrice: 1199 instead of 1499\n\n-Alienware 16X\n-Intel Ultra 7 255HX\n-16GB of memory 2x8GB\n-240Hz screen\n-96Wh battery \n-the rest similar to the one above \n\nPrice: 1449 instead of 1699\n\n\nMy priority is that the computer can: \n\nHold a day of classes without playing video games.\nA screen with perfect quality.\nBeing able to support any video game.\nBe as quiet as possible (except when playing video games where I expect noise).\n\nFrom what I have read, the problem with the Legion equipped with the i7 is that it consumes a lot of energy even when you are not playing video games because it is not optimized to be on a laptop (I saw between 3 and 5 hours of autonomy). Conversely, the AMD Ryzen 7 allows you to last 10 hours for office activities but is 30% less efficient on demanding video games. \nAt this point should I invest in an RTX 5070 with the AMD Ryzen 7? \n\nFor the Alienware I saw a lot of criticism that it wasn't a real Alienware but a rebadged Dell, then I didn't see any test on the durability of the battery and for video games I also saw several reviews about it.\n\nWhat do you think? \n\nAnd if you have other computers I can advise you!",
  "Ideapad pro 5 vs legion 5 Hi, I am thinking about buying a new laptop for collage and I can't decide which to get. I have been looking at reviews online and so far im interested in ideapad pro 5 gen 10 (ryzen ai 7 350 and rtx 5050) and legion 5 gen 10 (didn't decide on cpu yet and rtx 5060). I care about battery life and fan noise because I spend quite some time in the library. Im also gonna be doing some CAD work for collage and playing some games like minecraft and rocket league (no AAA games) in my free time. Im also open to other suggestions. Thank you :)",
  "Lenovo legion 5 I want to buy lenovo legion 5 2025 ( Ryzen™ 7 8745H, RTX4060 8GB, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 15.6″ FHD 144Hz, W11 ). \nAfter thinking so much I decided to buy this laptop for my studies and gaming in free time. Anyone who used this whats your review? What’s the pros and cons. Should I buy it or go for another laptop. Any suggestions are accepted. Thank you.",
  "Legions generally are pretty decent machines. I've got a 5 Pro from 2021 and it has held up perfectly. \nOnly downside on the newer models is the non replacable keyboard, as it is plastic welded into the palmrest.",

  "Upgrade, or try to fix and/or live with it? [Legion Pro 5 16ARX8] Hey there! I bought a Legion Pro 5 16ARX8 (82WM0006US) just over two years ago. It's been great, but recently it's starting to accumulate some wear/issues and I'm wondering if 1) it's new enough that I should get it fixed and live with whatever can't be repaired, or 2) upgrade to something new?\n\nCurrent issues: \n\n- The screen got damaged when I had the laptop in a checked bag while traveling, wherein there's a faint thin line midway up the screen, which is functional for some colors but shows as a faint blue line for others. I've gotten estimates for repairs, which are always in the $400-500 range. But currently it's fine enough that I can live with it, it'd just be a nice plus to have it fixed.\n- It's been overheating badly lately, and some components haven't been working well. I cleaned out the fans to some improvement, but since the overheating issues, my keyboard sometimes stops working intermittently (usually fixed with a restart).\n- The trackpad mouse has been acting up, but it's probably because I badly reconnected the ZIF connector when cleaning out the internals, and could probably fix this.\n\n\nCurrent specs:\n\n- AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX\n- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070\n- 32GB DDR5\n- 1TB SSD\n- 2 TB SSD\n\nI've been thinking of upgrading to a newer Legion 5 Pro (maybe the new [Gen 10](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-pro-series/legion-pro-5-gen-10-16-inch-amd/83ltcto1wwus1)?) or an Asus ROG Zephyrus, either the [G16](https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/asus/rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gu605) or maybe something more compact for traveling like the [G14](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-3k-oled-120hz-gaming-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-1tb-platinum-white/6613954.p?skuId=6613954&sb_share_source=PDP). Open to other ideas! But the hitch is whether it's worth the $2-3k after just 2 years with the current one...\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading, grateful for any input!",
  "Which Laptop Should I Pick? Lenovo Legion Slim 5 OR HP Zbook Firefly G11 I'm a mechanical engineering student looking for a 14inch laptop for college for around 1000$. my two picks right now are either the HP Zbook Firefly g11 or the Lenovo Legion Slim 5. The legion is a refurbished laptop off of lenovo outlet.\n\nI'm concerned about the firefly because there are very mixed reviews, and some say it has good battery life and performance, others dont. I'd be getting the version with the intel ultra 5-135H and dedicated nvidia A500 GPU. I want this to be enough to do some light gaming and use CAD and simulation software for engineering. I like this laptop because it is very slim and professional. I just hope the battery life is good. \n\nOn the other hand, I love everything about the legion's performance and battery life (it has an AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS Processor and a nvidia 4060), but i am only slightly concerned about it being refurbished, and I also don't want it to stick out as a \"gaming\" laptop. It seems pretty slim but I cant tell how it will look in person. Any suggestions?",
  "The Legion Slim 5, hands down. I actually bought a refurbished one from this eBay seller: https://ebay.us/Jpwgit and it’s been good, no issues so far. The performance is amazing for the price, especially for CAD and light gaming. It doesn’t look too gamer-y either, just a bit thicker than ultrabooks but still clean-looking. #ad",
  "I also looked at the ACER Swift x 14, but i dont like that it has horrible fan noise",
  "Big difference in graphic card performance in favor of the legion slim. H series draw more power than HS processors so battery life will be affected. Look up the TDP of both processors to check. Gaming laptop stigma isnt really a thing in undergrad unless it is loud/has obnoxious lighting. People will respect it if you are an engineering student with a gaming laptop vs a history major with a gaming laptop. Rgb could make you popular at parties in the dark though.",
  "Manufacturer wise, Lenovo is hands down better than HP",
  "TDP stands for **thermal design power**, and for the Zbook it is only 57W",
  "Strix g16 vs Strix g17vs Aorus 17 vs Legion 5 vs Predator Helios neo 16! Help me Strix vs Legion vs Predator vs Aorus it’s so confuse\n\nHey folks, I need some solid opinions because I’ve read tons of reviews and Reddit posts, but I’m still stuck on my decision.\n\nI’m looking for a laptop for coding, gaming (RDR2, GTA, etc.), running two monitors (34” + 27”), and handling multitasking without breaking a sweat.\n\nI had an HP Envy 16 with an i7-13700H and RTX 4060, but it was a massive letdown—that thing ran so hot I could fry an egg on it, and I wasn’t even pushing it hard.\n\nBiggest concerns:\n\t1.\tTDP limitations – Some laptops cap power so hard that an i9 + 4070 can perform worse than an i7 + 4060.\n\t2.\tUndervolting – Some machines just won’t let you tweak it, which sucks for managing temps.\n\t3.\tHeat outside gaming – I don’t want a laptop that turns into a furnace just from opening an IDE.\n\t4.\tUpgradable RAM – If it comes with 16GB, I’ll upgrade to 32GB anyway, so that’s not a dealbreaker.\n\t5.\tBudget – Within the models available in Brazil, 4080 laptops are out of the question prices are ridiculous.\n\nModels I’m considering:\n\n\n\n\t•\tGigabyte Aorus 17 BSG-13US654SH (Ultra 7 155H + RTX 4070)\n\nHeard Aorus has great TDP tuning, meaning even an Ultra 7 could outperform a power-limited i9. Anyone confirm? I couldn’t find any real info on this model on YouTube.\n\n\n\t•\tROG Strix G16 G614JIR-N3054W (i9-14900HX + RTX 4070)\n\nPeople say it has solid cooling and good power control, but Intel chips always run hot.\n\n\n\t•\tROG Strix G17 G713PV-WS94 (Ryzen 9 7845HX + RTX 4060)\n\nRyzen generally handles TDP better, so even with a 4060, I’ve heard this can match or outperform the G16 above, just with cooler temps.\n\n\n\t•\tAcer Predator Helios Neo PHN16-72-91P6 (i9-14900HX + RTX 4070)\n\nSupposedly good cooling, but Acer’s software limits tweaking a lot. If you get unlucky with a hot unit, you’re screwed because undervolting isn’t an option.\n\n\n\t•\tLenovo Legion 5 (i9-14900HX + RTX 4060)\n\nThe Legion 7 gets a lot of praise, but I’m unsure if the Legion 5 has the same cooling and build quality.\n\n\n\t•\tLenovo Legion 5i (i9-14900HX + RTX 4060)\n\nWhat’s the actual difference between the 5 and 5i? Specs look identical to me.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anyone has experience with these, drop some knowledge! I need a laptop that handles multitasking well, runs cool, and gives me the flexibility to tweak TDP and undervolt if needed.",
  "Is this repair guy lying to me? (Lenovo Legion 5 not able to charge, says he needs to replace the entire board) Sorry for the long post I just feel like I need to write this all down for my sanity.\n\nI'm a computer science major in university so I use my laptop (Lenovo Legion 5, I7 core, NVdia Geforce GTX, \\~4 yrs old) a ton as I don't have a desktop. A few days ago I worked on my laptop earlier in the morning, then later in the day plugged it in and it wasn't able to turn on at all. I let it sit for a few hours and then I was able to turn it on but it stopped being able to charge. Figured it was a problem with the charging port since I tried with another charger and it wouldn't work, was planning on fixing it myself until I saw that you needed to solder off the charging port to replace it and decided it was too risky/high effort to do myself.\n\nTook it to a local mom and pop place with high reviews (4.9 stars on Google with 121 reviews). They seemed relatively trustworthy, said they had an open shop policy so let us look over their shoulder when they first opened the laptop up, didn't have us sign anything suspicious, was clearly a family running the store together (and had a cute dog which may/may not have swayed my opinion a lot).\n\nThey opened it up but didn't seem too clear on what was wrong with it and says that they'll need to take it all apart to figure out the issue, mentioned that a lot of the screws came loose from me using it so much, that there was a lot of lint/dust in the fans and that they were surprised something didn't go wrong with it earlier and held the open laptop to show us. This kind of matched up since the laptop has gone through a lot (one time the keyboard stopped working, it has a crack in the plastic part, occasionally gets the blue screen of death after I took a coding class that messes with the memory a lot), so I figured it was just worse off than I thought. Gave a final estimate of the repair being 50-289$ and 2-3 days to complete, and I paid 50$ down for the inspection of the issue that counts towards the total cost of the repair.\n\nA full day passes and so I call the place asking for an update. The dad of the shop says that he was working all morning on my laptop. Says he needs to replace the entire board and has been looking online for one. Says that he found that a screw came loose and grounded somewhere on the board and basically blew some stuff up. Specifically listed that a capacitor, the mother board, and the input charger was shot though seemed to vaguely imply there were other parts affected. Says he has taken pictures of all of it for me. Then he says he'll call back with the price the board would be so that I could decide if it was worth paying much more for it.\n\nCalls back in a couple of minutes and says that the part is only available in China and will be 599.99$ to replace. I ask if the repair will end up costing more than 599.99$ due to labor costs and he very adamantly says that he does flat pricing and that it will only be 599.99$. I say that I want to take it somewhere else to get a second opinion. At first he says that \"oh but this is board problem and I'm the only person in town who is able to do that\" and trails off before adding that he has already replaced the mousepad (apparently was burned all the way through) and one of the capacitor and trails off again, that the laptop is all opened up and he would need to put everything back together for someone else to look at. I eventually say that I am going to come 2 days later (since I am busy tomorrow and the day after) to look at it in person, see his pictures and then decide if I want to get a second opinion.\n\nHonestly I was just lying and I think no matter what I am taking it to get a second opinion. But I'm worried still mostly because I feel like the scenarios are:\n\n* They're well-meaning but confused, laptop can actually be fixed at much lower price somewhere else (best case)\n* They're lying about the state of the laptop to get more money -- it can be repaired at a much lower price somewhere else and they let me do that (basically same as best case but makes me feel worse)\n* They're right and the laptop does need its board entirely replaced for high price\n* They're lying about the state of the laptop and now since I've pressed to see it in person and view the pictures, they're going to deliberately damage it to corroborate their story (worst case)\n\nAnd I'm very worried that it'll be the latter story. This is especially because I didn't take pictures of the interior of the laptop beforehand.\n\nIn general though I feel like it's very suspicious. The kind of damage that messes up the whole board I feel like should have been much more noticeable and I'm honestly not even sure how a screw could have come loose and damaged the board like that. I also just find it weird because the laptop was perfectly functional -- just not able to charge but the damage he is describing seems like it would also affect the laptop's function aside from the charging. Out of the very few bad reviews one person had a very similar story about having to get a part from China and it being very expensive which is boggling my mind now (attached image below). I'm not even sure if I can get my 50$ back which really bothers me. But then again if they do genuinely need the part I feel like it would be that price in which case is this even a bad deal?\n\nI'm just feeling duped right now and need a sanity check / some advice on how to proceed :(\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1vi93uwz4dzd1.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=96bb4bfb8cfeee35f4042c18fbf65a1f6dea65c7\n\n",
  "Doesn't really matter if htey're lying or not.  $600 to repair a 4 year old laptop is ALMOST never worth it.  AT BEST, that's like $100 less than the laptop is still worth.  At worst, it's worth maybe 1/2 that.  Just say the parts too expensive and you want your laptop back.\n\nThe $50 deposit is generally considered non-refundable as that's the \"if we take the time to open it up and see what's wrong, this is the labor fee for doing that\".  This is pretty industry standard practice, and you'll find it at just about anyplace that does repairs where they need to do troubleshooting.\n\nGet the laptop back, write off the $50 as what it cost to find out, and get something else.",
  "I had a very similar experience with my Lenovo ThinkPad E14 here in India. Fortunately, the local service centre I went to were honest enough to accept that they can not repair the board. They tried changing the Power IC in the charging circuit and failed twice. The laptop wouldn't turn on even after repeated attempts. After 5 days, they finally returned the laptop without even charging a service fee. I took the laptop to a more experienced local service centre (guy with more than 35 yrs in the business, he also services all the laptops of an IT organization run by my dad's close friend), and explained everything in detail. He said he'll try to do his best to repair it but after 2 days of toiling, even he couldn't fix it. Changing the Power IC continued to short the motherboard resulting in the power not being delivered to the main processor. He was somehow able to get it to turn on though. He suggested I change the motherboard and quoted a decent price for it. Since the laptop was just one year old, and the motherboard costed 1/3rd the cost of the laptop, I decided to go for it instead of buying a new laptop. \n\nIn your case, I would strongly suggest you to be firm on taking it elsewhere for a second opinion. And if it still costs $600 to repair, you would definitely be better off buying a new laptop by pooling in $200-300 extra especially during the upcoming sales in the US.\n\nMore details on the problem I faced with my laptop here - https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/s/v49ca28ilk",

  "ASUS TUF A15, Lenovo LOQ 15 or Lenovo Legion Slim 5 with slightly lower specs? I’m an architecture student, I want a budget-friendly gaming laptop that is strong for renders and 3D softwares, also I don’t own a PS5 or a next-gen gaming console, which might be the case for a long while, so I want a laptop that also performs well in games. I currently have 3 options that I cannot decide between:\n\n1-ASUS TUF A15 Ryzen 7 7735hs RTX 4060 8gb VRAM 1080p 144hz\n\n2-Lenovo LOQ 15 intel i7 13620h RTX 4060 8gb 1080p 144hz\n\n3-Lenovo Legion Slim 5 intel i7 13700h RTX 4050 6gb VRAM 2K display 165hz\n\nThe ASUS is the cheapest, with both the LOQ and the Legion being equally priced. I went to a store and asked one of the workers there about the ASUS and told me so many good stuff about it compared to the LOQ, such as the cooling system and build quality, but watching reviews on this model of ASUS, all comments on it are kinda mixed which makes me scared of getting it, I’m more convinced about getting the LOQ because I heard it has a better display which is something that strongly matters to me. \n\nAs for the Legion, I heard that it’s the BEST budget gaming laptop there is, though considering that it’s gpu is 4050 instead of 4060, it makes me scared of regretting my purchase, since 4060 is significantly better than the 4050.\n\nSorry for all of this text, but I would love some advice, if it is based on personal experience that would be a lot better, but all suggestions are welcome, thanks! :))\n\n",
  "I'd do the LOQ or the Legion in your scenario. I know they're promising to be better but the ASUS support stories still scare the shit out of me. I really wouldn't trust in-store workers on anything, they're just trying to sell you stuff. \n\nMeanwhile I've used Lenovo support multiple times for repairs and full part replacements without problems. The 4060 will be way, way better than the 4050, so the LOQ is the best bang for your buck. I have an LOQ with a 7840HS and a mobile 4060 and it's basically my workstation now as well - it plays all games at high/ultra and doesn't have any problems. Had this for almost a year now with no problems.",
  "Thank you for the suggestion! I’ve been thinking about getting the LOQ too, but I haven’t heard great stuff about the thermals and the build quality. Does the build quality feel cheap? Or is it durable enough? And is the cooling good when playing games?",
  "Seeking Advice on Legion Pro 5 16\" for After Effects and gaming  Hi everyone,\n\nI'm currently in the market for a new laptop and, after some research, my attention was captured by the Legion Pro 5 16\" model, the version with the Ryzen 7 processor, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, and an RTX 4070 GPU. From what I've read, it seems to receive good reviews for its performance and price (1699 EUR). My primary use case would be running After Effects very smoothly without a long rendering process and I'd like to indulge in some gaming. I'm not into the latest, most demanding titles, but I do enjoy a wide range of games that aren't too graphically intensive.  Anyway, I'm a bit out of my depth with laptop specs so if there are alternative laptops you think could be better, I'm all ears. ",
  "Legion Slim 5 or Dell G15 Hello, I'm about to purchase one of these 2 laptops but I'm having a hard time deciding. Here are the specs of both:  \n\n\nLegion Slim 5: R5 7640HS, RTX 4060, 16GB DDR5, 512GB SSD for $900  \nDell G15: R7 7840HS,RTX 4060, 16GB DDR5, 512GB SSD for $950  \n\n\nBasically the difference is the processor. I'm aware that the Dell is bulky and has a heavy charger, but that is not a problem for me because I will use the laptop as a desktop, will be plugged 99% of the time. However, I've seen reviews mention that it has one of the best cooling systems in this price range, plus a better processor. I know the Legion has a better display, but it's not important for me either as I will connect 2 external 1080p monitors which are the main ones I use. My main use will be software development and gaming.   \n\n\nSo, excluding the weight and the display, which one would you recommend and why? ",

I doubled its supplied 16G to 32G and filled the 2nd NVME slot as well.\n\nI work in engineering simulation where its generally high capability and its GPU are important. I'm not a gamer. The only noticeable \"gamer\" aspect of it is the RGB kbd that runs color waves by default, but Fn+Space cycles through a selection, one of which is steady blue and another is just turning it off.

  "Used Lenovo legion 5 worth it? Hey guys! So I have a seller that's willing to sell their Lenovo Legion 5 for $860, and it has been used for 1.5 years.

  "Legion 5 vs Nitro 5 (2020) Tried checking ASUS TUF A15 but decide not to buy it due to thermal issues. So I am here again, by the way I am not a heavy gamer (Dota 2, LOL, DN, Minecraft are games that I would love to play) and I will use it most of the time for engineering school. \n\nWhich is the better the deal? In terms of price in my country: Legion 5 $996.34 while Nitro 5 $935.24. I used CAD (2D most of the time), Adobe premier and photoshop.\n\n\nFYI: Legion 5 is on Ryzen 5 - 4600H with 120 hertz while Nitro 5 is on Intel 5 - 10300H with 144 hertz. Error: It should be HHD and SSD. \n\n\nWhy I am considering Nitro? It’s cheaper and there might be a possible upgrade so I can maximize my budget which is $1000. \nHowever legion 5 has great reviews based from my research, like the thermals are good and lesser issues.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/i2ahye)",
  "Ryzen has proven to be better lately",
  "Go for the legion. It has a ryzen 4000. And the cooling system is better.",
  "Go with the Nitro, don't look at the numbers on the Legion.",
  "Yes it is however I don’t know if it is an overkill to buy the specs.",
  "Yeah legion is leading by landslide LOL. However, I might still consider nitro but could you give me more of your thoughts regarding this?",
  "Yeah but the difference isn't massive in my opinion if you are going to spend almost 1k already. The legion is a generally better made laptop compared to the barebone approach of the Nitro.",
  "Well, I've been a Lenovo user for 4 years now, and it is a great company, with great laptops. They have good warranty stuff, great programs that come with it, but I just never want to use a Lenovo laptop again. Acer just feels better for me, more worth the prices. But it all cimes down to personal preference.",
  "Yep. However that 45%-60% sRGB for legion 5 really turns me off. Though, the remedy for that is an extended monitor.",
  "I can't see the sRGB of the Nitro, I don't think it will be much better. Around 60% ain't bad for gaming although it doesn't look as nice for media consumption. Most high refresh rate screens are like this",
  "Yeah but I am not really mainly using it for gaming. So I don’t know if it will be good enough for video editing and stuff. But yes, legion 5 is really promising.",
  "Is that Nitro 144Hz with 100% sRGB? That sounds too good to be true if you ask me especially at that price point",
  "I have a Lenovo Legion 5 (120Hz 60% sRGB), and the screen is actually good. I've done some video editing on mine, and color correcting outside scenes wasn't a problem. My **only** complaint about it is that sitting at my desk I can see the reflection of the ceiling light a little bit more that other screens.\n\nAlso, I have no idea about the i5 10300H, but when editing videos and rendering (Even with GPU Acceleration), those Ryzen chips are amazing.",
  "Actually the regular price is almost $1k. However I can get it on that price by cash.",
  "Ohh. That’s manageable. Thanks for feedback.",
  "Still I would say to double check because that's unusual to have a 100% sRGB 144Hz on a budget device",

  "Lenovo Legion 5 Rtx 3050ti, Yellowish Color/Tint Posted on r/lenovo and r/gaminglaptops as well. \n\nI recently bought a Lenovo Legion 5 Rtx 3050ti, my first upgrade in 4 years. Everything is working fine, but the screen is yellowish, at least, for me. I've gone through almost every standard solution I've seen out there. Night light, graphic drivers updates, etc. I've only been able to reduce the yellowish tint down to a somewhat tolerable level through turning up the Kelvin temperature in AMD Radeon Software to 10000, and some weird nit-pits here and there with color calibration. Even then, it is still annoying, if not agonizing to me.\n\nThe standard Kelvin temperature is 6500k apparently, which is supposed to look like a natural white. It looks weird and yellow to me. Apparently it might be because my old laptop that I've been using is 'too blue' or has never been calibrated, so my eyes aren't used to it. I've given it the benefit of the doubt on that part, but it just seems too yellow for me. I can tell the screen is a bit too yellowish or weird, because the standard windows blue screen that appears when shutting down, restarting, etc, has a tealish tint to it instead of the standard blue(this is at its base form, 6500k, no color calibration).\n\nI've looked online at other videos where they showcase/review the Lenovo Legion 5 with the RTX 3050ti, and their screens seem normal to me.\n\nI wanted to know if there was something I could do to possibly fix this, something I haven't tried yet. I've preferabbly not want to return the laptop, because that will just be annoyance, and I don't want to return in vain just in case there's a solution to it. \n\nIf anyone has a similar situation, solution, or advice, please respond if you can. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Display-Processor-GeForce-82JW0012US/dp/B08YKG5K7F/ref=mp_s_a_1_28?dchild=1&keywords=gaming+laptop&qid=1631584669&sr=8-28\n\nHere's a link to the laptop if it helps.\n\nEdit: Added comparisons using old wallpaper. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/BW8KTyV",

  "Lenovo legion 5 vs Dell G3 15 I am currently looking to buy a \"budget\" gaming laptop and after looking at several reviews and local prices, it resulted in a battle between these two laptops. \n\nLenovo legion 5 specs: \nPrice: € 1.149\n- 15,6 inch\n- i7-10750H (6 cores, max 5 GHz) \n- 16 GB RAM \n- 1 TB total storage ( HDD and 512GB SDD) \n- 120 Hz display screen \n- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti with 6 GB \n\nDell G3 15 specs:\nPrice: € 1,260 \n- 15,6 inch\n- i7-10750H (6 cores, max 5GHz) \n- 16 GB RAM\n- 512 GB M.2 PCle NVMe Solid State-Drive \n- 120 Hz display screen \n- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 with 6 GB\n\nI plan on using the laptop for everyday use, programming (rather intensively) and occasional gaming. Any of you guys can help me choose? I don't know if the RTX 2060 is necessary as I am not a frequent gamer, but I would like to run most games fluently if I would be playing them. I also don't know if the price difference is worth it or not. \n\nAny other laptop recommendation is definitely appreciated as well.",
  "This is not even a \"battle\". The Legion 5 will utterly destroy the G3 simply because it has better cooling. There are many more problems of the G3 and the Dell G series in general, but I'm not going to go over that now.\n\nAlso, why 1660 Ti? Get RTX 2060 if you can. In my country, upgrading the Legion 5 to the 2060 is just an extra $55.",
  "Soon-to-be CS Uni student looking for a Laptop (Eye on Acer Nitro 5 and Lenovo Legion 5) I'm going to be a uni student quite soon and I need a powerful budget laptop for my time there.\n\nThe requirements for me are 16gb of RAM, a good quality CPU that can take some intensive tasks, and probably also quite a good graphics card.\n\nI've looked at a bunch of different options and my attention has been caught by two models: Acer Nitro 5 and Lenovo Legion 5. The two I have are at exactly the same price and I would love to have some feedback on my decision because none of the reviews have the same models or seem to agree on much.\n\nThe Acer Nitro 5 has an i7 10750H processor, 6 cores, 16gb RAM, 2933 MHz speed, GTX 1660 Ti graphics cards and 6gb video ram.\n\nThe Lenovo Legion has the better Ryzen 7 4800H processor, 8 cores, 16 gb RAM at the slightly faster 3200 MHz. The graphics card is worse though, as a GTX 1650 Ti instead. The battery life is much better though.\n\nI've been reading a ton of reviews and it seems like the Acer Nitro 5 has some overheating issues, which worries me. I probably won't be playing AAA games on it but my studies sound like some taxing stuff will be coming my laptop's way, and I want it to handle that.\n\nOn the other hand, I hear the Lenovo Legion 5 lacks in sturdiness, apparently chipping easily, which also raises an eyebrow, since we're talking a machine I need to rely on for 3-5 years at least.\n\nThere are several cheaper models I could also go to, but there is the worry that they won't be strong enough, and I'd rather be a bit futureproof if I can. I've heard about other suggestions from people but most of them are just too pricey for me in my country.\n\nAre these two good options for me? Which would you folks say is the better one? Or is there a third option I'm missing out on? I do have a budget to keep within and it seems every model is more expensive here, so I don't have unlimited options.",
  "You should get the lenovo legion 5 with your eyes closing",
  "Is this laptop worth 1049.99? ",
  "I would presume so",
  "100%",
  "Yes, very reputable brand too (don't worry about the number of reviews)",
  "Yeah.  \nKnown brand with good hinges, damn beautiful, great components too.  \nIt's OLED too.  \nI'd buy it for sure.  \n\nOP, I think you're either wasting our time or wasting your money, to say so as nicely as possible.  \nThis laptop is everything you need and want at 1k$.  \nYou want RGB? FINE! Get some laptop with worse specs that's marketed \"for gaming\" and see it suck in games.  \nThis one is good for years if you do proper maintenance.(Just like any other laptop).",
  "Yes",
  "i recently bought the legion pro 5i, all those specs except less storage, no oled and it’s 16in. it has 4 zone rgb. It’s an incredible laptop. imo the legion line has the best laptops for its price, honestly i would pay more for it. i’m LOVING it, the gaming performance is impressive. i also thought it looked boring when i saw it online but in person it looks great. My screen isn’t OLED like the version you posted and i still think it’s fantastic. LOVE that most ports are at the back and not the side. just a well designed and powerful laptop, i would highly recommend.",
  "Sorry guys, its 1049.99 US dollars",
  "If it’s usd, seems like a good deal",
  "Yeah that's pretty good.",
  "It's decent, do some looking around to compare price to other websites",
  "Probably would need to upgrade the RAM tho",
  "No",
  "my laptop had a 3060, same cpu and bettet screen and cost 500 more",
  "Specs like this are worth double that in most places of the world so if you question is is it worth buying, then the answer is yes",
  "Looks a decent laptop at that price. Go ahead and buy it if you like it. Number of reviews don't really mean anything. If you're still on the fence, just look it up on YouTube",
  "Do you guys know when is the best time for a laptop discount? Are there specific day for discount?",
  "yolo",
  "Decent",
  "My friend just bought this, definitely worth the money + the screen is beautiful",
  "1049.99 of what currency?",
  "Kinda meh, you can get basically the same thing for 800 usually if you look for a good deal",
  "I have a 17” legion with a 3060. Things been great to me for the last few years!",
  "The screen and the specs look good. I would try the touchpad and decide. \n\nCheap plastic touchpads are a NO GO on expensive laptops. Or the other way around: I don’t understand why the majority Windows machines continue to try to copy Apple with cheap plastic touchpads and still put outrageous price tags.",
  "I have that laptop, it's worth it and i bought it for $1250",
  " Go for it !! Or zephyrus g14 is also the option !! It has offers going on time to time on bestbuy",
  "yeah its good for the price",
  "My dad got a laptop with worst specs for 1500 :(",
  "Here is your stupid question of the day: If a laptop is excellent at gaming can I assume it is excellent at non gaming, just business stuff? Or is a gaming laptop just built for gaming and actually doesn't handle Excel and Teams very well?",
  "Its ok",
  "Going off of what I know with the legion brand, I would only say it depends if it's a metal casing or plastic casing.\n\nPlastic casing from my experience just feels cheaper and easier to break. The metal will give a premium feel.",
  "This is in all possibility, really really good. I remember paying similar amount for i7 8th gen 8GB RAM, 128 GB SSD, 1 TB HDD, 4GB 1080 Ti. This was in 2019 though.",
  "yes ofc",
  "hell yeah. I bought a laptop with an i7-10750H and 3060 6gb in 2021 for like 1800$. I'd be more than happy to upgrade to that(ofc I won't cuz I don't have 1050$)",
  "Good deal!!",
  "It is but I’d still always recommend buying with a warranty. And having it shipped to a local store before picking it up. Like ordering from Best Buy then having them do the set up. (They will catch any problems before you bring it home).",
  "100%",
  "Godlike CPU\n\nMeh GPU\n\nEntry level RAM capacity\n\n🤡 🤡 🤡 🤡 🤡",
  "Lots of people answering that it's worth it but none of them have a clue which CURRENCY you use in your country... this might be Roubles or Yen or Hong Kong Dollars for all we know.",

  "Do you have any other laptop suggestions? This one only have 100ish people reviews, i am kind scared",
  "second this",
  "This one doesnt look that cool, no rgb light and that kinda stuff, do you know any laptop thats cool , same quality (a bit more expensive is acceptable)",
  "Thank you and sorry man, i got scammed multiple times, spending lots of money to get something really bad, i dont want to experience this again, mb",
  "Do you have any other laptop suggestions? This one only have 100ish people reviews, i am kind scared",
  "Can you send the link",
  "Sorry, but what is usd",
  "It’s not when it was 799 before",
  "Do you know any fancy one? This one have no rgb and cool stuff",
  "Sadly, the RAM is soldered in. But you can buy a 32GB ram model from Lenovo's website directly. Unfortunately, its $1620 right now for 32GB ram + 1TB SSD.  I don't how often Lenovo does sales but I managed to nab the 32GB RAM 1TB model for under $1300",
  "You can't, it's soldered to the board.\n\nOnly problem with these slim laptops.",
  "16GB is good enough",
  "Can i ask why",
  "Can you send me a link to the laptop",
  "[deleted]",
  "Alr bro, everyone is saying this laptop worth it, im getting it:))",
  "Thank you bro, everyone is saying its pretty good, im getting it:)",
  "USD",
  "No you can't.. Not with an oled and a 4060. This screen is downright beautiful and worth a little extra.",
  "Gaming laptop means good specs that can handle everything, it can handle both business and gaming",
  "[removed]",
  "Us dollars",
  "Dollars",
  "wtf",
  "Bro what? 😂 Idk if there are any mainstream laptop rtx 3050 mods that doubles its vram. I’m sure Lenovo doesn’t do it.",
  "100 reviews is more than enough for a laptop",
  "It only recently began being sold, so it's normal that there aren't 1000+ reviews on the product.  Lenovo make some of the best gaming laptops, I'm sure this one would perform just fine.",
  "I think it should be great",
  "It's a Lenovo, you're good.  Just don't get a HP or MSI.",
  "For gaming zephyrus g14",
  "you can get the zephyrus g14 but i would honestly opt for this one, lenovo legion has a good reputation. The price is okay too",
  "You have wrong prorities my friend, rgb isn't important, it's the parts inside that are, like what cpu, GPU and ram and stuff, but it's your money so you do you.",
  "Check out dave2d youtube channel, most of his reviews are gaming laptops of all price ranges. You are best off shopping for slightly older models on big discounts from retailers like bestbuy, they always have good devices on sale",
  "I meaannnn literally anything other than razer blade has shitty rgb no?",
  "There is Asus tuf series but lenevo has better build quality and temps so just go with the lenevo",
  "I understand, but if you want RGB you'll likely get scammed. You'll get scammed by thinking it's still worth the price, when this one is worth 1k$, it's the definition of a 1k$ laptop if you ask me.  \nBest damn thing at this price.  \nNow, with this specs, I must ask, are you looking for a gaming LAPTOP, or a PC?  \nThe laptop is underpowered compared to the PC because of the thermals and battery, but the PC lacks much of the portability.  \nGet a laptop if you need it to be portable, not if it's like the 5th criteria on your list.",
  "I own this laptop . Overall, it's great that even Youtuber Jared's Tech also named it the best 14-inch gaming laptop of 2023 . The display is beautiful, the performance is great, and the downside is soldered ram and mediocre speakers\n\nThe other option i considered was the G14 2023 with 4060 and the G16 2023 4060 they were around 1100 ish after taxes",
  "as the guy said the one you posted is better than mine! once you don’t mind a smaller screen and no rgb like mine, get it.",
  "Get the one you posted it's way better.",
  "US Dollars",
  "Wait a minute, it was 799 before?",
  "I've never seen this one 799. I think you're talking about a different model.",
  "its ur money so its ur choice 100% but if youre going for a laptop I think rgb should be last of ur worries.",
  "You'd probably have to either pay more or start compromising on actual specs.",
  "Ah right, I forgot that this is the slim version. My bad.",
  "the 16” version is not soldered",
  "For a short while, yes. Not in the long run though.",
  "not sure if its on sale anymore. ill check anyway and find out",
  "ROG STRIX SCAR G15 Electro Punk",
  "wow! thanks for pointing that out! i really didnt know! 🤩🤩",
  "Also you'll love the oled screen",
  "I've seen OLED g14 go to 800, as well as gigabyte aero OLED go to like 900. Both with 4060",
  "Are you saying that business applications will use more battery than gaming ?",
  "WHICH COUNTRY?! Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, USA, and numerous other countries use Dollars, ALL with different values...",
  "Why is that, made me curious",
  "I have a laptop with a 3050ti with 12 gigs of vram",
  "You convinced me, and do you think this is worth it? I play lots of games though, including 3A.",
  "Also, do you guys know if theres like a day for laptop discount or something like that, ehen is the best time to buy laptop",
  "This one only have less than 200 reviews, im kind concerning",
  "Some Lenovo has nice red lighting with a custom bios that makes rgb available on all keys.",
  "[removed]",
  "US dollars, my bad",
  "Most people will assume US dollars when you say dollars especially since a majority of redditors are based in the US.  No need to be so aggressive damn",
  "I have no idea what that person is talking about. Also yes the Slim 14inch is a steal at that price.",
  "It is a good purchase. Buy it.",
  "3050 is not even comparable to a 4060.. he's just saying nonsense.",
  "a 3050 is not good compared to a 4060",
  "Honestly, I think it could handle everything, maybe not at MAX settings, but at good ones and also reviews don't always mean anything, just because something doesn't have a ton of reviews doesn't mean it sucks,just means not that many like to write reviews or that many people haven't found this laptop yet and people also buy such laptops on other sites as well.",
  "considering laptops often get like 20 reviews, its fine",
  "Gotcha.",
  "OK thank you. Have a good day.",
  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

  "Asus tuf",
  "Think it's better to go with the Asus one because the GPU isn't all that powerful.  \nHonestly the RAM is one of the best indicators for a worthy upgrade in my opinion. It's been over a decade for laptops to have 16GB of memory RAM, so there isn't much to upgrade and it just becomes spending for almost the same experience.\n\nThe increased resolution with the same GPU also means the overall strain on the GPU will be higher, since it's also a larger monitor.\n\n\"Gaming\" Starts with 70ti series and above for laptops, but it also depends how and what games you want to play.",
  "is that Intel part of the ones with degradation issues?",
  "Its weird. The Legion beats the Tuf on a whole host of stuff, performance-wise. And overall build-quality.\n\nBut where the Tuf beats the Legion is where I actually care the most and it beats it quite handy.\n\nI said I leaned more towards the Tuf. I might have already changed my stance on the two as I have before, multiple times 😄\n\nThe comparison\nhttps://www.notebookcheck.net/index.php?id=127065&specs[]=347144&specs[]=343595",
  "Lenovo all the way. I bought the exact laptop few weeks ago. Best decision ever, especially compared to everything else I’ve owned before. I paid 900€, so you might wait for November to get a good deal.",
  "I own that same lenovo legion with the exact same specs. I'd 100% recommend it. Its the best laptop I've ever used to this day, and the screen is just amazing. Games run smoothly and the temperatures run cold 👌",
  "Any detail on screen srgb? If you use laptop screen a lot and don't hook it up to external moniyor, it might be worth considering the srgb difference.",
  "Legion is the better laptop but the TUF is a far better deal €400 difference for me is what counts:performance should be similar in gaming but not software(intel is faster) but the ryzen is efficient,cooler and more stable(look up raptor lake issues).Go with the better deal.EDIT:I saw in the original post that they were the same price but that TUF came with the 4070 instead of the 4060;in which case my opinion still stands,this just means the TUF is cheaper.Also while the i7 is faster:it may be more issue prone and is certainly less efficient but buy what you prefer-Legion has better reputation,TUF is specced better.",
  "Listen fellow crypto trader ( nice username) any chance you’re in the U.S.? I’ll get you a phenomenal deal on the legion 7. If you’re Interested I can get you specs.",
  "Just based on the specs and price, I'd go for the Asus, that 400€ gives me a ton of extra upgrades for that thing! I'd slap some 64gb of memory in it, some extra storage and a decent backpack.",
  "I am using tuf it performs pretty good if u are looking to play games like league,valorant etc..,\nit will heat up but everything else works fine",
  "The Legion is not worth an extra €400.\n\nThe Legion is a nicer laptop overall. CPU performance is better, specifically multicore performance. Single core should only be slightly better. Display is better. Build quality is slightly better.\n\nThe biggest area where the TUF does beter in is, as you identified, battery life. Build quality is still decent, and the 8945HS is still a high end CPU. The HS CPUs are for more of a balance between battery life and performance, whilst the HX CPUs are for those who just want CPU performance and don't care for battery life. \n\nThe TUF has a better GPU, which is preferable for most games. CIV5 like games that you play are more CPU intensive though, so the Legion may still perform a bit better here.\n\nIn terms of noise, as long as you aren't doing anything too demanding, neither laptop should be a problem. If you're pushing the hardware to its limit whilst you work then expect both to sound like a jet engine.\n\nI'd get the TUF. Better value, better battery life and better GPU. CPU performance is still good even if it isn't as good as the 14650HX.",
  "Definitely the ASUS TUF.",
  "I would like to know more about this display on TUF. I don’t know why people ignore it here in the comments, but I am pretty sure legion has a superior display all the way. Just make sure that you won’t end up with a “meh” display with max 250 nits.",

  "Yep! I figured I might, for both options, upgrade to 32gb of RAM which, with both options, is easy to do!\n\nWhat you state is also very interesting and hits one of my issues/points of thought.\nIs thr 4070 THAT more 'fututeproof' than the 4060? Because of the VRAM indeed.\n\nLooking into it further Ive seen that the Legion is, in its pricerange, basically the best 4060 laptop.\nBut does that matter with the years? Will the 4060 become useless pretty fast? In your opinion the answer would be a yes?",

  "Thanks for all the comments and advicementaries friends.\n\nI just decided something though\nSomeone mentioned I should wait for black friday\nI didnt want to\nBut I checked the deals they throw here, even in the Netherlands\n\nAnd man.\nYeah its worth to wait. I'd be a thief of me own money if I wouldnt",
  "I was considering waiting on black friday but Im not sure I can. I actually do need a new laptop and 1300 is still a decent reduction of what it normally sells here.\n\nI asked someone else as well, someone also very positive about the Legion;\n\nHow does it do in everyday, not-plugged in life? Size, noise, battery etc.? It will be performing a whole lot of mobile non-gaming tasks. Thanks thanks",
  "Hmmmmm. My biggest regret with buying the Tuf would have been missing out on the screen the Legion has. Among many other things.\n\nIf you use it for everyday tasks, college-like stuff, does it perform well? Not to clunky, not to loud, not to quick to empty? Because thats where the Tuf is REALLY good. Can you, for instance, just let it run on the processor and its internal graphics fine? \nThanks bud",
  "I do not know what screen srbg means exactly hehe.\n\nThis I've found for the Lenovo:\n100% sRGB (Argyll 2.2.0 3D)\n\nThis for the TUF:\n98.5% sRGB (Argyll 2.2.0 3D)\n\nI have considered this, yeah. With the screen of the Tuf being shit, an external monitor comes to mind. I actually read that it has 2 ports to connect to am external screen with. One will always use the AMD Radeon 780M iGPU of the Ryzen 9 and one will always use the RTX 4070. Which sounds pretty dope.\n\nIm going to look up what srgb is now",
  "The deals in the picture arent what I have!\n\nTheeee Tuf and the Legion are both €1300 at the moment and although the Legion is exactly as in the picture, the Tuf actually has a rtx4070 in it.\n\nI just learned about the Raptor lake stuff.\nThe Tuf has become really interesting. \nThe biggest drawback is still the screen it has.\nAs Im not really good at this... how do I found out how the Tuf performs with an external monitor?",
  "Haha thanks my friend but Im not! The Netherlands it is\n\nNicer username!",
  "Btw. The price is actually the same for both in my case.\nThe deals Im looking at have both these laptops, with the TUF having a rtx 4070, at €1300. Talking the Netherlands, stuff isnt comparable to the US or even Germany.\n\nIve said in this thread to wait for black friday but Im actually not so sure. The ASUS-store has this laptop at €1899 normally. They have a flash-sale where its €1599... and I can get it for €1299 + possible tax reductions via my job.\n\nThis is, objectively, price included, a very good laptop right? You'd know! Thanks",
  "Very succint reply friend, thanks. I actually learned a lot in this entire thread. Knowledge I will build on the coming month so I can make a good decision when black friday comes around, lol. Thanks again",
  "Very good point and it is something I have very much considered in everything. Also mentioned in the text. It would be the single biggest thing I miss out on.\nThe screen of the TUF is kinda meh with 300 nits.\n\nBut, and maybe you know how to find this;\nWhat specs determine how good a laptop runs with an external screen? Because that would kinda fix that whole issue.\n\nThe Tuf is really, really good on the go in comparison to the Legion. If it works well with a monitor at home its to me the Tuf that takes it",

  "There is no futureproof really with laptops, they aren't as big to have drastic performance differences compared to desktop pc.\n\nNo pc even laptops are ever becoming useless, if you want to play new AAA games then you have to spend a lot, there is no other way around it unfortunately.\n\nThe way you have to think about it is, check the benchmarks of the games you want to play currently, and see if they match the performance the GPU can produce to have a decent experience.  \nLike for example I got a Lenovo Y500 (I think, it's been almost a decade) And I see it like a xbox360 console with a set of specific games I can play and run properly.\n\nAs for new AAA games, well... I got a desktop pc for that.  \nThe futureproof exists in the desktop pcs, not in laptops.\n\nThe 4070ti vs the 4060 (Non ti) oh wait, there is no TI version for the laptops lol.

  "Right! Because with my just amassed knowledge that just sounds really strong. And its like a 30% sale already\n\nOne question to put this to bed really;\nAre there specs to know how a laptop handles an external monitor? Because if the TUF does that well a VERY big argument against the Tuf and in favour of the Legion would be gone.\n\nIts just so much better on the road. If it can be used semi like a desktop at home for serious gaming... it really wins to me. And Imma buy it.",

  "Be careful with Lenovo though. I have one and they cut some pretty weird corners to make it cheaper (cooling solutions, storage limitations, power delivery, the included charger not having enough wattage and it losing charge gaming while plugged in). A friend of mine has another similar model which fucked up one of the stock RAM sticks, and only one slot works since putting a stick on the other makes the system bluescreen randomly.

Traditionally i9 draws way more power and heats up a lot in laptops. Even when u play simple games like valorant that rely heavily on ur cpu but are not intensive at the same time, it reaches 80-85c when an i7 gets u almost same fps (a differece of 10-15 in AAA titles) but doesnt heat up as much. You can work with it and type, and also do vid editing. Unless you are into layering a lot of scenes or textures simultaneously (usually happens in professional vid editinf) you dont require i9. If its just for writing and vid editing i9 is an overkill. \n\nSo just check a vid that features legion's thermals and if u r fine with it buy the i9 one, if not try getting the i7 one",

  "Review and recomemdation help I will be starting my college and am buying a laptop in few days after a wile of research I have stumbled upon my best choice yet and I would like all yours review on it \nI will also be adding 1 tb ssd with thermal pading to it's second slot \nI do not have any problems with its battery life and just want a future proof laptop for ai and mltprojects as well \nDon't plan on it but may be a little gamig also\n",
  "Price?",
  "Approx 1.2 or 1.3 for everything including the update",
  "I've seen cheaper with rtx 5050 (basically rtx 4060) with similar cpu and a 1tb ssd for cheaper. \n\nIt's not a legion but it is from lenovo",
  "Which one is it",
  "Lenovo loq 10th. The ones that just came out. Seen some on amazon ect. I dunno if they have up the price since then though.",
  "Bro they have a motherboard issue , most of these and the screen and cooling is not as good",
  "It uses a 13th gen cpu, so does loqs. How do you know this won't have the same issue? \n\nAlso its a newer version that released very recently so they maybe a better chance of no mobo issues. \n\nThough, its entirely up to you dude.",
  "I will check it with ai , good recommendation tho bro thnx",
  "How can I manage temperatures on my Lenovo Legion 5i 16\" (Ultra 9 275HX + RTX 5060) when XTU/ThrottleStop don’t work? Hey all,\n\n**Laptop:** Lenovo Legion 5i 16\" Gaming Laptop — Model 83NX0000US \n\n**Specs:** Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX (24C), RTX 5060 8GB, 32GB DDR5-5600, 1TB SSD, 16\" 2560×1600 240Hz, Windows 11 Home, 80Wh, 245W adapter. Retail listing badge: 4.3/5 (14 reviews). Price seen: $1,499.99.\n\n**What I'm seeing**\n\nAfter about 30 minutes in PUBG, my CPU temps spike to 100–104 °C and I'm getting Thermal Throttling warnings in the sensors.\n\nGPU temps seem fine though (60–80 °C), and my Afterburner undervolt/curve appears to be working.\n\nLenovo Vantage performance profiles change things a bit, but Intel XTU power limits (PL1/PL2) just keep reverting back whenever I start gaming.\n\n**XTU messages / logs I saw (what they mean)**\n\n* **Power Throttled** → CPU is hitting PL1/PL2 (long/short turbo power limits).\n* **Current Throttled** → limited by motherboard/VRM amperage caps.\n* **Thermal Throttled** → CPU reached the temp ceiling (\\~95–105 °C), clocks dropped to cool down.\n* **Graphics Current Throttled** → iGPU hit current limit (not really critical for dGPU gaming).\n\nBasically, power, current, and thermal limits are all kicking in—pretty normal for thin laptops under heavy load.\n\n**XTU \"Import Profile\" error I got**\n\n\"This system does not support importing profiles because certain controls required to permit overclocking are inaccessible.\"\n\nFrom what I can tell, Lenovo's firmware (EC) + Intel DTT lock most tuning controls on this Meteor Lake (Core Ultra) platform. What this means:\n\n* A lot of XTU sliders show up but any changes don't stick (or get overridden when you boot/load a game).\n* Undervolting is blocked (Plundervolt mitigation) on most 2023–2025 Legions.\n* ThrottleStop shows \"CPU not supported\" on Core Ultra → basically unusable.\n\n**My test interpretation (XTU + sensors)**\n\nDuring CPU stress: CPU Utilization = 100%, Package \\~71–74 °C, Power Limit Throttling = Yes, Thermal Throttling = No (in that specific run), P-core max dropped from \\~4.59 → 4.21 GHz.\n\nIn actual games (PUBG): later sessions definitely hit 100 °C+ and showed Thermal Throttling events.\n\nSo Lenovo's firmware is actively enforcing these safety caps (power/current/thermal)—the system's not \"broken,\" it's just designed this way.\n\n**What I've tried / current workarounds**\n\n* **Intel XTU:** Setting PL1 \\~65 W / PL2 \\~80 W → gets overwritten back to \\~120–140 W once gaming starts.\n* **ThrottleStop:** Not supported on Core Ultra → dead end.\n* **Windows Power Options:** Setting Maximum Processor State = 99% (and Minimum = 5%) → disables turbo, drops CPU temps 8–15 °C; 95% drops even more but with a bigger FPS hit.\n* **Lenovo Vantage:** Switching between Performance/Balanced/Quiet helps somewhat (seems to flip hidden PL tables), but there are no raw PL1/PL2 sliders visible.\n* **GPU (MSI Afterburner):** Undervolt/curve works; monitored with HWINFO—voltage \\~0.7–0.85 V, clocks \\~2.2–2.3 GHz, temps 60–78 °C.\n* **Cooling:** Elevated rear / cooling pad → small but useful temp reductions.\n\n**My questions (especially for Legion + Core Ultra owners)**\n\n1. Is there any BIOS or hidden Vantage option on the Legion 5i (83NX0000US) to manually set CPU PL1/PL2 or allow undervolting on Meteor Lake?\n2. Is there a reliable way to keep XTU limits from being reset by EC/DTT when a game launches, or is that just not possible on this model?\n3. Are there specific Vantage profiles (Balanced/Quiet/Performance/Custom) that meaningfully lower CPU power/temps in PUBG without a big FPS loss?\n4. For PUBG specifically (CPU-heavy, and those smoke effects spike the GPU), any settings combo that helps reduce CPU spikes? Like View Distance, Effects/Shadows tuning that other owners recommend?\n5. If the firmware locks are hard, are my only long-term options:\n   * Stick with 99% Max Processor State (no Turbo) while gaming,\n   * External cooling pad / repaste (or liquid metal, if I'm feeling brave), and\n   * Keep using the GPU undervolt for efficiency?\n\n**Extra context on GPU curve weirdness (MSI Afterburner)**\n\nI noticed the curve \"re-draw\" itself after Apply/reboot. From what I've read in community threads: that's NVIDIA GPU Boost doing its temperature/load compensation thing with the 15 MHz step behavior—the offset stays, but the drawn MHz shifts a bit.\n\nEven if the editor looks different later, HWINFO shows my voltage/clock under load match the target I set, so the undervolt is definitely applying.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nXTU/ThrottleStop are effectively blocked on my Legion 5i (Ultra 9 275HX). PL1/PL2 reset under load.\n\nPUBG pushes the CPU to \\~100–104 °C at times → thermal throttle kicks in.\n\nBest results so far: Vantage profile + Windows 99% Max Processor State (no Turbo) + GPU undervolt + cooling pad.\n\nLooking for any owner-proven methods to tame these CPU temps (BIOS/Vantage tricks, practical PUBG settings) without taking a huge FPS hit.\n\nThanks in advance! 🙏",
