  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience). I have a Lenovo duet 5 now which I love but the snapdragon is feeling a little long in the tooth when I have more than a few tabs open.\n\nI guess my heart says Lenovo but brain said MacBook Air.",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop. Having good speakers is a great bonus for the Lenovo for me, as well as a bright screen. Don't need maximum power as for heavy workload I want to rely on remote desktops.",
  "Check your local best buys, in my area (SE Michigan) the Lenovo is on BB as a used excellent for $530 which is the right price point. So see if you can find one in your area for that price",
  "Unfortunately not near me but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nWhat do you think the chances of the kompanio lasting close to apple silicon?",
  "Not sure, thats a ChatGPT quesiton lol \n\nHappy hunting, hopefully you can find one soon.   I hear that they are high-end Chromebooks with Spandragon x Elite processors coming; I'm hoping they are here just before the holiday season.",
  "Ended up with the m4 MacBook air. It went on sale on Amazon for 750(!) and I can't find the Lenovo near me. Also mixed in the surface laptop for fun but the air just seems too good. Thanks again for your help!",
  "Looking to buy new laptop under 1200 USD Hey Everyone,\n\nTLDR - \n\nLooking to Buy a reliable professional-grade laptop around 300,000 PKR with strong CPU performance, expandable RAM and SSD options, a capable GPU for rendering, decoding, and solid build quality. Preferably new with local warranty support.\n\nAny recommendations or feedback would be highly appreciated.\n\n\\------------------\n\n# Back Story\n\nAfter a long while, I have finally decided to upgrade my laptop, but the current market dynamics is too confusing for me right now esp. between currency hit, price differences, open-box deals, and Masked/refurbished options, it has been difficult to decide on a laptop that truly fits my needs. I would really appreciate some input from the community.\n\n# Current Setup\n\nI’m currently using an HP ProBook 450 G5 (8th Gen). It has served me well, but it’s beginning to show its age, especially under heavier workloads.\n\n# Requirements\n\nCore Specifications\n\nCondition: Brand new preferred  \nCPU: Intel i7 (H-series or equivalent or better)  \nRAM: 24 GB (16 GB minimum with expansion slot - no soldered ones)  \nStorage - (Must be SSD + HDD option)\n\n* SSD 512 GB for OS (second slot for future expansion is a plus)\n* HDD SATA 1 TB (2.5” inch)\n\nDisplay: At least IPS with decent color accuracy & brightness  \nGPU: Nvidia RTX Ada series or something slightly stronger for rendering, encoding/decoding performance. I can work with gaming series but no older than 4000 series.  \n  \nPorts and Connectivity\n\n* Multiple USB A/B/C 2.0/3.0 ports for accessories (mouse, external drives, cooling stand)\n* 3.5 mm audio jack\n* VGA/HDMI port for external display\n* RJ45 LAN port\n* Wi-Fi 4/5 GHz support\n\nKeyboard and Build\n\n* Full-size backlit keyboard (numpad preferred)\n* Rigid build with minimal flex or hinge wobble. Weight isnt an issue.\n* Easy to open for cleaning or upgrades\n* Local parts availability for future maintenance\n\n# Usage Pattern\n\n* My workload involves heavy office use with constant multitasking, often running numerous browser tabs alongside background tools for downloading and file-syncing. Current system starts to lag with ram & cpu reaching max capacity before apps start crashing.\n* I do not play games on the laptop as I have a ps5 pro for that - so I dont require top end latest GPU.\n\n# Not Considering\n\n* MacBooks, due to hardware/software compatibility issues with some custom tools I use.\n* Touchscreen, 2-in-1, tablets, flipbooks or hand-held devices\n* Desktops, as I often work from multiple client offices and need portability\n\n# Current Thoughts\n\n* I’ve been considering Lenovo ThinkPad T or P Series, but many models seem to use TFT panels by default. \n* HP Victus models have good specifications but poor reviews regarding build quality, screen wobble, and keyboard flex. \n* I’m also uncertain about Intel versus Ryzen options and would appreciate insights on that. \n* My goal is to move to at least an IPS panel, since my current laptop has a TFT. OLED would be ideal, but likely beyond budget.\n\n# Budget: \n\nAround 300,000 PKR\n\n# Important Points\n\n* Models that offer the best balance of performance, portability, display & build quality\n* I would prefer numpad on keyboard but if laptop model is worth it then I can compromise as a trade off.\n\nI know I might be asking for a lot, but any advice or recommendations would really help. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to share their thoughts.",

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Need help choosing a laptop for grad school Ok, Reddit, I need help. TLDR: trying to decide between a single expensive computer with 2 screens, or one of 3 laptops with a color E-ink tablet. Links for all included.\n\nI know very little about computers, but I need a laptop for graduate school. It's online, so all of my textbooks are digital. I get wicked eye pain and migraines when using computers and my cellphone screens for too long, so I also need an E-ink tablet or display for reading. I'm currently using my sister's Microsoft Surface with 16gb RAM and 1TB SSD storage, and it works fast enough for me, so I've narrowed my choices down a bit based on that.\n\nI was going to get this one: \n https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkbook/thinkbook-plus/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-4-13-inch-intel/21jj0003us\n\nThis Lenovo ThinkBook Pro Generation 4 with both an OLED and E-ink screens (and I may still end up going that route), but there are a few detractors. 1) the price: even though it's originally almost $4k, $1,400+ is a lot to spend on a single device that only had 16 gb RAM, and that price doesn't include any extended warranty. 2) If it needs servicing, I'm out both my computer AND my textbook reader until it's fixed, and 3) I need a backlit keyboard. \n\n(My partner is gone 10-12 hours every weekday at work and goes to bed rather early, so we don't get a lot of time together. I have started working on papers and research in bed next to him at night and he just falls asleep while I'm working. He can sleep through pretty much ANYTHING - we joke that he had semi-voluntary narcolepsy! - but I don't want to have to keep the light on in order to do my work. So, backlit keyboard.)\n\nThe other choices I've narrowed down are as follows: \n\nhttps://a.co/d/iUbMkvb\nIt's HP, which I've had before and been somewhat unimpressed with (it wasn't a bad computer, it just didn't wow me), but being a major brand name, I figure if it needs servicing, it will be easier to get done. No backlit keyboard, though.\n\nhttps://a.co/d/ec0KPAQ\nThis is a brand I've never heard of, Rumtuk, but I found a couple reviews online that showed it worked well, even a year later. It's one of the only ones I found with a backlit keyboard in my preferred price range (less than $500 before the protection plan). I'm wary of getting an unknown brand, though (I would get the extended warranty, but if it breaks within the manufacturer's warranty, I'm screwed)\n\nhttps://a.co/d/eEHorDt\nThis is another Lenovo with twice the RAM for not much more price. I'm not a big fan of half the storage being on the cloud, and no backlit keyboard.\n\nAny of these 3 will be paired with a color E-ink tablet, which I'm also still trying to decide on. \n\nHelp me, laptop subreddit! You're my only hope! ",
  "The 2020 King of Portable 2 in 1s: LG Gram 2 in 1 14 inch **EDIT 4 5 MONTHS LATER:** [New Lenovo Carbon Yoga leaked on it's way, might be just enough to compete with the Spin 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lenovo/comments/hh0xzf/in_the_blink_of_an_eye_it_seems_the_almost/)\n\nEDIT 3: Found the mystery, it's the [Acer Spin 5 13.5](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Acer-Spin-3-and-Spin-5-are-now-slimmer-and-get-a-much-needed-upgrade-to-Intel-Ice-Lake.449311.0.html) inch which comes with 3:2 aspect ratio, not the LG Gram. It's not as a wide as the 14 Gram/c940, but it's about as equal in dimensions as the Surface Book 2 (taller than 16:9 14 inch laptops). For this reason + the almost exact same specs as the Gram, it would make it as a solid contender for the real king of 2020 2 in 1 portables.\n\nSmall note: Lenovo's c940 14 inch recieved a BIOS update which now gives about full 10 hour battery life(4K version, UHD probably gets a lot more), ALSO NOW coming close for that 2020 crown. At this point, it's all up to your tastes to which really deserves it.\n\nOriginal post:EDIT 2: So it seems that the aspect ratio of 3:2 in the Gram 2 in 1 was misinformation from a video, as it's apparently a 16:9 ratio instead. I'd still say this 2 in 1 is one of the best since it actually provides a bigger battery with a lot less weight than normal 14 inch models\n\nOriginal post:\n\nAfter a few companies have tried to make the perfect portable 2 in 1 convertible, LG actually went and finally pulled it off among it's competition with it's new Gram 2 in 1 14 inch announced at CES 2020.\n\nMain strong points:\n\nBigger and better battery life, which promises the highest battery life up to date for a 14 inch (not sure how much it was exactly, but I think it was about \\~70,000 mWh sized)\n\nOnly 2 in 1 to weight around 2.5 lb with that big of a battery and screen, making it's tablet mode really easy to use with maximum weight portability in mind\n\nGreat port selection up to HDMI and \\*Thunderbolt 3 (need confirmation there tho since previous Gram 2 in 1 did not have it, reviewer at CES said it might have it)\n\nAnd lastly, Intel's 10th gen chip with 11th gen Iris Plus Graphics for light gaming\n\nAs of now, only the Lenovo c940 could compete against this in the 14 inch category, but with relatively poor battery life and 0.5 pounds extra, the Gram seems to take the cake here. Honorable mentions I'd put the HP Spectre 13 inch late 2019 refresh (16:9 aspect ratio on a 13.3 inch screen tho, horrible design imo) and the new Samsung Galaxy Book Flex (which is like the XPS 13 2 in 1 but arguably better with some extra features with a 16:10 aspect ratio on 13.3 inch).\n\nMy only worries for the LG Gram 2 in 1 2020 so far: chassis hopefully is as sturdy as the c940 (or close to it since c940 has an excellent chassis durability), speaker system will probably not be as good obviously (c940 has Dolby Atmos 360 hinge, hopefully LG's sound will be not completely bad) and Thunderbolt 3's inclusion. Other than those worries, seems to be on it's way to being the 2020 king of portable 2 in 1's.\n\nNote: Did not consider any 2 in 1 15 inches and above since all have weights more than 4 lb and big form factor (while I would say the new HP Spectre x360 15 2020 is the best new coming relatively portable 15 inch 2 in 1, but weighing at 4 lb with a big chassis not many bags can fit, it would basically come at 2nd best portable 2 in 1 for 2020, in case you're looking in the 15 category. If gaming is your thing in the 2 in 1 category then this new HP will probably best fit your needs).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Small but important note: also worried the Gram might not have Windows Hello IR facial recognition, as that I believe is fundamental for any 2 in 1 to have while utilizing in tablet or tent mode. Hopefully it comes with IR additionally to it's finger print Windows Hello scanner to get the real title of (at least almost) perfect 2 in 1 ultraportable.",
  "I'm worried that the thermals will disappoint. The older LG grams were all a little too hot for comfort, an obvious compromise with the design.",
  "[deleted]",
  "2020 and you can't charge via USB-C. It's so usefull when you can charge laptop, for example in train via simple powerbank with PD.",
  "Valid point, but I'm lead to believe all 2 in 1's suffer from this. As an owner of a Lenovo Yoga c940 UHD 14' and past owner of a 2017 HP Spectre x360 13', can confirm both units had/have issues with thermals and sometimes fans spun up while even being at idle. Thankfully I discovered undervolting which quickly fixed that issue pretty fast, as fans (which were always an issue on c940's) barely turn on anymore with idle temps of 39-44 degrees. Before it would almost be at 54-60 on idle occasionally with Windows doing background processes, but undervolting did the trick just right.",
  "Oh well rip, I guess you're right. I saw a top CES laptops for 2020 video and it had mentioned a 3:2 for the 2 in 1. Can't find the original but now that I see your video up close yeah, that's definitely 16:9. I ain't mad tho since I decided to stick with my 14 inch c940 with 16:9 too so now I know I'm not missing much haha.\nThanks for clarifying!",
  "Late comment but, figured which was had the 3:2 aspect ratio: turns out it's the [Acer Spin 5 13.5 inch 2020](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Acer-Spin-3-and-Spin-5-are-now-slimmer-and-get-a-much-needed-upgrade-to-Intel-Ice-Lake.449311.0.html). If you're interested in buying a 2 in 1, that one is definitely now in the competition thanks to that ratio. Edited main post comment.",
  "I'm pretty sure that you can? Just cuz a laptop comes with a proprietary power brick doesn't mean you can't use USB-C to charge it. I've seen even 15 inch which has proprietary and can still charge with USB-C.",
  "Depends on the laptop OFC. Most 2 in 1s pack really small single fan dual heatpipe coolers which are totally inadequate for anything hotter than a dual core and low end GPU. I think a few 15 inch 2 in 1s with dual fan coolers can be relatively cool under loads, but yea, most do get too hot",
  "[deleted]",
  "I have the 2019 version and charge via USB-C all the time so I'm sure you can do it.",
  "For the case of 15 inch, most of them do provide at least minimum adecuate cooling since they use actual dedicated GPUs for gaming/graphic design. Only reason why I excluded them from my analysis is due to body weight (4lb is honestly a bit too much for a 2 in 1) and screen size makes chassis far too big to carry around conventionally in backpacks for most people.",
  "Haha wow. Any reason specifically you didn't like all the ones you returned? What feature do you find them missing so much to not upgrade your c920?",
  "Hi u/teamblades44, what kind of USB-C charger do you use for something with such a big battery (I mean, can any USB-C charger charge as fast as the proprietary power brick?)",
  "Why do you think 4 pounds is too much? My 14 inch laptop is 4 pounds and I wouldn't say it's heavy",
  "You can use any 65 or 90 W USB-c charger.  I think it charges a tiny bit slower but even when I'm using it it still is charging it rather than discharging.",
  "I classify 4 pounds to be a bit on the heavy side for 2 main reasons (one mostly personal other a bit more objective)\n\n1. I carry my laptop in an over the shoulder backpack with a bit of cables and charging equipment. I used to always carry with me a 1.3 pound battery in that bag alongside my old Surface Pro 5, which gave it a bit of weight to the bag but manageable. With the 3 pounds from my c940 and 1.3 from the battery, I do feel shoulder pain when getting home most of the time, so I opted for carrying it my main backpack separately.\n2. My c940 14 inch at 3 pounds is juuust the borderline of what I would consider ideal weight for a 2 in 1. Using it in tablet mode is roughly hard due to weight + sharp edges which stab a bit into the hands, tho I do find 3 pounds to be good enough that the laptop can be held with one hand a bit relatively easy. But at 4 pounds, I wouldn't see myself ever using it in tablet mode and one hand usage would be on the bare minimum there. This is where the new Gram stands out with a killer 3:2 aspect ratio perfect for tablet mode plus an ideal 2.5 weight\n\nWhile I get this might be more personal since it's 1 pound difference from the c940, I know people like to carry light when on the go, and a 15 inch laptop for me is a bit too much for super portability too. Mostly this is just personal tastes, but a 3:2 aspect ratio with 14 inch wideness honestly would be more than good of a display for any needs I would say imo. It all comes down to personal tastes.",
  "If you use it in tablet mode, the weight doesn't matter...\n\nLike it could weight 10 pounds but that won't really affect how you use it as a tablet\n\nBut for day to day carry, I could totally understand wanting something lighter",
  "It actually does matter quite a bit haha, try holding the tablet in the air as you would an iPad to read and your arms will get tired pretty darn quick. Most reviewers always mention this for 2 in 1's since weight is what normally restricts tablet mode for most of them, except this here Gram which finally fixed the issue in a lot of senses.",
  "You don't hold it in your hands. You place it flat on a table like a tablet or drafting table",
  "As someone who suffers from constant neck pains from looking down too much while studying, holding the tablet in the air both in desk and in bed is a godsend feature for me. Really the only think I'll miss from my Surface Pro 5 tbh, since that only weighs a mere 1.7 pounds. I know other people in my school do this hence why I decided to mention it.",
  "Dell XPS, HP Spectre x360, or Razer options, ultraportables vs 15 inch models, trying to decide Sorry for the pseudo double-post since I also posted on Suggest-a-Laptop, but in this case I have three laptops that I've researched fairly extensively and want opinions regarding them specifically more so than a person sending me a link of laptops meeting my \"form\" specification.\n\n\\* \\*\\*Total budget and country of purchase:\\*\\*\n\nUSA. Ideally sub-$2k budget, but I could be convinced to spend more for a machine that will last longer, or combined with an eGPU or separate desktop later on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\\*\\*\n\nI don't care about 2 in 1, but my most recent computers have been a Surface Pro and then the late 2016 Razer Blade Stealth with touch. I absolutely cannot get another laptop/hybrid without a touch screen. I use it more than the trackpad. Before that, I used a Thinkpad joystick/nipple, so I've never felt comfortable with trackpads. I currently use my RBS with a mouse/monitor setup, or on my lap with a mix of trackpad and touch screen. Mostly touch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\\*\\*\n\nPrior to the Surface Pro, I had an IBM and then a Lenovo Thinkpad. They started to feel too clunky when I started carrying my computer with me everywhere. I do value something slimmer, something in the ultrabook or lighter weight 15\". (E.G. XPS15, Razer Blade, but not a 17\", and not a fat ugly gaming rig).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\\*\\*\n\nWindows\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\\*\\*\n\n13-15\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\\*\\*\n\nMostly general use, but also would like to be able to play some games, some AI use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\\*\\*\n\nWould be nice to hit at least 60fps for recent games at low-medium settings. Not required for the ultrabook, say, if I got another thin-and-light computer with Thunderbolt connectivity for an eGPU.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\\*\\*\n\n\\-Portability: Ideally portable. Razer Blade 15 is about as heavy as I'm interested in.\n\n\\-Touch: Absolutely need touch-screen. As stated above.\n\n\\-Build quality: I've had some problems with recent computers, so I'm not sold on the idea that one company or another is or isn't great. My IBM Thinkpad after about 5 years of life had issues with overheating despite new thermal paste application (but probably lasted the longest). The Lenovo was never reliable. I switched to the Surface Pro... which was pretty great except for the charging adapter being absolutely terrible and not registering (which I noted with other users as well), and after getting a replacement that worked for some time... it also stopped working very well, and by then I'd run out of memory and wanted something with more I/O... so the Razer Blade Stealth had the expected issue of not registering the battery appropriately, and on day one I had to download a BIOS update (known issue I had seen in one of the reviews when I purchased the computer). I needed to send it in for an RMA due to constant freeze/buzzing issues (they told me they eventually replaced the motherboard). Recently it's been acting up making a loud crackling/buzzing noise (no freezing, not coil whine) that's probably related to the fan, but can go weeks at a time without issue... that's made me reticent to bring my poor computer out in public... Basically I've had a bad experience with Razer, but then again, I've not had the best experience with Microsoft or Lenovo either. Hopefully just bad luck, and the next computer will be a bit luckier...\n\n\\-Ports: I need Thunderbolt since I want the option for an eGPU or a Thunderbolt dock. In the past I've tried a regular USB dock with past computers, and there was too much lag to make it useful. I also want more ports than what Microsoft is offering with any of their new offerings. If they had come up with a Surface Book 3 with updated hardware, I would have been interested. At minimum, I don't want to lose ports (currently USB-C + 2x USB-A and HDMI). XPS 2 in 1 feels ridiculous. One charging USB-C, and one to plug things into. XPS 13 laptop is essentially a step backwards with one USB-C used for charging, one to replace HDMI, would then leave me with one fewer USB port available. Probably fine to get a dock, giving me two USB ports. Spectre 13 similarly loses me a USB port if I didn't have a dock. The new RBS keeps ports, but has other drawbacks. The alternative is getting a 15\" model but losing portability in favor of power and ports.\n\n\\-Memory: I need at least 512GB, preferably NVMe SSD. Would like 16GB+ for RAM, especially for the 13\" models as RAM is usually not upgradeable.\n\n\\-Display: My perfect laptop doesn't exist. If I get a 13\", I don't need to sacrifice battery for 4k since I can't tell the difference anyway, but the only touch options at this size seem to be 4k displays. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\\*\\*\n\nI THINK I've narrowed my list down to two categories, and three options within each (Razer, HP Spectre x360, or Dell XPS):\n\n1. Ultra-portable with plan for a secondary Thunderbolt dock or eGPU\n2. 15\" that still maintains some portability.\n\nUltra-portable:\n\n1. Razer Blade Stealth late 2019:\n   1. Don't lose any ports, maintain a light form factor with improvement in bezels, and actually increased power that would still allow \"light\" gaming.\n   2. The GTX1650 is fine... but comes at the cost of 15w for the CPU, basically throttling the CPU in favor of having a decent GPU. I'm not sure the extra price is worth what really isn't a gaming machine. (Comes in at $1900)\n   3. Honestly would be happy to get an Iris Plus Graphics model, would LOVE Mercury White... but those options are either NOT touch-screen or not 512GB for the SSD. Cheapest touch option (if I am understanding the Razer site) is an MX150 with 8th gen CPU and 4k panel for $1700, and it just doesn't seem to make sense to pay so much for an \"older\" model with a weaker GPU, though true it is an actual dedicated GPU.\n   4. Doesn't have microSD (though I haven't felt like I \"needed\" it as long as I have enough local memory and cloud options).\n2. Dell XPS 13 or XPS 13 2-in-1\n   1. Minimal ports. Boo. But could dock it.\n   2. XPS 13 has the \"other\" Intel 10th gen CPU, so maybe not as optimized for minor graphics/AI? However, it is 6-core, so maybe more powerful. The 2-in-1 uses Iris Plus but is even MORE limited in ports. I am fine with a touch laptop, but if equally viable, I'd go for one that can do full double duty as a hybrid. Again, supposing I use a dock, the port issue is fine? This all assumes that Thunderbolt docks work reasonably well without the lag I've experienced with \"regular\" USB docks.\n   3. XPS 2-in-1 seems to have a non-4k option, which might save some battery life and price.\n   4. Quality control issues?\n3. HP Spectre x360 13, late 2019\n   1. This is what I'm leaning toward. Also lose a port (like the XPS 13), but better than the XPS 2-in-1 and in a similar form factor, with a sleek almost bezel-less design. Would have to dock. Coming in at $1500, so pretty much the cheapest option (or about tied with the XPS13).\n   2. Comes with a pen! lol\n   3. I am having trouble determining if the CPU has 15w or 25w (Iris Plus version of 10th gen). Also not sure if the SSD is NVMe?\n   4. Like the others, only 4k options, though people seem to like the screen, and if the non-touch can reach 22hours (company testing conditions), then the OLED should probably still have reasonable battery life.\n   5. Quality control issues?\n\n15\"\n\n1. Razer Blade 15\n   1. As much as I want one of these, I can't really justify paying $3100 for the cheapest touch option. Unless there's some non-4k, or non-GTX2080 configuration I can get, anything reasonably priced is non-touch. I don't need a fantastic video card, but in the 15\" model, I do want a usable GPU. The reasonably priced ($1700-1800 options) have GTX1060Ti or 2060, but sadly no touch screen. Even with older models.\n   2. Anyone see a perfect Blade out there?\n2. HP Spectre x360 15\n   1. As much as I like the 13 inch model, I haven't really seen any reviews online for the new 15 inch model.\n   2. This is the only 2-in-1 15\" option I'm currently looking at.\n   3. $1700 (or possibly $1530 with discounts), this is the cheapest 15\" model I see among those I'm looking at most closely. However, the GPU seems to be sacrificed, with MX250 as the option.\n3. Dell XPS 15\n   1. This is probably the one I would lean toward. For $2k I could get 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD, lots of ports, GTX1650, touch, on a 6-core 9th gen CPU.\n\nSo basically looking at any experiences people have had with any of the above options. Would love to hear how the new Spectre is working out, if you found a better Razer configuration, if you've had QC issues with Dell or HP or Razer, what you might lean toward. I'm also open to other ideas (I haven't looked too deeply at the Lenovo Yoga models, for instance). I love the Surface lineup in general, but I feel like I'm probably getting more for my money with these options... though it would be nice to have an actual brick-and-mortar option for when any problems arise. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this!",

  "Proceed with caution. For that price, I'd say to just go ahead and buy it and see what happens, considering you're on [store.lenovo.com](http://store.lenovo.com), but I'm still very suspicious about it. There's no reason they'd actually sell anything for that price, unless it was a mistake on the website. However, if it is a mistake and it lets you place the order, it's possible that they might still honor the purchase and just eat the loss as a result of their mistake and still send it to you. It looks like the actual Lenovo website. Look closely at the URL, and type in the Lenovo website URL manually and navigate there directly to make sure you're at the right place. If you still see it there, maybe try and see if it lets you order.",

I only learned this after a month of waiting for it to arrive and it being in the ready to ship stage, still showing that they had stock. When the error was discovered they offered to cancel my order and find a machine that “fit” my needs at whatever price they were selling it at. No, I wanted a machine with the closest specifications at the price that I ordered and paid for the first one that you said you had in stock. They didn’t budge at all. I ordered a machine at $250, the next one that had the closest specifications was $750. The original price of the machine I ordered was $950.

  "This is what I'm thinking.

  "Yea, like my dad saw a wrong price on jbls site, 0 euro soundbar, and he ordered one, but then he ordered 15 more. Im pretty sure thats the reason that they catched it. A while ago i saw a wrong price on jbls site, 25 euros for a flip 4 camo. I ordered one and actually recieved it",
  "Most likely true. I work at a very large company and work in picking and shipping orders, and it's generally the same for every company. If a product is in stock and is purchased, the order is automatically added to the queue and dropped in the next wave of orders for the warehouse workers to pick and ship it. \n\nMany times the packlist/order receipt will show the total price of the order, but nobody really pays attention and even if a warehouse grunt sees it, they will assume nothing and still send it out. No managers or financial workers will see the order until well after it is shipped and delivered in most cases",
  "I have worked at a popular grocery store for over a decade. In the U.S. if a store has a price sign in front of a product that indicates an incorrect price, we have to honor it. Otherwise it’s called bait and switch. I have no idea how this is handled online or internationally however.",
  "They don’t. Law undergraduate here. This falls under contract law. A website listing or product is considered as an **invitation to treat**, and not an **offer**. To define an offer, I will quote it from the case of Preston Corpn Sdn Bhd v Edward Leong: An offer is an intimation of willingness by an offeror to enter into a legally binding contract. Its terms either expressly or impliedly must **indicate** that it is to **become binding on the offeror** (buyer) assoon as it has been **accepted by the offeree** (seller).\n\nEven if the customer were to send an offer (by checking out), a **binding contract** is not yet formed because Lenovo has yet to accept that offer and they can choose to back out as there is no **legally enforceable agreement** yet. (A confirmation email is also not signifying of acceptance of order!)\n\nA similar example to this would be Chwee Kin Keong v Digiland Mall Pte Ltd. TLDR is that an employee keyed in a pricing for a product at $66 instead of $3,854 (MSRP) and the company obviously didn’t want to fulfil orders that were made and got taken to court. Court ruled in the company’s favour.\n\nIn consumer court, courts do consistently rule in favour of the seller during obvious pricing mistakes like a $1 phone etc. because they take the view of a **reasonable person in consideration and apply the objectivity test**. \n\nFor example, in this case, the court said:\n“I find ... that the plaintiffs, given each of their backgrounds, would in any event, each have separately realised and appreciated, before placing their purchase orders,that a manifest mistake had occurred – even if no communications on the error had taken place between them. Further, the character of the mistake was such that **any reasonable person** similarly circumstanced as each of the plaintiffs would have had every reason to believe that a manifest error had occurred.” . \n\nOtherwise, the court would also simply treat it as a **clerical or unilateral mistake** and not punish the seller. Similarly in this case, Lenovo would win.\n\nIf there’s any Law graduates reading this and want to improve on my stand, please do! I’m still studying and open to improvement",
  "Nope where it's clearly a mistake and you know it, they don't need to honour it",
  "They are not and three seconds of googling will support that. Just because you once managed to slip one through doesn’t mean that’s the law.\n\nImagine a computer store mislabelling a €4000 laptop at €1 and a large amount of units are ordered overnight while nobody’s at work. Your argument is that EU law now effectively forces this company into bankruptcy by being required to honor these sales that were clearly made exploiting an error in pricing?",
  "No....",
  "Depends on the Ts and Cs",
  "Yeah.... depends on if that's enforceable to a website in another country.... Much like the GDPR fines the EU charges.... a US website isn't subject to that....  even if they decide to keep data on you... because they're not breaking THEIR laws.",
  "had this happen in the us with a 5000 dollar tv listed for 5.\n\n  \nthey cancelled the order and gave us a 20 dollar off of 100 or more coupon.\n\n  \nthis was on Samsungs website a few years back.\n\n  \nmaybe the uk is protected against this somehow but I’m almost positive there’s some loophole that companies could take advantage of to cancel it. regardless, it’s worth a try if it’s from the legit website",

It's server-client thing – client sends response (get/post etc.), site's backend transfers specific data to the client (rendering the page if needed and so on). Done.",

  "True, but I was just giving an example to explain. However, if we look at it in layman terms, the universal legal principle will be the same. You simply cannot reasonably expect to enforce a contract based on a price that is **obviously an error**. So in any jurisdiction, I’m highly confident that Lenovo would win should this be taken to court. \n\nIf you search up similar topics, you will find that across common law (Singapore, UK, US) and civil law (France, Germany, EU), the courts follow the same reasoning:\n1.\tObvious pricing errors = no binding contract.\n2.\tBuyers cannot exploit a mistake they recognize.\n3.\tThe worst that happens to the retailer is refunding the money.\n\nHowever, if we are referring to say, a $599 MSRP laptop being listed erroneously at $499, the court may order the seller to honor some of the orders, which has happened in many jurisdictions before, since borderline errors (e.g., 10–25% off normal price) can be interpreted as a discount/promotion and would lead a reasonable person to believe that there is no mistake in pricing.\n\nIn this case though, it’s a laptop for $1. So it’s pretty obvious and no court would side with the buyer.",
  "Incorrect.\nTL;DR Lenovo (and most other companies) explicitly states that a confirmation email does **NOT** signify acceptance of the order. **No acceptance = No contract.** (This clause is commonplace for every business) Consumer will lose if he tries to go to court, even if he has the best lawyer. Below, I will cite Lenovo.\n\n**Full explanation:**\n\nA confirmation email, if you dig deep into any businesses’s Terms and Conditions (the thing that everyone ignores), has built in protective clauses in their Terms of Sale, and they’re not obliged to provide the consumer with any goods or service with a confirmation email alone. **Confirmation email ≠ acceptance.** A confirmation email only signifies that they have **received** the order.\n\nHere, I will specifically cite for this case, Lenovo. Under their T&Cs, it clearly states that **a confirmation of Lenovo receiving and/or processing your order does not constitute acceptance of the order.** (1.2)\n\nSource: https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/legal/new-products-and-warranty-services/?srsltid=AfmBOop9YcXqtlgbWWSEtLd4WCy7paTFtCMABKIs8xZmfYyPvIBRyTbc&ut\n\nIt also states under 1.1 that:\n\n1.1) **No contract** for the purchase of Products or Services will be formed until Lenovo accepts your Order by **one of the following**:\n\n**(a)** shipping the hardware Product and sending you a shipment confirmation email; or\n\n**(b)** making the software Product available to you; or\n\n**(c)** providing the Service to you.\n\nTherefore, that confirmation email is **not a binding acceptance** and is more of an acknowledgment that they’ve received your order and are processing it. Until shipping occurs (or software is delivered, etc.), Lenovo **reserves the right** to cancel or adjust your order **even if** you’ve already received a confirmation email or any other form of confirmation.\n\nI personally think that TV shows these days make the law seem very shallow to the average person, like; “Little guy sues company and wins!”. \n\nThe reality is, that every business has multiple built in protective and failsafe clauses layered into their contracts etc. to make sure that real consumers **will never win against them** in court. I feel like the average person should read more into the T&Cs so they know what they’re getting themselves into, but we don’t, so companies take advantage of that; and that is why we have lawyers :)",
  "Do enlighten me. 99% of companies in the EU are labeled “micro scale”. And also, way to deflect from the question about legislation ;)\n\n“A couple ten thousand dollars” in this case would be 5-10 laptops sold at the wrong price. You can see from this topic that ppl flock to these things like moths to a flame.\n\nMy most commonly used online computer store typically has a stock of about 50 of each gaming laptop, do the math on a say 5 of those products being mislabeled overnight and each those selling out at a €3999 discount. That’s about a million euro lost on a clear database error. “Just suck it up, it’s the law”, yeah not so much bro.",

  "Lenovo Ideapad slim 3 gen 10 AMD 14\" So i bought this laptop for £469 in the UK for university and i have had it for about a week now and I have not seen any reviews so i thought i would leave a review. It has a ryzen 5 8640hs with integrated radeon graphics, 16gb ram dual channel and a 60wh battery\n\nBuild quality: This laptop is made of sturdy plastic, the finish feels very nice but it is nothing to boast about, it is good enough for the price. I like how it is very lightweight and is really easy to carry around.\n\nDisplay: The anti-glare coating is great for this and really helps when it is sunny outside and the sun is very bright. 1920x1200 is very sharp but other than that its a regular 60hz IPS panel but it definitely gets the job done.\n\nKeyboard: This one does not come with a full size keyboard but I am not too bothered by this personally as I dont usually use the rest of the other keys. Sometimes I do press the wrong keys but once you get used to it, its a solid keyboard.\n\nPerformance: The CPU in this is very fast, whatever I do happens in an instant whether im video editing, watching videos, playing games or in a meeting. The 16gb ram also plays a huge role in this. What surprised me the most was the performance of the GPU considering its only 15W. I dont play very heavy games but this GPU was able to run forza horizon 4, fortnite, GTA, battlefield 1 and hollow Knight at good fps(these are the games I usually play). I also did some wii u emulation and it was flawless. One thing I will mention is that the laptop can be quite noisy when gaming on extreme performance mode but is very quiet when not being pushed.\n\nBattery: The battery on this is great for what it is. I was able to achieve around 7-8 hours from 100 percent to 20 whilst just doing my assignments(on battery saver). I got around 5-6 hours on netflix. When gaming the max i got was around 3 hours of battery life which is not too bad.",

  "Nice review, I just bought the version with AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS with dual RAM of 8 GB each. I hope I don't regret it, but the price of €630 seemed very advantageous to me honestly",
  "How good an idea is it to get this same version but with 24GB of RAM for $800? Considering that I live in Chile and our prices tend to be higher than those in first-world countries.",
  "Hi! Thanks for the review. Do you think it's worth getting the Ryzen 78840HS version for 40€ more?? I'm gonna be using it for university work. Music production software and other music related software and some gaming",

  "I know it's an old post but how is the laptop holding up so far ?",
  "Hi I’ve had this laptop for over a month now and it’s been pretty good thus far but have a few issues/concerns and wanted to see if others are having! 1. The trackpad is not good my fingers dont move on it well and it doesn’t feel sturdy it feels pretty cheap. 2. I might of banged it at some stage but I noticed with the display when it shows black things the pixels are blue in a certain spot only a little you can barely notice it but it bothers me.",
  "No problem its a great laptop for its price, still going strong right now",
  "How is the battery?",
  "As far as I'm aware the \"24GB\" version doesn't exist, it can just support up to 24GB, as in you need to buy extra memory and install it yourself. If that's 800USD that's a disgusting price. Are Apple products also more expensive there? Personally I'd be looking into an Air M4 for that price.",
  "Dont get it, its not worth it at that price point",
  "Absolutely, that ryzen 7 is quite a bit faster and will be better for running multiple tasks, the igpu on it is slightly faster than the ryzen 5 one by about 10%. For €40 more yeah i would say its worth it",
  "Cant really say but its most likely similar to this one but with a stronger gpu and cpu",
  "Its holding up great the battery and performance is still good",
  "In reality it has yet to arrive, they're taking a long time to ship and maybe I'm changing my mind, opting for a thinkpad for €100 more though",
  "Hi, this I assume. Does your model support DP Alt Mode 1.4?",

  "Dell Precision 16 7680 vs Lenovo P16 Gen 3 vs other contenders? — the best bang for your buck for office/business/logistic/investment work. Hello,\n\nMy brother is looking to invest in a new laptop for another few years. Since, he won't be gaming, rendering videos, etc., a dedicated GPU is not a must. Actually it might be even a better option = no overheating, more space inside, etc., but I don't know.\n\nAfter some reading we have opted for those two series, but we're open for any other suggestions as well. From what I've read Dell is not that great and many people hate them, have trouble with them, etc. The guarantee is great though (what I read).   \n  \nIf you have any experience with the current/past series, brand ,etc. every bit of information would be very helpful.\n\nSince he wants this laptop to last him for at least 5+ years, we have opted for 64GB RAM, and some fast CPU to go along with it.\n\nHe browses a lot of carts at the same time, ChatGPT, etc. His current laptop =  \n  \nHP ProBook 470 G5  \n\n\n... is a bit sluggish at times, keyboard giving up, heating up with CPU usage of 100%, you know... your typical bs laptop experience lol  \n\n\nI would call his work he does on a laptop a typical office/business stuff. He works in logistics so he has a few programs opened up at all times as well.\n\nThis is why it needs to be brisk as hell, so he can jump in-between everything without any hiccups./ \n\nWindows 11 will definitely not help with the task, but it's a must.\n\n\n\nGaming PCs are rather easy in comparison with laptops lol. I have no clue about them.\n\n  \nOnce again, any past/current experience, suggestions, info., etc. will be of great help to narrow down some potential.",

  "Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Gen 6: First impressions I purchased the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G6, model 21NQCTO1WWBR1 on July 2025 and would like to make my impressions about this product:\n\nDESIGN AND BUILD: We don't have much to comment on the design, as it's quite minimalist. We're surprised that not all the keyboard keys follow Lenovo's signature layout, as is typical on IdeaPads, but at least the Ctrl and Fn keys are in their traditional positions, unlike ThinkPads. The light color isn't bad, but it's a shame there wasn't a darker color option (not black, which is typically only seen on ThinkPads, but a darker gray would have been nice). The touchpad is a good size. We found the number of ports interesting, but the Ethernet port's position wasn't particularly helpful, being on the right side. It's interesting that it also has an SD card reader. The number of LEDs also caught our attention, with one next to each USB-C port, in addition to the power button itself (which we really like being separate from the keyboard). We liked the backlit keyboard and the dedicated \"?\", \"/\", \"°\", and \"Menu\" keys, although they sacrificed one of the Ctrl keys. At least it didn't come with the \"Copilot\" shortcut. We didn't really like the notch in the webcam area and found it a rather questionable design decision, but we understand its usefulness. We also liked that it came without those infamous labels on the palm rest, just the Intel seal.\n\nSCREEN: We liked the quality of the IPS, but we were disappointed that the screen had excessive IPS Glow at the bottom edge, quite visible with the screen on a black background even in bright light. My brother was okay with it, but I didn't like this defect at all, which I'm already accepting is quite common in current LCD screens, as I've also seen notebooks and even smartphones and tablets from other brands with this issue. It shouldn't happen, but we've come to understand that IPS Glow is now part of the experience of having an IPS LCD screen, which is unfortunate. At least we like the thin bezels.\n\nSOUND AND WEBCAM: Neither impressed in any aspect, but neither disappointed.\n\nBATTERY AND CHARGING: The USB-C charger is interesting. My brother tested it by playing YouTube videos in 1080p with maximum brightness, and it lasted over 5 hours unplugged. For a 60Wh battery, it's an okay battery, but it could be better.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND USABILITY: Regarding performance, considering its specifications, I consider it okay. It worked very well even for running virtual machines via VirtualBox. We didn't notice excessive heat on the keyboard when heavily loaded. My brother installed the Big Linux distro, and in testing, it has worked well, including mirroring the laptop screen to our Smart TV wirelessly. My brother was unable to get BlissOS, based on Android 13, to work, as it didn't recognize Wi-Fi, but emulating Android on Big Linux with WayDroid has worked well most of the time.\n\n**Have you also purchased a Lenovo ThinkBook? Share your experiences with it in the comments below.**",

  "I got the same laptop, with 8gb of RAM, and im quite satisfied with it. I use it mainly for college stuff, and it can handle an entire day of coding, browsing the internet and even playing some light games (such as Horizon Chase). \n\nBattery life on it is quite impressive on linux. I get 6-8h of usage with it. That's more than i get with Windows (i have no idea why i just get 3-5 hours on Windows), but i've seen some minor compatibility issues on linux, such as the mute key not lighting up or the volume keys getting \"sticky\" (if i hold it a little bit, it goes to max volume or 0), but overall, the laptop is very usable.\n\nI plan to upgrade to 16gb soon, because on my use case, 8gb is too low, especially when i get 16 tabs open for research + some niche software from 10 years and VScode.\n\nOBS: Você é o CAVBR do fórum Adrenaline, não é?",

  "BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH AFTER NVIDIA DRIVER UPDATE: Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 (i5-10th Gen, GTX 1650) has NO DISPLAY on internal or external ports. Seeking Community Help! Hello everyone,\n​I urgently need help. My laptop shows absolutely no display after updating the video driver. The keyboard lights up, but the screen stays completely black, and the HDMI output also shows nothing.\n​The Failure occurred on: 10/22/2025\n​My Laptop Specifications (Crucial Info):\n​Model: Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 (System Model: 81Y4 / 15IMH05).\n​Processor: Intel Core(TM) i5-10300H (10th Gen).\n​Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 (dedicated GPU) and Intel UHD Graphics (integrated GPU).\n​RAM: 16 GB DDR4.\n​The Problem:\n​The failure occurred immediately after running a driver update for the GTX 1650 using the official NVIDIA software (GeForce Experience). After the mandatory reboot, the display never came back on.\n​Diagnostic Steps I ALREADY TOOK (No Success):\n​Hard Reset: Disconnected the power adapter and battery (internal/external), drained residual power (held power button for 60 seconds), and powered on with the charger only.\n​External Display Test: Connected the laptop via HDMI to an external TV/Monitor. There is NO image on the external screen.\n​RAM Module Testing: Opened the chassis and tested each 8 GB RAM stick individually in both slots. Still a black screen.\n​Force Safe Mode: Forced Windows into Automatic Repair (power cycling 3 times). I have no display to select the boot options.\n​Novo Button: Tried accessing the BIOS/Recovery Menu using the dedicated Lenovo Novo Button. The keyboard lights, but the screen remains black.\n​I Need Guidance on USB BIOS Flash (Crisis Recovery):\n​I suspect the BIOS firmware managing GPU initialization is corrupted, and a USB flash is my last resort before professional service.\n​My Specific Questions:\n​Which BIOS file should I download (version name and extension) for my 81Y4/15IMH05 model?\n​What is the exact key combination for my model (e.g., \\text{Fn} + \\text{R} while plugging in power) to initiate the Crisis Recovery?\n​Is there a specific filename that the recovery system must recognize on the FAT32 formatted USB drive (e.g., BIOS.CAP or MAIN.FD)?\n​Is there any additional test related to the internal battery I should perform (e.g., disconnecting it for a longer period) to ensure a complete chipset reset?\n​What other alternative solutions do you think might work?\n​I greatly appreciate all your comments, thanks.",

  "Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15ACH6 – A review and upgrade path First, I’ll tell you about myself. Mainly because it could help you decide on getting the same or a similar laptop if you have similar needs to me. I’m a mechanical engineering student. Currently, I use CAD somewhat frequently for college and \\*very\\* frequently for personal use, so a dedicated GPU was pretty much necessary. A decently Good CPU was also needed for simulation work and \\*very\\* amateurish programming. Video and image editing are also hobbies of mine, but I don’t do anything extravagant so they weren’t really a deciding factor. I also love to be dramatic and firmly believe I am a professional writer. I’m not, so if you don’t like that kind of writing, I’ll leave a TL;DR at the end of this post.\n\nSo, the laptop. The IdeaPad 3 Gaming I bought comes with a wired RGB mouse I will probably not use (it’s still in its sealed bag), some very disappointing manuals and guides (I just downloaded the actual ones from Lenovo’s site) and a 135W AC charger. Internally, it has a Ryzen 5 5600H, a single 8 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM RAM clocked at 3200 MHz, one 512 GB M.2 Samsung NVMe Gen3x4 SSD (model is MZ-ALQ512B), a Nvidia RTX 3050 4GB and finally a 15.6” 1080p 120 Hz display.\n\nI actually wanted to do this just because of this next section: Upgrades. I’ve always been a sucker for high-capacity drives, so the tiny 512 GB of space made me feel uneasy every single time I thought about my locally stored movies, TV shows, comics, games… Point is: I wanted to upgrade. Problem was: I read online that only the 2242 M.2 slot (the one with the stock SSD) could reach Gen4 speeds.\n\nI’ve also read only that this thing would NOT work with a higher than 512 GB drive on the 2242 slot. I just ignored that and got a 2 TB Crucial P310 Gen4 drive. FUCK. YEAH.\n\nI found it on Micro Center for sale at $149.99 USD too. This is important because my third-world mind was already going crazy inside that celestial store. I felt like I was dreaming in that GPU aisle. The custom keyboards too???? I loved every single plack-time I spent in there. My dad (we were on a business trip btw) was searching for a USB to VGA cable and they had it. WHAT. Who even needs that? Truly, an ascending and heavenly experience.\n\nAnyways. I was very worried it wouldn’t work. I already have a fully functional 2 TB NVMe and a 1 TB SATA drive on my PC, so if this didn’t work I just wasted half my salary in something I would 100% not be able to sell at that same price. Not to mention, I still needed an adapter. This thing is 2230, and if you remember correctly, the slot only fits 2242 drives. So…\n\nI’ll go over how good it performs now:\n\n* Gaming\n\nIn the very few games I tested, it was a very good experience. I mostly play only old games, so this might not mean much to you, but Bayonetta, Sonic X Shadow Generations and Rocket League ran perfectly fine. In Bayonetta’s case, it ran even better than on my desktop -$1200- gaming PC, which honestly doesn’t mean much since it barely counts as running in that system.\n\n* CAD\n\nThe most important thing to me. It runs flawlessly. And now, we go back to the Crucial drive! I designed the adapters using Inventor 2025 on the base laptop (as in “stock configuration”). The only problem I could name is that, for some reason, it takes Inventor like a whole minute to load the first project. Be it a fully finished model or just a blank file. It’s very weird.\n\nAfter finishing the model and getting it printed, I was ready to see if my dumb ass would be enjoying two whole terabytes of data on his new laptop.\n\n \n\nIt. Worked.\n\n \n\nI was so stupidly happy. And you know what? I haven’t mentioned that I also installed two 16 GB 3200 MHz sticks. EVERYTHING WORKED WITH NO ISSUES. It felt amazing. The trip to Micro Center, the fact that I was actually upgrading a laptop, the excitement I felt going into the Amazon Locker to retrieve my shiny new 32 gigs of RAM… Truly a wonderful experience.\n\nAfter I installed Windows I decided to check both drive’s speeds, just to be sure. Another big discovery for us; 15ACH6 owners. Turns out that if you only have ONE M.2 drive installed, the drive will run at full Gen3x4 speeds. The damn manual says it runs at Gen3x2, but that is almost a complete lie. Thing is, if you install TWO NVMe drives, the speeds get halved, effectively functioning as two Gen3x2 slots. I’ll add the CrystalDiskMark results as pictures if you want to check them.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI’m really enjoying this laptop. It’s a very capable device. I can confirm that it supports up to 32 GB and a 2 TB NVMe drive and would recommend having just one of those installed to maximize speeds.",

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review I bought this Chromebook about a week ago from  Curry's in the UK as the top spec had a deal on for £599.\n\nMy honest opinion using it for my business is that it nails it with only one downside. \n\nI run my own business Functional Drinks Club which has bricks and mortar stores and an online store. \n\nI'm also a Fractional CMO for a UK based tech company. \n\nI hate the Apple OS and eco-system, so Macbooks are always out for me. \n\nAnd I hate how even the best window laptops can get slowed down with anti-virus software and other various plug-inside just to keep them safe while I'm working from different locations. \n\nSo, the Chromebook was always going to get my interest. \n\nWhat I mainly use it for:\n\nShopify Store Management\nMeta Ad Management\nSocial Media Managament\nG-Suite (Pro Business Account)\nSocial Media Creation (FB, Insta, Tik Tok, LinkedIn, YT) \nQuickbooks Accountant Software \nVideo Call Meetings \nCanva - Design needs\nRiverside.Fm for video podcasts and basic editinf\nHubspot CRM Management \n\nI can safely say that it nailed all of the above with aplomb, and because I like to be mobile it's the perfect laptop (not just chromebook) for my business. \n\nNote: I don't do heavy, complex video editing as part of the above.  \n\nThe only downside is that when it comes to printing shipping labels from shopify it only recognises known brand names when it comes to label printers. \n\nThere is a workaround extension for it, but it's a pain in the butt if I'm honest to get working.\n\nThat's it. \n\nI use the Chromebook as my day to day now and I'm not going back.

  "Most Honest Review of the Lenovo Yoga 7i – Only 3 days in*  \n\nKeep in mind I’m only three days into my new purchase of the Lenovo Yoga 7i 14, but so far I’m really impressed. After returning my M2 Macbook Air Last October, I had been in the market for a new laptop for quite some time, and the Yoga was always something I was considering. The no touchscreen on the Macbook Air simply wasn’t cutting it for me, which is why I ended up returning it despite my relative investment in the Apple ecosystem (ipad pro m1, iphone 12 pro, airpods pro)\n\nMy model: i7 1255U, 16GB DDR5 Memory, 512GB SSD\n\n**Performance:** So far, the performance has been great. Not sure if it’s the marketing gimmick, but the evo certified i7 CPU is quick and extremely responsive in ways that my desktop isn’t. For quick tasks such as opening your apps from the taskbar or simply interacting with the Windows UI, it’s a very snappy chip that has yet to disappoint whatsoever. The 16GB of DDR5 memory is also impressive here, and I’m able to keep dozens of tabs open on Microsoft Edge without any hassle. Definitely think the upgrade was worth it in this sense, 8GB just never seems to cut it these days.\n\n**Display**: One of the best features of this laptop, and is Dolby Vision certified. It has a really nice looking and glossy 2K resolution that looks great from writing documents to watching Netflix–you can definitely notice the upgraded resolution in this sense. I’ve heard some complaints about the display being too glossy, but I prefer it over a matte finish because it feels nicer to navigate on when in touch mode (although it *can* become a fingerprint magnet at times). \n\n**Keyboard:** Keeping this section short and simple. The BEST laptop keyboard I’ve ever typed on. When I first tried it, I was shocked at the switches’ tactility and it was honestly a bit harsh but I’m getting more used to it. \n\n**Trackpad:** Not the best. One of the few downsides of this laptop. The material feels nice, but its touch sensitivity could be improved. \n\n**Battery Life:** Also, not the worst but could be better. I’ve been using battery savings mode on Windows 11 which has seemed to mitigate some of the battery life issues I was initially having. I believe Lenovo advertises over 10 hours and I’m just not sure that’s accurate for my workflow.\n\nOVERALL: Great laptop, 2 in 1 functionality is awesome and feels really polished with Windows 11. Stone Blue color is also awesome and would recommend it!! 4.5/5 overall.",
  "Just got a Yoga 9i myself, also came from a MacBook. \n\nHaven't even had it for more than 24 hours yet, but so far, really can echo a lot of the points you made. Amazing screen, build quality, and speakers. The stylus support is an added bonus as I markup PDFs quite frequently for work.\n\nIf I had to pick a complaint, would be around battery and efficiency. It's not bad but not great either. Expected a bit more battery life and less heat/fan noise. Its early on, so hard to put a great gauge on it. \n\nGreat 2 in 1 all around though, pretty satisfied.",
  "Really nice to hear what you had to say. I just ordered the 14\".  I customized to go 16G RAM. My first (new) Lenovo.

  "Danke für deine Erfahrungen. Ich wünschte ich könnte auch die Erfahrungen über mein Geräte teilen aber dieses kam nie an und seitdem ärgere ich mich über den Kundendienst rum.\n\n**Meine Erfahrungen zum Lenovo-Service:**  \nIch habe vor über 8 Wochen bei Lenovo eine Bestellung aufgegeben, bestehend aus einer Laptop-Tasche und einem Tablet. Das Paket wurde zwar geliefert, jedoch war nur die Laptop-Tasche enthalten – das Tablet, das auf dem Lieferschein ebenfalls ausgewiesen war, fehlte.\n\nSeitdem habe ich mehrfach den Kundensupport kontaktiert, um das Problem zu klären, und wurde jedes Mal mit standardisierten Antworten abgespeist, die offensichtlich nicht auf meinen spezifischen Fall eingehen. Es wurde mir wiederholt geraten, bei Nachbarn nachzufragen, obwohl ich von Anfang an erklärt habe, dass das Paket bei mir angekommen ist, aber unvollständig war.\n\nNach wochenlangem Hin und Her bekam ich schließlich die Anweisung, einen Polizeibericht zu erstellen, damit eine Rückerstattung oder Ersatzlieferung erfolgen kann. Diese Forderung ist vollkommen unangemessen, da es sich hier nicht um einen Diebstahl oder Verlust handelt, sondern um ein Versäumnis seitens Lenovo.\n\nLaut geltendem Recht trägt der Verkäufer bei Verbrauchsgüterkäufen das Risiko für die Lieferung – es liegt also in der Verantwortung von Lenovo, die vollständige Lieferung der Ware sicherzustellen.\n\n**Fehlender Kundenservice:**\n\nDer Kundensupport scheint automatisierte Antworten zu geben, ohne auf den individuellen Fall einzugehen. Trotz klarer Schilderung des Problems wurde ich immer wieder mit unsinnigen Vorschlägen abgespeist.\n\n**Unangemessene Forderungen:**\n\nDie Forderung, dass ich als Kunde einen Polizeibericht erstellen soll, ist nicht nur rechtlich fragwürdig, sondern auch eine Zumutung. Es ist nicht meine Aufgabe, die Fehler von Lenovo zu korrigieren.\n\n**Verzögerungen:**\n\nSeit fast acht Wochen warte ich auf eine Lösung. Statt den Fehler umgehend zu beheben, werde ich mit bürokratischen Anforderungen hingehalten.\n\n**Mangelhafte Kommunikation:**\n\nEs gibt keinerlei proaktive Updates oder klare Lösungswege. Stattdessen muss ich als Kunde ständig nachhaken, nur um erneut enttäuscht zu werden.\n\n**Vertrauensverlust:**\n\nNach dieser Erfahrung bin ich nicht nur enttäuscht, sondern habe das Vertrauen in Lenovo als Unternehmen verloren. Ein solches Verhalten ist weder kundenorientiert noch akzeptabel für ein Unternehmen dieser Größe.\n\n**Fazit:**\n\nIch habe das Gerät vor 8 Wochen bezahlt und warte seitdem auf die Lieferung des Tablets oder eine Rückerstattung meines Geldes. Der Kundenservice gibt sein Bestes, mich immer wieder abzuwimmeln.\n\nDieser Umgang mit Kunden ist schlicht inakzeptabel.\n\nIch kann Lenovo nach dieser Erfahrung niemandem empfehlen und werde selbst in Zukunft keine Produkte mehr bei diesem Unternehmen kaufen.",

  "I have an 82yn and when the laptop is working it has been great. HOWEVER, mine has so many problems with it. I consitently run into driver issues with the touchpad and speakers. I have to constantly reinistall drivers mutliple times a day to ge the speakers working probably and for my touchpad to work at all. It fucking sucks. Also, Lenevo support fucking sucks. I sent the laptop to them all they did is factory reset my machine and then sent it back with exterior damage to the chasis. I have a very big dent on the front left of the laptop. I spent hours on support for them to finally say they were going to fix the damage for free and I had before and after pics, then they fucking blue balled me right at the end and said they were not doing it for free and going to charge me like 530 bucks to fix the chasis and hinge, which were both damaged in tranist or during the initial repair. This laptop could have been great but I will never be buying a lenovo product again.",

  "yes, they all are there, but the debloat apps exists and work to some extent.. if your workflow does not require windows, stick to mac. I have my Yoga 7i with every cell of my body. Absolute garbage in terms of battery life.",

  "And I'm curious about the battery, is it better?",
  "I got a 16” 2023 (2k screen 400nits, i7 1360p, 16 gb ram, 1tb ssd) because I found a great deal on it and I’ve been using it for a week. I just came back from the library after a 8 hour session (10 AM - 5:45 PM) and still had 25% battery by the end. I was running the screen around 75% of the screen brightness and had 2 desktops with 2 separate edge windows, 6-7 edge tabs open, MS word and OneNote. I run both the intelligent cooling mode on Vantage and balanced performance mode on windows but I do limit the maximum CPU in windows power plan to 50%. For my use case of note taking, browsing, writing papers it does not slow down or lags. Sorry for long review lol but I was trying to find an objective review before I bought it and I couldn’t find any, hope this helps tho. \n\nI love my 16” 2023, the pencil is a plus for me to take notes and screen is a beauty to use. I’m upgrading from a base 2020 M1 MBP, I sold it already and I also sold my 2020 iPad Pro since I can just carry around my Yoga 7i instead of both laptop and iPad.

So far I'm really loving mine this past few days, but then again I'm coming from an ancient machine hahaha  I just got open box for 200 so I'm leary if it has issues I just have not personally found yet.  For the price, I am going to ride it our regardless as it is in warranty, and most likely extend the warranty on it just to be sure because I really like it a lot.  I accidentally left it in the bag turned on in my car in blistering heat while I was at work and it survived that I guess lol",
  "I really loved the Flex - it was just used & buggy. After looking at a ton of reviews and videos & articles, I'm hearing that the  Yoga 9i is the cream of the crop. My fingers are crossed.\n\nMy *uneducated* wager would be on the Yoga 9i. I will try to come back and let you know when I get it (estimated to be on the 25th). But go over and look at both. When looking at specs, you can go all the way to the bottom and there will be a link for \"full specs\" for whichever build number you are considering.

  "Yes it's the 2 in 1 convertible. Hinge has been fine and absolutely no issues, it is sturdy and doesn't wobble a lot. \n\nNothing new to report, just that battery has been consistent to about 7-8 hours each day and that is more than enough for me to go to class, take notes and then review at the library until 6 PM. It's a little heavier than my old 13\" M1 MBP and the battery does not last nearly as long that (I would need to charge it every other day - newer MacBook laptops are crazy for battery life), but the bigger screen, the USB-A ports, nicer keyboard and pen support is what makes it 100% worth it for me. And also for a fraction of the price for the Apple equivalent.",

  "Mainly for engineering. For CAD, circuits, etc.\n\nUpdate since I can’t update the post. I am waiting on this laptop to be in stock. The Lenovo P1Gen8. They say it’ll have the new RTX Pro Blackwell 2000. It will also have the latest new cpu. So I’m gonna wait.",
  "I feel like that legion 5 is overpriced for those specs\nFor that price range i am pretty sure you can get a 5070 or 4080 laptop",
  "These are all sucky deals. Your college bookstore is making massive margins off you. Looks for RTX5070 laptop on Bestbuy, any of those would drastically out perform all of these for as much as $1000 less.",
  "Tell me this is CAD please",
  "Thinkpad.",
  "Gaming always, Lenovo",
  "What are you using it for?\nGaming get the legion. Thinkpad for work.",
  "As soon as you take these home they are worth 1$ tops, so why not just buy a nice used one?",
  "Picture one. Seriously when it comes to laptop just look at the ram and the gpus vram and then the price the other two laptops are blatant rip offs",
  "Omg is this Wolfpack outfitters???? Maybe other colleges are using the same descriptions but I literally see these in the bookstore. The P1 G7 is really light but will also work good for the CAD necessary for engineering. The legions are really heavy, I got one and never take it anywhere bc it is heavy. The P1 is probably the most portable. See if you can find it cheaper online, Lenovo has awesome student discounts and you can usually negotiate cart threshold discounts as well with customer service online.",
  "I wouldn’t buy any of these with my own money for CAD apps specifically but if someone’s giving me one I’d take the 4060 and put at least 32 GB RAM in it. Wouldn’t touch the ADA 1000, 2000 is a little worse than the 4060 but would have enterprise support.",
  "Overpriced af",
  "Expensive",
  "Black Friday sales are coming deals and discounts are pretty good if you can wait.",
  "Check lenovo education website, they have good deals on last year's model as well! Then you'll get more value and I've only had good experiences with their online store.",
  "I would go with Thinkpad P1. Legions are turned for gaming and I never like Dell laptops. P1 is designed for engineering tasks and I think they have some certifications to make sure that CAD applications could run on them smoothly.",
  "Thinkpad or the legion but i highly suggest you buy a used Thinkpad p1 the prices are a quarter of what they are new, companies throw these out as soon as their out of warranty so most of them are in good condition",
  "i have a legion 5 and i hate hate hate the trackpad placement...it's too far to the left and the pad on my thumb is constantly throwing my cursor off.  i've used a dell precision and it was a beast.  never used a thinkpad, but i've never heard bad things about them.  just based on personal experience, i'd go with the dell.",
  "dell. still a bad deal tho if in usd.",
  "Don't buy any of them. You should be able to get at least 12gb gpu ram and a bigger SSD, more system ram, better CPU, etc. For that price. My Lenovo was $1900 and it has a rtx 5700ti and a core ultra i9 275hx. Bought it from lenovos site.",
  "Dell is probably the best of the lot. 9 series, 32 gig ram, nice gpu. What's the use case tho?",
  "U can get way cheaper price on all of these laptops elsewhere",
  "If you are spending 2.5k on a laptop, there are so many better options.  If you want raw performance, get a gaming laptop like a 5080 omen max. if you want portability and performance, get something like the ASUS zephyrus G16 5070Ti. Both of those options are considerably cheaper and have much better screens and performance.",
  "Personally, i would buy the dell, but then i would rather maintain a type writer than own a Lenovo.. \n\nBefore everyone jumps on me for that comment, the early think pads when they were IBM were burning down houses, and now.. \n\nThe post covid machines are absolute hot garbage.. They stopped manufacturing their own drivers. Which means you have to use the windows update to update drivers, the issue is selective sleep and bios updates. The EPA created the requirement for selective sleep, so no disabling it. The Selective sleep causes the daughter card in the Lenovo to disable charging, this causes the stupid machine to die in the middle of bios updates, which bricks the firmware. \n\nLast year i replaced over 300 Lenovo's, due to this nightmare issue.. Lenovo's fix.. \"This is a Microsoft issue\" and Microsoft \"this is a Lenovo issue\"",
  "The dell is a better spec’d rig for sure, and the precisions are well built in my opinion. The Thinkpad is good, but at the same price, the dell beats it, especially with 2gb more vram and the better processor. As much as I dig Lenovo’s build quality, the Dell wins this one on price/spec out of the choices here.",
  "I wouldn't take any of these. Premium segment prices and serious issues\n\n1) very old CPU\n2) 1 gen old CPU and awful screen\n3) 1 gen old CPU and truly atrocious screen in that price category",
  "Wow, prices have gone up significantly. I paid $1560 for a legion pro 5 with the i9 and rtx4070 two years ago...",
  "“model will be in-store in june 2025” looks like they’re a bit late. but for your use case i’d go w the dell, i’d first check other places. those prices are insanely terrible. that legion (16irx9 83DG009SUS)  is from last year and is from their previous generation. when it was brand new it costed $2150 usd. given that they’re only selling gen 10 models, there’s no way that that should be as expensive as it is. you can spend literally half the price and get a gen 10 legion 5 with the same graphics, storage, and memory except with a slightly worse processor, a 15” screen instead of 16”, and an OLED panel of the same refresh rate and higher brightness.",
  "Best for what?\n\nYou are trying to compare a gaming laptop with 2 business laptops.",
  "What are you using it for?",
  "2nd and 3rd have ai workstation GPUs. not ideal for gaming. but for productivity. \n\n1st is a gaming laptop.",
  "What's your budget? None of those specs are good",
  "Are you in the US?\n\nIf so, those prices are more than double what you should be paying.",
  "ThinkPad",
  "Based on the comments I have seen most people are assuming that you are going to be using it for gaming. If you are then go with the legion. If you need it for intensive workloads go with the Dell. If you have a desktop for heavy loads and just need decent battery and high reliability/repairability, go with the thinkpad. Other things to look at are how well they are documented by manufacturers and how much support they provide. If you go with the thinkpad, they have decent support from my experience and if they can’t help then you are almost guaranteed an answer from r/thinkpad",
  "Lenovo legion. (Next contestant please)",
  "Legion. Lesser cost, better graphics, great durability and experience. Might be bit heavy",
  "They all suck",
  "How's a 4060 being sold at this price?",
  "I notice this is from a campus school store. If you aren’t using financial aid or student loans to get these, I would say don’t buy from them and go to a bestbuy. You can get this years models for much less.",
  "I have the dell from work, as a replacement for a hp z. More compact frame and lighter than the hp which is a plus. Only 2 USB c ports both on the left, one of which is the power jack, so if you have  multiple USB accessories it's a pain. The paint layer on the dell chassis is very thin. Scratched very easily, the first time I observed this on a laptop and I have used lenovos, hp and MacBooks. The fan is noisy. Keyboard feels good better than the hp. Hate the trackpad though. The click sections on the trackpad are at the bottom instead of the top which is horrible design per my preference.",

  "Please tell me this is not USD",
  "If this selection is actually from you bookstore.. NONE. What the actual heck are you thinking dude? That Thinkpad should be $1700 Canadian max",
  "The one that says RTX, you'll worry about ram later",
  "These laptops are ridiculously overpriced",
  "ThinkPad since you say engineering. The legion's battery life will be bad since its a gaming laptop and the gpu consumes more power than my electricity guzzling laptop. If you want to do some gaming on the side, thinkpad is likely not optimized for gaming but the specs don't look terrible for competitive/older titles",
  "Def not legion. Get the precision 100% the rtx 2000 ada is a beast",
  "Legion 5 just because it has the RTX 4080 which will be pretty great for gaming., I have the desktop version and it's a beast.  But honestly... they are all terrible for that price. If you're gonna be using it for work/school and no gaming then probably the Dell.",

If I where doing no upgrades the second one- If I only needed a screen to read text all day and didn't use multiple ram hungry applications the first one. If I could upgrade both machines I'd choose the first one because a great screen is a godsend for your eyes. I would look on Amazon for refurbished models - I often buy them for clients and they have been brand new so far. At the end of day I would always buy the thinkpad but when shopping make sure you buy one with replaceable RAM , not all do-- my X1 carbon does not.",
  "If I was limited to the 3 only, and only those 3, I would choose the 14650hx with the 4060, unless you need the more VRAM for LLMs or just pure graphical power for other than gaming or cuda needs.

Most replacement parts are easy to get through their website, Based on my personal experience repairing dozens of them, it's also fairly easy to upgrade the RAM and SSD. Also Lenovo's ThinkPad series in general is preferred in high cybersecurity environments because of their resistance to certain kinds of hardware based attacks. I've seen them in police departments and boardrooms.",
  "What kind of engineering",
  "When I run heavy science computations, for example finite element models or dimensionality reductions on large datasets, the limiting factor is always the RAM. These are all relatively low RAM. \n\nOn the other hand, science software including FEM is so far not designed to take advantage of the GPU. \n\nSo these computers are simultaneously more expensive than needed, and not very powerful for the sake of engineering computations imo. \n\nI'd max the RAM, pick a fairly good CPU, and save on graphics and other bells and whistles.",
  "What workloads will you be using?",
  "I feel like you could find this so much cheaper if you find the exact model in an open box or used atleast, these prices are astronomical and they depreciate the moment you own it 💔",
  "All of these are way overkill for most kinds of engineering, what kind are you doing? I run aerospace CAD on huge assemblies on something that probably cost half of this.\n\nIf you want to game as well I'd used the savings to buy an xbox or PlayStation, unless you insist on mobile gaming",

  "Damn, you are spot on with the location. Yes it is wolfpack outfitters. Also my job is paying for the laptop any amount here for free for me. Hence why I need to get it here.",
  "Ahhh for what they do they are not overpriced. It is standard price. They are technically made for intensive task that professionals use like autodesk, photoshop, CAD, circuits, etc. make it run fast and smooth not met for gaming. Except for the legion, which is met for gaming .",
  "MacBook sucks ass for engineering, and I don’t have time to game. Even though I already have the switch 2.",
  "I disagree, for engineering no. These laptops are pretty standard price for what they offer to people in the engineering field. We don’t care about the bells and whistles we want raw performance. To make CAD, Autodesk, circuits work fast and efficiently. Even using AI.",
  "This 100%",
  "Vs code🥀",
  "Why buy a console? If you're already paying for a new laptop just pay for a better one instead of a just fine one and a console",

  "But one is gaming other is enterprise grade",
  "Just o offer a counterpoint: I have had a Legion 5i for about 5 years now, and it's worked perfectly for me all the years. Decent Battery, no problems with performance (don't know about any special programs you might need it for for engineering, but since it's rated to run most AAA games it should be fine i guess).\n\nOnly recently has the screen started to malfunction in the lower 10%, i guess from tiny bends in the lid.\n\nAnd portability isn't the best, but that was to be expected.\n\nNo problems with trackpad placing here.",
  "Horrible for engineering. No support for solidworks (unless you use cloud but even then thats just ass) cant run any simulation programs like ansys, catia, etc or using creo. Would be great if he was graphic design running adobe tho. if an engineer NEVER BUY APPLE! (nothing against apple just lacks major compatibility with engineering software)",
  "because if they need high-performance rendering, they will want a 50-series card for the best possible times. Also an m5 max macbook will be CONSIDERABLY more expensive than $2500 factoring in the price to upgrade to a decent amount of RAM and storage",
  "Honestly I think they make better feeling hardware, they just feel built well, and outside of this issue, they were decent machines, but this is a big issue in a business scenario and really annoying if you use a docking station.. Since that same daughter card and sleep BS causes the stupid docking station to randomly disconnect and reconnect..",
  "Then pretty much any of those will do I think.",
  "yes that has better gpu and cpu for your engineering stuff.",
  "You should really look somewhere else, that's a 5080 price category",
  "Understood. Dell easily unless you’re working heavily with assemblies and simulations, in which case the Legion would be slightly better. Good luck!",
  "Oh my bad you're right... It is a 4060. Still is a pretty solid GPU.",
  "Why does that matter  unless the OP wants a gaming laptop.",
  "The guy im about to buy in store said they are coming out with the new thinkpad Lenovo with Blackwell Nvidia RTX 2000 with same CPU. What do you think?",
  "It's a \"gaming laptop\" so automatically inferior",
  "Ohhh okay well like I said the p1 is light. Most engineering students I’ve met so far have that laptop and love it. It’s very portable. Sometimes the bookstore sells a 3299 thinkpad that is an absolute beast.",
  "Kinda depends on the engineering, lol.",
  "User issue. ",
  "The m4 pro multicore is faster than all of those and the gpu isn’t bad either. The only problem you could have is macOS and arm, Most of the Autodesk suite works natively on arm. All i am saying is just consider it. Altium doesn’t run natively though.",
  "1 tab of chrome",
  "Why must you hurt me in this way",
  "Also the new Xbox coming out will have windows. And like 1200. So its a pc... Definitely buy a standalone Pc/laptop. 🙂",
  "A local shop in Syria.",
  "Get the Dell.",
  "It's not the laptop's fault that you chose to use something that's deprecated?",
  "Eh. I don't see the point of purchasing a high end laptop solely for its GPU. If I did it would be for a PC.",
  "Right. I love my Lenovo IdeaPad and it was way ahead of its time like 7 years ago. i7, 16 GB RAM, 256 SSD and 1TB storage drive, SDHC slot, good built in speakers, black brushed aluminum cover... This thing is solid many years later. I have dropped it down the stairs, left it in a hot car in Florida for a few days, ETC... This thing won't quit on me. It's my work PC now.",
  "Definitely, would choose legion cuz its cheaper",
  "The 2000 Blackwell is midway through a 5050m and 5060m, it’s better than all of the choices in the post so why not if it’s at the same price. The currency is what ? USD, CAD, AUD ?",

  "how does that make any sense? the cpu and gpu in the legion is objectively better than the thinkpad. just because it’s advertised for gaming doesn’t automatically somehow make it worse",
  "I saw that one but was like no. I need portable laptops not a machine 😂 They had a $2999 but they sold out. He told me if I can wait I will get the RTX Maxwell 8GB ada GPU. With an upgraded cpu. So I was like might as wait for a bit",

  "if they want the 'best' laptop for their \\~$2500 budget, I am going to reccommend the laptops that have the best components.  Both are also considerably less than their budget.

  "USD keep in mind I’m not paying for this. My company is and they are the ones that said it must be from this store.",
  "It is worse though. Try to travel with a gaming laptop and see how much the build quality and battery life matter, also see for yourself how much a better brighter screen is needed. Also when the board dies for no reason at all you will understand why those enterprise laptops just cost more",
  "If I had 800 dollars I would buy a MacBook m4 air. It has about twice the CPU throughput of the slim",
  "Nope I can't imagine that I would. I have to get a Windows 11 machine for work soon so I'm really dreading it. Got any recommendations? I just need a good processor and 16-32 GB of RAM. I have a separate gaming rig so the laptop will be only for work",
  "Oh, definitely p series lenovo, if its dedicated to work only",
  "What a fucking rip off, I’ve seen better deals at a Disneyland park. If the RTX 2000 Blackwell is the same price as the Dell or a tiny bit more get that then, also depends on the laptop, will it be a Thinkpad P1 or else ?",
  "build quality of my machine is more than fine, an aluminum chassis can hold up against regular use. my 500 nits panel is no HDR1000 but is more than fine and brighter than most displays. cleaning your internals\\fans once every couple months and monitoring temps like you would with any high-performance computer can prevent potential internal faults. idk why u think “gaming” laptops are so much worse. if we are speaking anecdotally, a professor of mine’s thinkpad died “for no reason” just a couple weeks ago, so enterprise laptops definitely aren’t immune to what you speak of",
  "engineering CAD stuff is generally specialised and might not run on MacOS, my point was that some laptops don't meet the brief.",
  "Unless you spend a lot of moolahs, nope",
  "Yes it’ll be a think pad P1Gen8. Will have the new cpu and the RTX Pro Maxwell or Blackwell 2000? It’s one of those but it’s a brand new GPU.",
  "Thought so. I'm just gonna tell my job I can't afford it at this time.",
  "It’s going to be Blackwell, Maxwell was used 10 years ago. Unless they decided to pair a 285H with an MX450. As a general rule of thumb for professional GPUs never go with the 1000 or below version, consider 2000 the bare minimum/budget, 3000 mid range (can give you some benefits from here like improved cooling on Zbooks) and above you’re getting in high and highest end territory.\n\nYeah get that then, those are the only options in the store or anything else Blackwell or Zbook Fury ? While they’re pricy if you’re not paying for it might aswell get something good",
  "Which stick of RAM is compatible with the Lenovo Thinkbook 15 Gen 3 (AMD)? I found both of these RAM sticks on the Crucial website, and both say that they are compatible.\nIs this true?",
  "First of all, these are M.2 SSDs and not RAM.\n\nSecond, any should work. You should have a 2280 slot.",
  "Those are SSD drives and if your device doesn't support gen 4 SSD drives then the other is better overall so you're not wasting the speed it offers",

  "What are you planning to use it for? A secondary storage? They're fine.\n\nBut for boot drive? The P3 isn't recommended, because it's DRAM less. I'd lean more towards T500.\n\nBut you should look at your laptop's supported PCIE gen, if it's only gen3 then you'll be limited to gen3 speeds even when you use gen4 sticks (don't worry, they're backwards compatible).",

  "I use it for my college classes, and I plan to use it for some gaming on the side too. I see that it supports Gen 3 SSD only, so I don't think I can use the T500. Do you have any other recommendations for Gen 3 SSD sticks?",

  "Got it, thanks.",
  "ADATA XPG SX8200, Samsung 970 Evo Plus.\n\nYou can use the T500 or any other gen4 and gen5 sticks just fine, it's just that their speed will be limited to gen3 speeds. So it's more of a \"you don't get the performance you're paying for\".",
  "You cooked nothing",
  "Makes perfect sense to me!",
  "Perfect, thanks!",
  "You can always refer to Tom's Hardware reviews to check whether the SSD you're looking for (outside from the two I've mentioned) does have a DRAM or not. They have you covered for that specific info. 👍\n\nMake sure the TBW rating is reasonable too, don't pick those that have low TBW rating (like for example 4 TB size, 900 TBW. Or 2 TB size, 480 TBW. 1 TB size, 320 TBW. Those are quite low). \n\nNVMEs with lower TBW rating for their capacity tend to be more apparent on DRAM less SSDs though, and sketchy brands often not mentioning anything about the TBW rating aside from their sequential speed.",
  "I appreciate the information, will do.",
  "Ah one more thing I forgot to mention, because it's an issue on my laptop because I didn't make sure of it first.\n\nMake sure whether your laptop's M.2 socket can fit a double-sided SSD or can only fit a single-sided stick. As far as I know, for 2TB size, only Samsung that have single-sided sticks (they use 1TB NAND chips each to make it possible). There's still plenty of single-sided choices though for 1TB size. Make sure you ask the seller or look for reviews for that specific size. \n\nOn my current laptop (HP Omen16 2021), I have 2 slots, but only one slot that can fit double-sided NVMe. The other one can only fit single-sided sticks since the bottom of the socket has a piece of metal that connects directly to the cooling system to actively help cooling the NVME. On the other hand, my older laptop (MSI P65 Prestige), have two sockets as well but both sockets support double-sided sticks.",

  "I would say it really depends on your use case. I would go for the mac if you want to do video editing or music/ design work, for the better display (probably). \nIf you want CPU performance, I would go for the ThinkPad, as it will have better cooling. I believe the ThinkPad also has a newer processor, by one generation. Geneally the ThinkPad will be more repairable and replacement parts will be cheape. It also has more ports. \n\n\nIf you have an iPhone, the mac will integrate nicely, less so the ThinkPad as things like handoff, air drop and messages on the lapop won't work nearly as flawless.",
