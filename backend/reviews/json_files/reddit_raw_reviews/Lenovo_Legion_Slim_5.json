  "Which Laptop Should I Pick? Lenovo Legion Slim 5 OR HP Zbook Firefly G11 I'm a mechanical engineering student looking for a 14inch laptop for college for around 1000$. my two picks right now are either the HP Zbook Firefly g11 or the Lenovo Legion Slim 5. The legion is a refurbished laptop off of lenovo outlet.\n\nI'm concerned about the firefly because there are very mixed reviews, and some say it has good battery life and performance, others dont. I'd be getting the version with the intel ultra 5-135H and dedicated nvidia A500 GPU. I want this to be enough to do some light gaming and use CAD and simulation software for engineering. I like this laptop because it is very slim and professional. I just hope the battery life is good. \n\nOn the other hand, I love everything about the legion's performance and battery life (it has an AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS Processor and a nvidia 4060), but i am only slightly concerned about it being refurbished, and I also don't want it to stick out as a \"gaming\" laptop. It seems pretty slim but I cant tell how it will look in person. Any suggestions?",
  "The Legion Slim 5, hands down. I actually bought a refurbished one from this eBay seller: https://ebay.us/Jpwgit and it’s been good, no issues so far. The performance is amazing for the price, especially for CAD and light gaming. It doesn’t look too gamer-y either, just a bit thicker than ultrabooks but still clean-looking. #ad",
  "I also looked at the ACER Swift x 14, but i dont like that it has horrible fan noise",
  "Big difference in graphic card performance in favor of the legion slim. H series draw more power than HS processors so battery life will be affected. Look up the TDP of both processors to check. Gaming laptop stigma isnt really a thing in undergrad unless it is loud/has obnoxious lighting. People will respect it if you are an engineering student with a gaming laptop vs a history major with a gaming laptop. Rgb could make you popular at parties in the dark though.",
  "Manufacturer wise, Lenovo is hands down better than HP",
  "TDP stands for **thermal design power**, and for the Zbook it is only 57W",
  "ASUS TUF A15, Lenovo LOQ 15 or Lenovo Legion Slim 5 with slightly lower specs? I’m an architecture student, I want a budget-friendly gaming laptop that is strong for renders and 3D softwares, also I don’t own a PS5 or a next-gen gaming console, which might be the case for a long while, so I want a laptop that also performs well in games. I currently have 3 options that I cannot decide between:\n\n1-ASUS TUF A15 Ryzen 7 7735hs RTX 4060 8gb VRAM 1080p 144hz\n\n2-Lenovo LOQ 15 intel i7 13620h RTX 4060 8gb 1080p 144hz\n\n3-Lenovo Legion Slim 5 intel i7 13700h RTX 4050 6gb VRAM 2K display 165hz\n\nThe ASUS is the cheapest, with both the LOQ and the Legion being equally priced. I went to a store and asked one of the workers there about the ASUS and told me so many good stuff about it compared to the LOQ, such as the cooling system and build quality, but watching reviews on this model of ASUS, all comments on it are kinda mixed which makes me scared of getting it, I’m more convinced about getting the LOQ because I heard it has a better display which is something that strongly matters to me. \n\nAs for the Legion, I heard that it’s the BEST budget gaming laptop there is, though considering that it’s gpu is 4050 instead of 4060, it makes me scared of regretting my purchase, since 4060 is significantly better than the 4050.\n\nSorry for all of this text, but I would love some advice, if it is based on personal experience that would be a lot better, but all suggestions are welcome, thanks! :))\n\n",
  "I'd do the LOQ or the Legion in your scenario. I know they're promising to be better but the ASUS support stories still scare the shit out of me. I really wouldn't trust in-store workers on anything, they're just trying to sell you stuff. \n\nMeanwhile I've used Lenovo support multiple times for repairs and full part replacements without problems. The 4060 will be way, way better than the 4050, so the LOQ is the best bang for your buck. I have an LOQ with a 7840HS and a mobile 4060 and it's basically my workstation now as well - it plays all games at high/ultra and doesn't have any problems. Had this for almost a year now with no problems.",
  "Thank you for the suggestion! I’ve been thinking about getting the LOQ too, but I haven’t heard great stuff about the thermals and the build quality. Does the build quality feel cheap? Or is it durable enough? And is the cooling good when playing games?",
  "Is this laptop worth 1049.99? ",
  "I would presume so",
  "100%",
  "Yes, very reputable brand too (don't worry about the number of reviews)",
  "Yeah.  \nKnown brand with good hinges, damn beautiful, great components too.  \nIt's OLED too.  \nI'd buy it for sure.  \n\nOP, I think you're either wasting our time or wasting your money, to say so as nicely as possible.  \nThis laptop is everything you need and want at 1k$.  \nYou want RGB? FINE! Get some laptop with worse specs that's marketed \"for gaming\" and see it suck in games.  \nThis one is good for years if you do proper maintenance.(Just like any other laptop).",
  "Yes",
  "i recently bought the legion pro 5i, all those specs except less storage, no oled and it’s 16in. it has 4 zone rgb. It’s an incredible laptop. imo the legion line has the best laptops for its price, honestly i would pay more for it. i’m LOVING it, the gaming performance is impressive. i also thought it looked boring when i saw it online but in person it looks great. My screen isn’t OLED like the version you posted and i still think it’s fantastic. LOVE that most ports are at the back and not the side. just a well designed and powerful laptop, i would highly recommend.",
  "Sorry guys, its 1049.99 US dollars",
  "If it’s usd, seems like a good deal",
  "Yeah that's pretty good.",
  "It's decent, do some looking around to compare price to other websites",
  "Probably would need to upgrade the RAM tho",
  "No",
  "my laptop had a 3060, same cpu and bettet screen and cost 500 more",
  "Specs like this are worth double that in most places of the world so if you question is is it worth buying, then the answer is yes",
  "Looks a decent laptop at that price. Go ahead and buy it if you like it. Number of reviews don't really mean anything. If you're still on the fence, just look it up on YouTube",
  "Do you guys know when is the best time for a laptop discount? Are there specific day for discount?",
  "yolo",
  "Decent",
  "My friend just bought this, definitely worth the money + the screen is beautiful",
  "1049.99 of what currency?",
  "Kinda meh, you can get basically the same thing for 800 usually if you look for a good deal",
  "I have a 17” legion with a 3060. Things been great to me for the last few years!",
  "The screen and the specs look good. I would try the touchpad and decide. \n\nCheap plastic touchpads are a NO GO on expensive laptops. Or the other way around: I don’t understand why the majority Windows machines continue to try to copy Apple with cheap plastic touchpads and still put outrageous price tags.",
  "I have that laptop, it's worth it and i bought it for $1250",
  " Go for it !! Or zephyrus g14 is also the option !! It has offers going on time to time on bestbuy",
  "yeah its good for the price",
  "My dad got a laptop with worst specs for 1500 :(",
  "Here is your stupid question of the day: If a laptop is excellent at gaming can I assume it is excellent at non gaming, just business stuff? Or is a gaming laptop just built for gaming and actually doesn't handle Excel and Teams very well?",
  "Its ok",
  "Going off of what I know with the legion brand, I would only say it depends if it's a metal casing or plastic casing.\n\nPlastic casing from my experience just feels cheaper and easier to break. The metal will give a premium feel.",
  "This is in all possibility, really really good. I remember paying similar amount for i7 8th gen 8GB RAM, 128 GB SSD, 1 TB HDD, 4GB 1080 Ti. This was in 2019 though.",
  "yes ofc",
  "hell yeah. I bought a laptop with an i7-10750H and 3060 6gb in 2021 for like 1800$. I'd be more than happy to upgrade to that(ofc I won't cuz I don't have 1050$)",
  "Good deal!!",
  "It is but I’d still always recommend buying with a warranty. And having it shipped to a local store before picking it up. Like ordering from Best Buy then having them do the set up. (They will catch any problems before you bring it home).",
  "100%",
  "Godlike CPU\n\nMeh GPU\n\nEntry level RAM capacity\n\n🤡 🤡 🤡 🤡 🤡",
  "Lots of people answering that it's worth it but none of them have a clue which CURRENCY you use in your country... this might be Roubles or Yen or Hong Kong Dollars for all we know.",

  "Do you have any other laptop suggestions? This one only have 100ish people reviews, i am kind scared",
  "second this",
  "This one doesnt look that cool, no rgb light and that kinda stuff, do you know any laptop thats cool , same quality (a bit more expensive is acceptable)",
  "Thank you and sorry man, i got scammed multiple times, spending lots of money to get something really bad, i dont want to experience this again, mb",
  "Do you have any other laptop suggestions? This one only have 100ish people reviews, i am kind scared",
  "Can you send the link",
  "Sorry, but what is usd",
  "It’s not when it was 799 before",
  "Do you know any fancy one? This one have no rgb and cool stuff",
  "Sadly, the RAM is soldered in. But you can buy a 32GB ram model from Lenovo's website directly. Unfortunately, its $1620 right now for 32GB ram + 1TB SSD.  I don't how often Lenovo does sales but I managed to nab the 32GB RAM 1TB model for under $1300",
  "You can't, it's soldered to the board.\n\nOnly problem with these slim laptops.",
  "16GB is good enough",
  "Can i ask why",
  "Can you send me a link to the laptop",
  "[deleted]",
  "Alr bro, everyone is saying this laptop worth it, im getting it:))",
  "Thank you bro, everyone is saying its pretty good, im getting it:)",
  "USD",
  "No you can't.. Not with an oled and a 4060. This screen is downright beautiful and worth a little extra.",
  "Gaming laptop means good specs that can handle everything, it can handle both business and gaming",
  "[removed]",
  "Us dollars",
  "Dollars",
  "wtf",
  "Bro what? 😂 Idk if there are any mainstream laptop rtx 3050 mods that doubles its vram. I’m sure Lenovo doesn’t do it.",
  "100 reviews is more than enough for a laptop",
  "It only recently began being sold, so it's normal that there aren't 1000+ reviews on the product.  Lenovo make some of the best gaming laptops, I'm sure this one would perform just fine.",
  "I think it should be great",
  "It's a Lenovo, you're good.  Just don't get a HP or MSI.",
  "For gaming zephyrus g14",
  "you can get the zephyrus g14 but i would honestly opt for this one, lenovo legion has a good reputation. The price is okay too",
  "You have wrong prorities my friend, rgb isn't important, it's the parts inside that are, like what cpu, GPU and ram and stuff, but it's your money so you do you.",
  "Check out dave2d youtube channel, most of his reviews are gaming laptops of all price ranges. You are best off shopping for slightly older models on big discounts from retailers like bestbuy, they always have good devices on sale",
  "I meaannnn literally anything other than razer blade has shitty rgb no?",
  "There is Asus tuf series but lenevo has better build quality and temps so just go with the lenevo",
  "I understand, but if you want RGB you'll likely get scammed. You'll get scammed by thinking it's still worth the price, when this one is worth 1k$, it's the definition of a 1k$ laptop if you ask me.  \nBest damn thing at this price.  \nNow, with this specs, I must ask, are you looking for a gaming LAPTOP, or a PC?  \nThe laptop is underpowered compared to the PC because of the thermals and battery, but the PC lacks much of the portability.  \nGet a laptop if you need it to be portable, not if it's like the 5th criteria on your list.",
  "I own this laptop . Overall, it's great that even Youtuber Jared's Tech also named it the best 14-inch gaming laptop of 2023 . The display is beautiful, the performance is great, and the downside is soldered ram and mediocre speakers\n\nThe other option i considered was the G14 2023 with 4060 and the G16 2023 4060 they were around 1100 ish after taxes",
  "as the guy said the one you posted is better than mine! once you don’t mind a smaller screen and no rgb like mine, get it.",
  "Get the one you posted it's way better.",
  "US Dollars",
  "Wait a minute, it was 799 before?",
  "I've never seen this one 799. I think you're talking about a different model.",
  "its ur money so its ur choice 100% but if youre going for a laptop I think rgb should be last of ur worries.",
  "You'd probably have to either pay more or start compromising on actual specs.",
  "Ah right, I forgot that this is the slim version. My bad.",
  "the 16” version is not soldered",
  "For a short while, yes. Not in the long run though.",
  "not sure if its on sale anymore. ill check anyway and find out",
  "ROG STRIX SCAR G15 Electro Punk",
  "wow! thanks for pointing that out! i really didnt know! 🤩🤩",
  "Also you'll love the oled screen",
  "I've seen OLED g14 go to 800, as well as gigabyte aero OLED go to like 900. Both with 4060",
  "Are you saying that business applications will use more battery than gaming ?",
  "WHICH COUNTRY?! Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, USA, and numerous other countries use Dollars, ALL with different values...",
  "Why is that, made me curious",
  "I have a laptop with a 3050ti with 12 gigs of vram",
  "You convinced me, and do you think this is worth it? I play lots of games though, including 3A.",
  "Also, do you guys know if theres like a day for laptop discount or something like that, ehen is the best time to buy laptop",
  "This one only have less than 200 reviews, im kind concerning",
  "Some Lenovo has nice red lighting with a custom bios that makes rgb available on all keys.",
  "[removed]",
  "US dollars, my bad",
  "Most people will assume US dollars when you say dollars especially since a majority of redditors are based in the US.  No need to be so aggressive damn",
  "I have no idea what that person is talking about. Also yes the Slim 14inch is a steal at that price.",
  "It is a good purchase. Buy it.",
  "3050 is not even comparable to a 4060.. he's just saying nonsense.",
  "a 3050 is not good compared to a 4060",
  "Honestly, I think it could handle everything, maybe not at MAX settings, but at good ones and also reviews don't always mean anything, just because something doesn't have a ton of reviews doesn't mean it sucks,just means not that many like to write reviews or that many people haven't found this laptop yet and people also buy such laptops on other sites as well.",
  "considering laptops often get like 20 reviews, its fine",
  "Gotcha.",
  "OK thank you. Have a good day.",
  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

  "$500 laptop for school? I need to buy a new laptop for school. My budget is only $500, absolutely no higher.\nI don’t need to be able to game on it, I already have a gaming PC and Lenovo Legion Go lol\n\nHowever, I’m a Mechanical Engineering major so I’ll need to be able to run some heavier software like CAD, MATLAB, other simulation tools, etc.\n\nPortability is also a factor because I’ll be taking it back and forth to work with me every day to do coursework in my downtime.\n\nThe only options I can find near me are the ASUS Vivobook with Intel Core 5 120U and the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U. \nBased on reviews online, and especially on a Reddit, I’m scared to pull the trigger on either one now.\n\nIs there a better option that I haven’t found yet?",
  "have you considered a used buissness laptop?",
  "Used/old business laptop is the way to go smth with a i5/i7 11th-12th gen if you need the extra graphics power go for the i7 but i will run a little hotter than the i5",

  "Hard time choosing a new laptop. So I currently am using a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, and am planning on upgrading because: A) It is not powerful enough, and B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nI am a student and will primarily be using the laptop for school work, so it needs to be portable and a comfortable weight to bring with me to and from class. I love how portable my 13\" Air is. I've done a LOT of research over the past two years, but never bit the bullet, but I feel like now is the time, and so I've committed to buying one now.\n\nMy use cases (in order of importance): School, Music Production, Photoshop, Gaming\n\nI don't play a lot of games but it would be nice to have a machine to play some Civ 6 or even some other, more intensive games like BO2/BO3 Zombies (and MAYBEEEE some RDR2) when I am on a plane for a long time. I want something that's decent on battery life, I don't spend all day at school, maybe 4 hours at most on a given day, so I want something that'll last me that long doing just school work without having to even worry about bringing a charger.\n\nNow, I've looked at like tens of laptops, from gaming to notebook, and I've seen some I've considered like the Zenbook S16, Lenovo Slim 7i Aura, Zenbook 14, Zenbook A14, but I've narrowed it down to a couple:\n\nZephyrus G14/G16 - The clear winner for me, problem is it is just too expensive, and the only models that go on sale into my price range are the 4050 G14 and 4060 G16 models which I've heard may not be worth it. They don't go on sale super often, and the ones that do are open box. (Currently can get the 4050 model for $1499 CAD open box)\n\nZenbook Duo 2024 (Ultra 9, 32GB, 1TB, 60hz 1080p model) - I've toyed with the idea of having this laptop for a while. My PC setup at home has 3 monitors and I absolutely love it, and could see myself getting genuine use out of both screens when writing an assignment, key word being WHEN I am doing an assignment, which isn't an every day thing. I don't think it would be powerful enough to handle any gaming at all. Surprisingly, this is actually cheaper than both the G14 and G16 Models I would be getting. (Currently can get it Refurb-Excellent for $1519 CAD)\n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 15\" - This just came out, and I feel like 15\" is the perfect size for me to be honest. I can get the spec with the Ryzen 7 260, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD (will add another in the future), and a 5060 8GB card for within my price range, around $1750 all in. It's around 4 pounds which is the heaviest of the three, but is also the fastest of the three. It's so new that there isn't a single review yet for it. (Brand new for $1750 CAD, could try and haggle it at Lenovo)\n\nThese are my three ideas right now in terms of what to get. Does anyone have any recommendations? Anyone with these laptops have advice?\n\nI'd not like to spend more than $2000 CAD.\n\nEDIT: In case it wasn't clear, this is not meant to be a desktop replacement; I already have one.",
  "Well you need to be aware of the fact that most gaming laptops have a dedicated gpu they are loud heavy and the battery life is 3hours at best and the performance is ass when on battery .\nSo you’ll want something with a powerful igpu like a Ryzen ai 300 series (the Ryzen 7 or 9 models) or the intel core ultra 200 series ( like the ultra 7 258v) these have the most powerful iGPUs currently available. Also their batter life is pretty good.",
  "Don't buy the Zenbook duo. It's more of a gimmick and not a good choice for your use case. \n\nGaming laptops all suffer from battery life. They always need to be plugged in. They don't last long. \n\nYou might want to get something with a modern AMD Ryzen 8000 series CPU. The integrated graphics are good for some light gaming. These CPU are also power efficient so you get good battery life.\n\nAsus Zenbook S16 and Zenbook 14 should be the models to consider. The models with AMD Ryzen CPUs.",

  "1700€ or 900€ laptop?? OBJECTIVES:\nI need a laptop for working in the summer and at the library, so I don’t have to carry my desktop and monitor. Remote work isn’t an option due to poor WiFi in cafes and libraries.\n\nPrograms I use: Houdini, Unreal Engine, After Effects, Premiere Pro, Blender\n\nLaptops Considered:\n\t•\tMSI Katana ❌ Poor reviews, cheap plastic build\n\t•\tHP Omen ❌ Selling old stock with black screen issues (might be fixed in 2025)\n\n\t•\tLenovo Legion Slim 5 (RTX 4060, 32GB) Good materials, solid cooling, positive reviews. The Slim version may not be ideal, but a classmate using it for Houdini says it performs well. \n\n\t•\tLenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 8 (RTX 4070, Ryzen 9, 32GB) €1699. Good performance, but Lenovo laptops reportedly overheat and die after ~5 years.\n\t•\tGigabyte Aorus 16X 9SG ❓ Great cooling system, but I don’t know much else.\n\n\nMY THOUGHTS: \nI need a powerful laptop but not top-tier—spending over 1000€ doesn’t make sense since it won’t match my desktop anyway. \n\nInitially, I considered the Lenovo Legion Pro 5 (RTX 4070, Ryzen 9, 32GB, 1TB) for Houdini and Unreal, but realistically, I only need it for Unreal (mid-high workloads) and video editing. Houdini caching/rendering isn’t worth doing on a laptop—it’s better handled by my desktop, and 13h+ caching would destroy battery life.\n\nSo, for just Unreal and video editing, is a €1700€ laptop really worth it, or would a cheaper one with an older RTX and maybe 64GB RAM (+€200) be a smarter choice? I got the money but I feel like spending 900€ more for this purpose would be more worth it to spend in improving my other pc specs. ",
  "Please help me decide if I should stick with mac or try the Lenovo Yoga Currently running a mbp from early 2015.

  "Is this laptop good for video editing? Hello reddit, my girlfriend is looking for a good laptop to use for video editting. I have been looking around but dont know much about computers. Shes asked for my help and this is what I came up with. What do you guys think? Also a link to the website where I found it (dutch): https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1963276/lenovo-legion-slim-5-16aph8-82y9008nmh/specificaties/",
  "It depends what kind of video editing, 4K, 6K, 8K, which app you're using (Adobe cloud, Davinci Resolve), how many layers, effects, etc. It should be good enough to edit 4k even 6k footage. From what I can see, this one has Ryzen 7 7840HS which should be enough for Adobe Cloud apps as they are more CPU oriented, as well as rtx 4070 which should help with Davinci Resolve for example, as it is more GPU oriented. For video editing you also want to check color display which should be at least 100% srgb or even better, 100% Adobe srgb or  100% DCI-P3 color gamut. I can't seem to find that for this one from the information you've provided.\n\nGenerally speaking you want to look for Ryzen 7 or 9 from 7 series (you'll see some numbers like \"Ryzen 7 **7**840HS\" or \"Ryzen 9  **7**900HX\". When first number is 7 it means it's from that series). Also from Intel i7 or i9 from 13 series (you'll see some numbers like \"i7 **13**650h\" or \"i9 **13**900\" so when the first number is 13, it means it's from that latest series). For GPU go for rtx4060 (4070 is great btw) or higher. And look for screen colors like i mentioned before. Also, the more RAM, the better. 16 is good, but more is always better (the one you mentioned has expandable memory up to 32GB which is good as you can always add a bit more).\n\np.s. I'm no computer expert but I'm also on the lookout for a video editing laptop and after extensive research, I've opted for Vivobook 15 PRO oled with either i9 13900h CPU or with new Ultra 9 185h CPU, rtx 4060. It has OLED display with  100% DCI-P3 color gamut. And expandable RAM memory as well as thunderbolt 4. Both are at around 1500 euros, so if you want to spend a bit more, those ones I would recommend.\n\nAlso, I've watched this guy's videos  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf6MBfIiTUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf6MBfIiTUs)",

  "White Screen Flashes when surfing web or watching Netflix I got a new laptop with Black Friday (Lenovo Legion Slim 5 16APH8 82Y9008NMH).  When browsing the web or especially when opening a youtube video, the full screen turns white for a fraction of a second. Sometimes it holds the white screen for a few seconds. The flashes often go paired with a peak in GPU usage on my integrated graphics card, and \"Wifi\"  according to Task Manager.\n\nI sent it back to exchange it for a new one since it was within warranty period... Same exact thing happens with the second one. I sent that one back as well and again, the third computer is showing it too.\n\nI have really tried to look everywhere for what the cause could be. All drivers are up to date (first one had both GPUs disabled so I figured it was that at first, but the two others have the same issues and look fine as well). I set up all computers as a new PC. The third one I didn't even put in a mouse to check if it was that, but no. Hardware issues seem unlikely due to it being a problem on all three of them (and yet other buyers are giving positive reviews, so it is unlikely they face the same issue.\n\nI use Fusion360 as well (3D modeling software) and that doesn't show any white screens at all throughout a full day. I have the issue with different wifi networks. I use Google Chrome, and have yet to test it with other browsers.\n\nThe other weird thing is that the numlock on all three of them is switched up: the indicator light is *on* when it is turned *off,* and vice versa. No clue if this has something to do with it, but wanted to include it in the post, maybe it helps. There don't appear to be other problems with the machine.\n\nAny ideas or advice would be appreciated! Thanks in advance",

  "Vostro 7510 Review/ Advice Request  \n\nI really appreciated this (and other) reddit when I was searching for a laptop, and wanted to return the favor with a quick review of this laptop. I am not a formal laptop reviewer, and don’t have fancy gizmos to check nits or color accuracy, but wanted to share. I have only been using it for about a day or two, and I may or may not post some updates as I use this more. There’s also some chance that I will return it. \n\nModel: [https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations)\n\n(purchased on sale for $1150 + 10% CB).\n\nI wouldn’t mind some advice from the sub on whether to keep this or return for one of two slightly more gamery computers that will seemingly solve some of the issues I have with this - either the Lenovo Legion 7 Slim or the HP Omen 16.1 AMD (if it gets released on HP’s site soon enough). \n\n**Background:**\n\nI joined a small business and needed a laptop. I purchased my last laptop \\~11 years ago and while it aged gracefully… that's like 85 in laptop years. Business required that the laptop have Windows 10 Pro, and preferred that it have biometric security. I wanted it to be thin, and have good build quality so it will hold up well. I also wanted to be able to play the new AOE when it comes out (i.e., light RTS and 4x type games). Finally, I needed the laptop yesterday so I didn’t have time to wait around for the best deal.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\nI think this laptop falls short in a few ways: (1) it spontaneously shut down the first day I was using it. Enough battery, updated Microsoft drivers, and no indication of why when I turned it back on. Not sure what it was, but I updated the Dell drivers and it hasn't happened again in the few hours of use since that. (2) Battery life could be better, once I was down to less than 40% after about 3 hours of (non-gaming) use (downloading and installing some applications, light browsing). As I type this I have 2:56 estimated remaining at 77% of the battery on “better battery” setting. The battery estimate was also all over the place. I don’t think it’s fair to expect much more out of a 56 whr battery, but I think it is fair to expect more than a 56 whr battery in this kind of laptop. (3) The keyboard is ok - typing feels nice enough, although I liked my old Lenovo’s keyboard a little bit better. The backlighting is a joke. (4) Cooling. I ran Offworld Trading Company, which was free from Epic Games at the time I received this computer, and after less than 15 minutes of play I found the palm rest to be warm, and (using a food thermometer) found the temperature to be over 100 fahrenheit on the speakers, and about 127 fahrenheit right underneath the vents. The fans were noticeably loud as well. Task manager says the GPU got up to 65c. That seemed pretty warm for a few minutes of play on a 5 year old game.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\nThe strengths are in the specs: i7 with a 3050ti, aluminum chassis (there is a very thin plastic bezel around the screen, but it's small enough to get over. Pretty good build quality. Touchpad is spacious. It’s relatively heavy for a 2021 laptop, but it has a dGPU and is pretty thin. Screen is pretty nice and color accurate, although I suspect nothing special in 2021. And I will be able to play aoe4 on this (when it comes out). \n\n**Dell Customer Service:**\n\nI also wanted to call out a good experience with Dell Customer Service. Without getting into the details, they made things right quickly and followed up to make sure things ended up ok. \n\n**Request for Advice:**\n\nWhen I was looking at this I was also between the Lenovo Legion 7 slim which is a few hundred dollars more, but has a higher refresh screen and the 3060. I decided that because I am looking to play RTS/4x games that are typically not AAA graphically intensive, a 3050 would be enough and I would be better saving the money. \n\nI was also considering the new HP Omen AMD 16.1, but it still hasn't been released on HP’s website (where they have frequent 10% off gaming PC sales), and given that I need something now, I may not be able to wait until they can ship it.\n\nNow that I have used the Vostro, and have pointed out the above concerns, do you think I’ll get (a) significantly better battery life on one of those other options, and (b) is the cooling significant enough to cause problems with my use of the Dell?",
  "Just 1 question. Does it have 1 or 2 SO-DIMM memory slots??\n\nOne review said 8GB is soldered. One Dell maintenance manual shows 2.\n\nI'm between this and the 15\" LG Ultra with the GTX 1650 Ti. The Dell has the true full size number pad, but the LG's is the crammed version.  For me this is between soldered ram or not. If 1 is soldered, then I'll have a tough decision. \n\nSo, please pop the back cover and let us know?\n\nThanks!!",

  "I just got this laptop RTX3050 version, and I have to say, I believe the design around the battery life and cooling system is very poor. I thought mine is broken, after reading similar stories from other owners similar experiences are confirmed. I’m frustrated and disappointed with this product from Dell. The battery needing to be bigger and cooling system larger. IMO it’s flawed heavily. You can’t game on it either, the RTX3050 is very weak. The screen is average. Considered returning it for a different model but I’m too busy at work. \n\nWould not go with a dell laptop again. I could of paid slightly more and got a different manufacturer with better specifications and most likely none of these cooling and battery issues.\n\nSorry Dell, but this product is piss poor.\n\nEdit: ram dota2 as a test, can’t even get more than 30fps avg, 1080p max textures details. My desktop with Radeon RX5700XT and an old 6 core sandy bridgy CPU sits just below 200 avg\n\n30fps avg in an esports game isn’t playable.\n\nEdit2:  it sure what dell were targeting with its design, it can’t go anywhere without its charger very nearby. Poor gaming performance, terrible thermals. That leaves users with an always plugged laptop that only runs word processing applications and runs like a volcano doing it.\n\nEdit3: screen is 60hz. 2021 they release a mid range laptop with this? Dell are you high? Reason I bought it? It was 40% off. I almost got my boss one whilst awaiting shipping. Pretty glad I didn’t get my employer an absolute dud laptop, that seems like dell were trying to offload\n\nEdit4: finally. At work we run all dell emc servers. Lost a lot of faith on dell consumer, and as a whole if they are pulling this kind of crap I n 2021. We are due for a major upgrade, HPE looking much more convincing",

  "I would wonder why the GTX card if not gaming... I mean, the type of computing (ML, linear algebra) I use for work with an Nvidia card is more demanding than gaming.  If it can't handle gaming, then it can't handle a work setting that requires a GPU.  Otherwise, most workers don't need a dedicated GPU for work (with Word, browsing, etc).  Just puzzled, what's the point of providing a GPU that can't handle gaming.",
  "I have one, same specs as OP but regular 3050, not Ti. It has 2x m.2 slots. The OEM ssd is a very short m2 2230 drive. The other M2 slot can take a normal full length SSD. The short OEM 2230 ssd drive is in the longer m2 slot with a weird metal arm to anchor it to the screw down hole at the end. So if you buy one of these you need to move the OEM ssd to the other m2 slot, then stick your full length SSD in the m2 slot you just took the OEM out of.\n\nIt's easy, and already inside the case are the two heat sinks for SSDs. One small copper one for the OEM shorter 2230 ssd, and a full size heatsink for a normal m2 ssd. \n\nEdit: As per my reply to the other guy below, the battery life is absolute ass on this.",

My Ryzen 4800u with integrated graphics can only handle about low medium graphics. So this thing's pretty decent.\n\nDepending on what you're doing, keep in mind the **battery life is horrible** on this thing. I'm getting worse life than OP when just doing very basic light tasks. I get 3 1/2 to 4 hours max. This is with screen brightness low, no USB devices, the 3050 dGPU disabled, and just using a webbrowser. No gaming or streaming. I've done all manner of tests to squeeze out better battery life and have had not luck (OS reinstall clean, different drivers, setting max CPU usage to 30%, etc.). Dell support told me 4 hours is good battery life for this laptop and referred to the battery as a ***backup battery***.\n\nAlso, if you plan to dual boot to linux this thing won't sleep properly. You can set it to suspend, which defaults to s2idle and uses about 14% battery per hour. Manually modifying the system to deep sleep doesn't work properly, it will start to sleep, then spin up the fans and turn on the keyboard light. This is with Nvidia proprietary driver software and the dGPU off and iGPU on. After researching it, lot's of dell notebooks are doing thing. Dell's forums show things like \"this model doesn't support being set to suspend/sleep and put in a bookbag\".\n\nHopefully this info helps. I'm in the process of returning mine. It's a nice enough laptop, but averaging 3.5 hours of battery life from extremally light tasks with my mentioned battery saving attempts is bad, the linux sleep thing is bad too.\n\nIf you'll mostly be on AC power all day, you'll be fine. But if you're on battery it will not last. Gaming will kill the battery even faster, and it will lower its performance dropping the frame rate badly on battery.",
  "Hey I think your laptop may be broken or you are using it unplugged, because a 3050 usually runs dota 2 at around 120fps at the 65W. Do you run dota while plugged in? because it only uses the integrated intel graphics when unplugged which could explain the low fps.",
  "I ended up buying the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro with an RTX card, dual DIMM slots, and dual SSD slots.  It's a great laptop as long as you don't need battery life beyond 3-4 hours.  LOL",
  "Hey question, are you using windows 10 or 11? I know windows 11 has hit ALOT of laptops negatively in terms of battery life. I’ve heard some people getting up to 4 hours less than they would in windows 10.",
  "To tell the truth I didn’t run it more than a few hours on win10. I did find turning on battery saver made a difference, but it wasn’t major enough. I did also find apps like the brave browser automatically using the dGPU for no reason, setting windows to force it into the iGPU helped a bit.\n\nI did run manjero Linux and was getting batter battery life than when 11, but maybe just an extra 30 mins of light usage.\n\nOver all, I think the battery capacity (56Wh) is just a bit too low for something with an 11800h and dGPU. I tried buying an 86Wh battery from Dell before sending the Vostro back, but they don’t have them in stock.\n\nI moved to a Lenovo P1 G4. That has a 91wH battery, It’s easy to get 4.5-5 hours on that thing without effort.\n\nEdit: more info.",
  "Oh okay thank you for specifying more! Yeah brave turns on hardware acceleration by default for some reason. It’s quite annoying 😂 had a time I was wondering why my laptop fans were spooling up every time I opened brave and was always at a steady 10-30% usage.",

  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",
  "Lenovo legion 5 pro after 1 year, is this normal? I don't use it in dirty environments or in bed often, idk how it got so bad ",

  "What the fuck",

  "No words",
  "You dirty pig 🤢",
  "Pet dander.",
  "That's mostly fabric, they're usually the ones that can clog, regular dust will just go-in then out the vents easily. It's a combination of how good the intake filter is and how much time do you use your laptop inside you room. 1 year cleaning interval is not normal, you may even consider it as neglect.",
  "The fan determined that’s a lie",
  "It's impossible to have a dust free environment, this is normal and you should definitely keep an eye on it. Ignoring it for too long can cause your computer to overheat. My motherboard was shot from overheating and this is probably why",
  "Does it void the warranty to open the laptop's case?",
  "Fans don't make dust... You do (lots of skin cells in dust). \n\nSo, this has been in a dusty environment this is why it's important to clean out laptops every so often. They will load themselves up with dust quicker than you realize",
  "Absolutely NOT normal, I fix laptops for a living and this is crazy bad for 1 year lol",
  "How often did you use it? For example I have a Asus TUF a16 laptop that got dusty after 3 months of having it and I used it everyday playing games all the time. I don't have a laptop stand so the fans didn't get particularly good airflow so that's why it got dusty",
  "Do you vape? the residue will attract dust.",
  "Have you been using it as a part time laundry drier?",
  "Lol take any cloth you own into a bright room and whip it around. That’s what’s in your laptop",
  "Is it turned on a lot? When the fans are spinning they collect far more dust than if it was turned off. When those fan blades spin at a higher RPM the friction in the air causes the fan blade to build up a electric charge which attracts more dust along the active edge of the blade until you get a sizable mass of it blocking airflow. I would say that looks pretty normal for a laptop that sees heavy use. Laptops don't tend to come with the filters you see in desktop builds so dust has easier time getting caked in there, especially with heavy use.",
  "Stop crying and just clean it",
  "One possible explanation is the fan is somehow spinning when it's in my backpack, but lid closed = sleep so idk how that can happen.\n\nEdit: I overlooked the obvious - my little brother took over my room and now I'm set up in my walk in closet. All the clothes probably release a lot of lint.",

  "Clean it and everything will be ok.",
  "Hmmmm, I should check my fans…",
  "oh my god no not normal must have been on carpet",
  "If you use your laptop 24/7 and leave it always running then yeah even in a clean environment this would make sense. \n\nI use my laptop occasionally over a few years and there was almost no dust in my fans. \n\nIt's important to vacuum your living space frequently and keep your laptop on a desk. If you have pets, they exponentially increase dust intake. Having this level of dust in one year just points at a high level of dust environment.\n\nI would clean it every 3 months if this is what you gathered over a year. You lost a lot of performance and efficiency overtime, you will gain it back once it's cleaned though.",

Don't let it pile that much, buy a can of compressed air and blow a bit every month. Not a full clean just a few puffs is more than enough to keep it clean.",
  "Gaming laptops are not meant to be used a laptops.

  "What the fuck\n\nYour environment is probably more dirty than you think it is.",

Want it clean? Get a dehumidify and air purifier.",
  "Clean once a month or two with compressed air\n\nIts worth buying a cheap 3m air filter that takes A/D/H filters or you can run the furnace fan more often it does a good job cleaning",
  "If you use it in your lap, it’s just sucking lint and dust off you. Lots of factors to consider. Likewise the humidity around you. Seems like vacuuming or just running an air filter would be good, for your own health",

About 6 months ago I finally cracked it open cleaned it because I noticed dust accumulation on exterior fan intake mesh and it was nowhere near this bad.

Haven't moved it in years.",

  "Lenovo is shit, thats prolly why.",
  "This has to be bait.",
  "Fine dust might not be visible to you, but if there is any on the desk, laptop fans will find it. That definitely needs cleaning. I have a Legion 5, and because of how the vent is designed, it's pretty obvious when it sucks up dust. The bottom intakes change color to grey, and that's when I clean mine",
  "X doubt",
  "Forbidden Cocaine",
  "While my fan does not look close to this, I can see through the venting that it does have some dust and debris caked on. What would be the best way to clean this as I’m a total novice when it comes to taking a laptop apart",

  "You in a nasty environment for sure.  Ignorance is bliss if you think otherwise.  Wtf",
  "Do you shut it down overnight? My 24/7 running dell wyse looks the same after 6 months of uptime. However, my PC and laptop are really clean after two years of normal use (6 hours a day)",
  "Only normal in a dusty environment.",
  "That is mostly dead skin. \n\nHow often do you take a shower? Once a month if you need it or not?",
  "Easy to clean. They still work, just not as well when covered like that, so not super end of world as long as you let it breathe normally. Take a clean toothbrush and turn the fan as you move the bristles along the fins to push the dust, then use some electronics grade canned air for the best results. Other kinds of canned air can cause Static damage to other components if used.",
  "This is exactly what mine looked like the first time I opened it up and I only have it on a desk. A lot of things can get sucked into those fans so just make sure to keep them clean and be a little more aware of where you put it",
  "If in a clean environment, this can happen if the laptop is powered on for long enough. If it's only 1 year old, and if the environment is clean, I believe you almost never turn it off.\n\nIf you do turn it off whenever you're not using it, then I believe your environment is not as clean as you think.\n\nAlso, if you or someone around you vapes, the vapor can cause dust to stick a lot more than it otherwise would. It could also be the case that there were just a few really dusty days and ever since it's been running hot and the fan is always running at top speed, collecting even more dust.",
  "And I thought my bedroom was a dustbowl for having nothing built up on the fan, and the heatsink fins themselves being about 1/4 lightly covered after two years daily driver use",
  "Holy crap that does not look normal. Surprised it hasn't died due to heat damage yet.",
  "How could you possibly say you don’t use it in dirty environments when the fan looks like that? Come on now.",

  "I wish my wife were that dirty.....",
  "If that's the fan, I wonder how you lungs look like (0.0)",

  "How dirty is your place?!\nI didn't clean my laptop fans for almost 3 years and they barely changed color from the dust!",
  "It doesn't matter how clean thr house is, don't use a laptop on the fucking carpet, especially not a gaming laptop.\n\nThis makes me sick, get a board or something to set it on at least, how would you like if every breath you took, was through some dusty old carpet, would probably mess you up too.",
  "You have a cat or dog?",
  "Just think if this is your lungs. Not Good. Recommend cleaning almost every 3-6 months",
  "You'd be surprised about all the sources of dust. Does it sit on a desk? Dust. Does it sit in your lap? Dust. Etc. \n\nI thought my home was pretty dust-free until I got on the air purifier bandwagon. Whether or not the work, that's up for debate. There's no question about them removing dust from the air",
  "Vaping/smoking anything will cause it to condense on almost anything. A bedroom fan will catch a ton of it, and get dirty before a laptop fan. My old roommate vaped and did dabs, then came to me complaining about her fan being junked up. Her room is kept very clean but condensate and natural dust (as well as three cats) did a huge number on the fan and all its parts. Cleaned it out and applied a little wd40, took longer to get really nasty. \n\nBeing clean won't stop the natural accumulation of dust, and places where air moves a lot usually won't accumulate dust like this UNLESS there's moisture in some form. Weather that's from taking the laptop from cool to warm places or vica-versa, vaping nicotine or any plant materiel, taking it to the bathroom even after a shower or during can cause droplets to form on the blade. Even teeny, tiny droplets will pick up ambient dust. \n\nAnd there is dust. Dead skin cells, hairs, residues from cooking and even cleaning chemicals can create or disturb dust, and it'll settle or stick as it must. Best thing to do is clean that puppy as best you can, and do periodic dust checks on any form of electronics. Little old lady homes that are spotless will have PC and TV fans covered in junk from having a human around, and a liberal application of febreeze.",

The machine stays very very quiet and pulls of a 11,3xx CB23 score which is actually a good bit faster than any review i've seen.  The best part is how cool to the touch this machine is under load/gaming..  Probably the coolest running chassis in a long time, granted the CPU is only pulling like 20\\~ watts while gaming even though I have it set at 40w (game dependent of course will change this).    It's a wonderful machine overall, not perfect but pretty amazing as a daily driver.   Battery tests coming soon..

Gotta test more first before I continue with anything else. \n\nIts a bit unfair to compare like this, but I do get a better experience off with a MBP 14 M1 Pro as the laptop seems more fluid compared to this.

  "So, the laptop is pretty awesome. I’ve had it all week and have found that it’s gotten better with use. The first day I almost took it back because the touchpad was so bad and their own Lenovo Vantage application kept crashing. Once all the updates took effect and the laptop had time to settle in, there were no more issues. \n\nThe WiFi is incredibly fast, and I’ve never experienced a faster initial connection and any device ever, including iPads and iPhones and MacBooks. Instantaneous to the router as soon as your password is in. \n\nThe main feature of the snapdragon version was supposed to be the “snappiness” and the battery life. But this thing has been nothing but snappy—everything happens instantaneously. I’ve never had a machine this responsive. It’s like having your car switch gears without ever feeling the change in the transmission, just unbelievably smooth. That being said, nothing will be the battery life on a Mac, so there’s no real reason to compare. Their ARM efficiency is so vastly ahead of the competition that it’s not even a fair comparison. They’re strange machines to me (MacBooks) in that their computing power is unrivaled, but their interface makes them look like toys for kids rather than serious machines, which I suppose they are but just never really feel that way. My use case on the daily is for Windows-based computing, so that’s why I returned the m3 air I bought earlier this year (that and their new keyboard is awful, paper thin and the keys so closely placed I couldn’t type properly. I was going to lose my mind). Was able to get through work days with no battery life issues, ended up around 40% every day with about 5-6 hours of use, so definitely use dependent. I am not sure if the battery is compromised by having to run a virtual desktop all day? I’m sure someone here can better attest to that. \n\nThe screen is glorious—I’ve never been a fan of OLED for a laptop so that’s actually a plus for me. I almost went and bought a refurbished Lenovo for the mini LED screen it featured, but it was much bigger and heavier than this laptop. \n\nThe portability is insane; the engineering to pack a 15.3” screen while using essentially the body of a 14” laptop is mind boggling. I was reliant on my 2018 intel MacBook Air (still just perfect except for the giant bezels and dwindling battery life) until the aura, and, when you place the 13.3” air over the aura there’s only minimal excess laptop all around. Just an exceedingly slim experience. \n\nI wish the materials were just a tad more premium, with the feeling of the sleek aluminum from the Air still more solid in the hand. Being able to open the laptop with one hand would have been nice, but life goes on. \n\nThe x1carbon aura will probably be the perfect machine w the haptic pad and the choice of oled or IPS based on your preference, so if you’re willing to wait and spend double the cash for the same specs and a one pound lighter laptop then I would do so. I didn’t think it was worth all the extra cash for the upgraded materials, essentially doubling the cost. The HD is fast enough, and for my purposes shelling out extra for a 2280 disk would have made no discernible difference in daily use. \n\nAll in all, stunning and I’m glad I waited for this instead of the yoga 9i meteor lake which was what I was considering previously. \n\n32g \n1 tb \nWindows 11 pro\nAt no additional cost on Lenovos website I was able to also add Office Pro and Acrobat 2020, so that’s an extra $500 or so of software. Good deal right now\n\nArrow Lake and Panther Lake look promising. The future is bright for intel, and the spinoff on their design business is going to be one to invest in for sure.",

  "It's made out of aluminum, but when i played around with the yoga 9i and the slim 7x they just felt like better quality. The one thing I didn't mention was the keyboard--it's phenomenal. The main reason I didn't consider the HP or the ASUS, the two main competing lunar lake laptops that look really phenomenal, was that I really disliked their keyboards. This is the best typing experience I may have ever had on a laptop. It's not that this computer isn't well built--it certainly is, it has the military grade durability and so on, but it just doesn't have a \"pro\" look or feel. You can tell it's consumer-grade material. It's like comparing a commercial kitchen product to a consumer grade line--they may be moth stainless steel but there's just a difference in the quality that's probably related objectively in some way, but it's difficult for me to describe or quantify. Please note this is a really nitpicky thing to say--this is the best laptop I've ever owned, and it's not close. I was between this and a macbook pro14\", but I'm super satisfied and felt like it was a great deal to upgrade the RAM to 32 and the 1 tb HD w the free office pro/acrobat std. Really good deal and very high quality with an excellent processor. The silence and coolness of the laptop are really evident as well. I played COD MWIII just to see how it ran compared to my prior Microsoft Surface Book 2 from 2017 which had 16 gb ram and a NVDA 3050 card, and it's not even close how smooth and well this computer handled it. \n\n  \nWould highly recommend if the OLED was an issue for you, because most manufacturers seem to be going OLED route, so if you are happy w the Snapdragon chip and there's no compatibility issues, the only real competitor here would be the Surface laptop, which would cost you another 1500 to have all of the above specs/software. I have been waiting to see what was next for my laptop world since it's been so long, I had to learn a lot about the chip game to understand what I was waiting for. I think the only thing I'd say is if you're not in a hurry, see how these compare to Strix point laptops. If you're like me and have more basic needs that aren't super tech dependent, this is an excellent daily driver. Of course if you have a specialized need you're probably not in this forum anyhow. \n\n\n\nFor the money, you can't get a better laptop. \n\n  \nHope that helps!",

  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",

But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button.

  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",

  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues.

Same strain when docked. Seems to be recent intel GPU’s from what I’ve read, causing issues for those sensitive to dither, or whatever rendering technique it is that causes the pain.",
  "The Aura screen dimensions are compatible with the MacBook Air 15. Get a MBA 15 compatible matte screen protector, and it'll greatly reduce glare and reflections on the Aura.",
  "was this 16 or 32gb of ram?",
  "BTW, as an update to my experience, I have my touchscreen replaced as it seems to be touchscreen issue instead of touchpad. For a week, touchwood, no such touchpad issues anymore.\n\nThe only remaining gripe I have would be the lack of compatibility with my GPD G1.",
  "Have you uninstalled McAfee already? It will greatly improve system performance. The Microsoft antivirus software built in Windows is better. That's probably the first thing to do after unpacking a new Lenovo laptop.",
  "It's really subjective. Do you have any issues with other modern devices? In laptops I find Intel Xe iGPU's to be bad for eye strain, Nvidia perfectly fine, AMD tolerable but not ideal.",
  "For my ghost touches issue, turns out I went to Lenovo repair centre to have screen replaced, then as of these weeks the ghost touch issue is gone for me.",
  "how did it go? did you send it in and is it still working?",
  "Hello \n\nI am going to buy this laptop soon.\n\nIs there display glare problem a deal breaker?  \nSome people mentioned : glossy displays leading to poor battery life because you have to crank up brightness to max to combat glare.\n\nThanks",
  "Its not easy to buy a laptop nowadays. many models and there are issues on each model. No windows laptop is perfect it seems, unless you pay big amount to Thinkpad series highend one.",
  "Luckily the 15.3\" screen is the same size as the Macbook Air 15, so you could pick up a matte screen protector.",
  "[I just reviewed it](https://smbtech.au/features/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-aura-edition-laptop-review/) and got 26.5 hours. That's a new record on my site.",
  "After using for some time, I think it’s similar to surface laptop screen. It’s reflective but with decent resolution. Colors are vibrant. I mostly work inside so it’s been fine. Working outside might be slightly tough because the screen is pretty reflective (not as good coating as MacBook). If you turn up the brightness to 100% that might make it better for outside work.",
  "I think the same, if not even better.   So loud and clear and good bass too.   I've tested both the 14\" and the 15.3 and had zero issues.  I think the one this person is talking about was just a lemon",
  "Not really, I just got used to it.",
  "Barely but yes. You can be outside (in the shade of course) and make do while in light mode. It's a mirror though, so you gotta find the right angle.",
  "Thank you so much - I really appreciate it. This makes it a buy for me. ",
  "Glad I could help make that tough decision! Not many choices right now that are similar to Yoga 7i Aura Edition but hoping we get some new releases soon...",
  "I read about a couple folks mentioning unresponsive touchpad in some YouTube comments and in r/lenovo comments as well",
  "You probably don't need this anymore but its around 8 hours minimum for demanding stuff, WAY higher with regular use. Much more than one needs. If you plan on using it for several days in a row, just bring the charger.",
  "As I sit here looking at my non-upgradeable to Windows 11 Surface Book 2.  You felt and looked premium, I paid a lot for your middle tier processor, I learned what heat throttling was, sometimes you think the screen is disconnected when it isn't, we had a good run. No more MS laptops for me thanks.",
  "Just read it, some great detailed insights there. Definitely swaying me towards getting the SL7, especially given the low/no noise from the fans which is very important to me. Thanks for replying!",
  "How would you compare the screen reflectivity between the SL7 and the Aura? Still waiting for my Aura to arrive",
  "OK, thanks for trying, it is good to know that it is not compatible... by the way, there are several variants, depending on the model (eg 1 or 2 fans) : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qjlal2/tpfan_control_on_newer_thinkpads_share_your/\n\nOn the Aura, there is also a built-in BIOS configured power management, accessible through Fn+Q command : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1fufeoa/lenovo_yoga_slim_7i_aura_edition_ama/lqcjek5/",
  "What if you set the performance/fan mode to quiet? Does that make it quiet enough? I'm thinking of getting this too and have heard mixed reviews about fan noise",
  "Ya, it’s been hit or miss on battery life. Touchpad gets finicky w longer use, appears to be pretty sensitive to the oils on the skin and any grime so I try to use the mouse. I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",
  "Its actually not too bad in person (at best buy) when viewed side by side to the book 4 screen.   I think the book 5 screen has more anti-reflective coating and they did not have that model for testing.",
  "Is the reflection problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "Does anyone tried this?",
  "It had been on sales for £1100 for the Aura 258V 32GB RAM model in the UK (e.g. Lenovo Store, Currys).",
  "Yes the 32 GB version with Intel 258V. Seems like some of the discounts are now gone.",
  "I have the same ghost touch issue, sending it in for repair under warranty in 2 days.  \nhow was you experience with the repair and is it still working?  \nAsking since i have heard many bad things about Lenovo's repair service.",
  "May i ask if you’ve found a solution for connecting to the gpd g1? I am looking to buy a compact egpu to use with the slim 7i aura on the go. 🙏",
  "That was one of the first things I did",
  "I'm looking to replace an old Dell XPS 9360 laptop with the following specs: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz 2.00 GHz. If I had no eye strain issues with this, do you think I should be ok with the Slim 7i Aura?",
  "Tell me how the type of graphics card can affect eye strain. Eye strain and other discomforts are caused by PWM and temporal dithering. These are defects or characteristics of displays, and intervening components are unlikely to be the cause, but I could be wrong. Please comment.",
  "I exchanged it",
  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast. The screen is very glossy though. if you work in a very bright room with bright background/light behind you, then yeah it can be very annoying to clearly see your reflection on the screen even at 80% brightness. it's depends see if you can find a sample in the nearest store.",
  "I like your little candy cane for scale",
  "Can you share me the settings that you have used while testing this and was there any major tweaks done to this? I got the same laptop but seems like my idle drain is little bit higher, although I did clean install of windows.",
  "Is it good?",
  "HP's new OmniBook Flip looks good, but its battery is a bit small. Maybe I'll wait for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura edition. It'll be very expensive at the release time though.",
  "A few alternatives appeared in recent months:\n\n[**MSI Prestige 14 AI Evo C1MG**](https://smbtech.au/features/msi-prestige-14-ai-evo-c1mg-laptop-review-2024/) – MSI’s, matte-screened 14-inch, business-oriented rival is larger, but more powerful.

  "Ah, interesting. Looks like a universal issue then.",
  "Both are glossy glass surfaces, but I remember the SL7 looked less reflective. The aura can look a bit mirror-like at times.",
  "My bluetooth is awful.  I can pair all devices, but they will NOT stay connected.  My earbuds connected, and I was able to use them for about 1 minute or so, but I could only get the Right side to receive sound.  There's something very very broken about the bluetooth on this machine.  It has been out since 2024, and it is shocking that it is still not fixed !!!  The internet is full of people with the same bluetooth issue.",
  "Yes, a few people on reddit shared their experience of this already. They said the outcome is comparable to the new M4 nano texture screen coating. Less reflection but more grainy, as you would expect.",

  "You could try to check if the problem is related to your Windows install, or a hardware issue (e.g. WiFi chip, antenna connection). \n\nOne relatively easy way would be to create a Linux bootable USB stick (e.g. Ubuntu). Boot up from the Linux USB stick and check the WiFi speeds. \n\nIf the speeds in Linux are normal, you could then try a \"clean install\" of Windows (download Windows USB install media from Microsoft website).\n\nIf the WiFi speed in Linux is also very low, then it might be worth opening up the laptop and checking the WiFi chip and antennas (does not void warranty). Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",
  "Did you exchange with the same model? Or what else did you get instead?",
  "Understand it looks like a deal breaker to me, however spec is really good on this pc.",
  "this comment is making me crack up ideky",

  "ThinkPads have great build quality, the 14 inch a bit too small for me tho. HP removed top firing speakers form Omnibook and no more USB-A port either.",
  "That's a nice list, thanks.",
  "I can see you currently have ranked the [MSI Prestige 14 AI Evo C1MG](https://smbtech.au/features/msi-prestige-14-ai-evo-c1mg-laptop-review-2024/) at #10 due to the price of your printing of **$1,899** (was formally your #1) with an Intel Core Ultra 5 (125H).  \nIm seeing priced at $1399 across multiple webshops sporting an Intel Core Ultra 7 (155H) - to me that represents even greater value, do you think its battery would be as efficient battery wise as the (U5-125H) that you reviewed?",
  "Yeah, for some reason it worked fine for me or maybe I just didn't notice it. I think a few BIOS updates can fix some of these pesky annoying issues in otherwise an ideal laptop.",
  "Now I'm thinking to just get the Yoga Pro 9i with the IPS. Should check all the boxes. Just not the battery life",
  "It is a glossy screen, so some glare is there, but not anything significant to be a deal breaker. Battery life has been excellent so far, usually lasts 5 to 8 hours on a single charge of 80%.",
  "Thank you for these suggestions, and I think I will try it. Can you please provide me with a link to such a Linux Bootable Stick download? I know I can search for it, but I feel you can provide me with a tested (and safe) solution.\n\nmeanwhile I found an acceptable solution using a tp-link wifi dongle",

  "You're welcome. I made it as part of my Aura review, [here](https://smbtech.au/news/datadog-showcases-expanded-ai-ml-and-aws-monitoring-features-at-reinvent/).",
  "If it's dropped like that again it will be Number 1, or very near it. Prices are a rollercoaster at this time of year and there's not much in it. There's a whisker between these and choosing what suits you best will leave you with a great laptop either way.",
  "The 9i looks like a nice machine especially with mini-LED, but the chassis is quite cheaply made, like the Pro 7. All plastic interior, including the hinge assembly.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

So you may have to try the links a few times. \n\nIf you have good WiFi speeds with an external USB WiFi dongle then this is also indicative of a hardware issue. I suggest you find a friend who can help you check out the WiFi inside your laptop.",
  "For the benchmarks, i go for the max possible score. I'll have Windows Set to Best Power efficiency and the Vendor's app set to maximum efficiency (no overclocking, USB charging turned off, silent mode if not low power, disable diacreet GPU if relevant etc).

  "hi I am someone using this laptop for a month. Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo. I have a desktop that goes 165hz and that's more for gaming. sure it's smooth and all but eh not worth the batt life tradeoff).\n\nif you realllly wanna stretch the life, use MS edge as ur browser cuz that's the least battery draining browser out there.

Unfortunately, she decided return the laptop after just one week as the case kept splitting open at the front under the touchpad. This indicates some poor built quality. I tried it out myself for a bit and also found the feeling and aesthetics rather on the cheap and plasticky side. The system also felt very sluggish and performed poorly in everyday web browsing and office tasks.\n\nAfter the MSI Prestige, I recommended my friend to get a full aluminium Lenovo Yoga 7i 14\" instead.

There are a few things I want to know before buying it.\n\n- Is the laptop not too heavy and big to put in a backpack to school everyday?\n- How long does it take to charge it / does it charge fast?\n- Did you experience some disadvantages? Which?\n\nThanks in advance for all the effort you put into answering the questions!",
  "Is the OS installed on the SSD or the HDD? Assuming you have that model.",
  "What screen did you get with your model? 60, 120, or 144hz? How is the brightness of the screen? From what I read the 120 hz screen has 250 nits which may be dimmer than what most people are use to.",
  "Hi, i want to buy this laptop, so i have few questions. After almost 2months, are hinges ok and are there any scratches? Because i want to use it for few years, so im curious about build quality. And is there any cons and disadvantages i should be aware of? How's battery life? Best regards.",
  "Do u plan to remove the stickers?",
  "Have you gotten any problem with it? I was thinking on recommending it for a friend who is looking for a laptop for light gaming and college",
  "If they’d have kept the trackpoint I would have been an instant buyer. Bahhhh Lenovo! \n\n(And before anybody thinks it’s just a preference, I’m fighting a neurological problem in my formerly dominant hand. Life is usually one-handed right now. Leaving that one good hand on the keyboard saves a LOT of time and makes some impossible things with a mouse or trackpad, possible.)",
  "does connecting the hdmi 2.0 to a TV uses the dedicated graphics card or the integrated?",
  "Can you change the color of the keyboard?",
  "Hi! I am probably a bit late to the party, but I just bought a Lenovo Legion 5 (AMD) and I wanna see if my touchpad is defective or if all Legion 5's are like that.\n\nWhat happens is that when I try to click at the top area of the touchpad, it doesn't ... well ... click - it feels as if the touchpad is not clickable there. Anywhere else below the top area is clickable . Is this how it is supposed to be ? or do I have a defective unit?\n\nThank you",
  "Hi I am thinking of buying this laptop with a R7 and a GTX as long as it fits my budget with 16 GB ram do you think it will be better or should I just go for  PC with an RTX 30 series because of its price?\n\nBecause I heard laptops dont last as long as Pc's do... And I can get better specs for around the same price. Whats your adivce Laptop or PC ?  \nThanks",
  "Is the 80 WHr pure SSD variant available ?",
  "have you played call of duty warzone? In everything at ultra what temperatures do you get? the cpu is around 80-83 ° C with peaks of 90 ° C. the gpu is always cold. with what do you measure the temperature? I use HWinfo. I have the ryzen 7 model with rtx 2060, I also use a base to lift it without fans",
  "Hi, looking to get this for university which means as well as gaming it also needs to be quiet for word processing in lectures. Don't want any looks from the sheeple on their MacBooks.\n\nCan the fans stay quiet when using basic applications?\n\nEdit: Also, soundcard? is it good? I like my music but could always get a USB DAC if its not.",
  "Weird flex bro 😂",
  "Why?",
  "I’m thinking of getting the same one. how’s it holding up after a year? any major problems?",
  "I have legion 5 Gen 6 ( 5800h, rtx 3060 130w,16gb ram,165 Hz FHD) \n\nI don't know why whenever I use my laptop on battery my screen stutters/ unstable fps on both watching movies and playing games like GTA 5 and ARK.\nIt works amazing when it's plugged in but it's very annoying when I use it on battery.\n\nCan anyone tell me how to fix it?",
  "Hey! I just got my Legion 5 and the touchpad seems a little bulgy and it presses down on the lower left side more as compared to that of the right lower side. Is it normal?",
  "Is it running well after two years of service?",
  "Yeah that's gonna take some time getting used to 😅",
  "I actually prefer that, now it has a full sized numpad unlike the Y540",
  "Thermals are great, but probably because I have it propped up off the table to give the intake better airflow, so far I've run jedi fallen order and gta v on it for multiple hours, maximum the CPU has ever hit was 80C, and the GPU never crossed 66C before",
  "Around 8 why?",
  "Color accuracy for the screen I chose isnt great because I wanted a higher refresh rate, 120hz, so my screen is rated at 45% sRGB, but there is a 60hz option with 100% sRGB if you need it. In terms of portability, not the best considering it is a gaming laptop albeit not the highest end, it comes in at 2.5kgs or around 5.5 pounds I think, in terms of thickness, around 2cm thick when closed, but the thickness does give the laptop a rather robust and sturdy feel to it",
  "Right results are in, so from 100% at 60% brightness the laptop lasts 2 hours and 41 minutes. This is running YouTube, Microsoft word and discord at the same time, I even had my webcam turned on for an hour, so without that itll probably last just about 3 hours",
  "Am about to test it, will update when I've got the results",
  " [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlsJG9X9DdE&t=254s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlsJG9X9DdE&t=254s) \n\nHere is a review legion 7i. It is in the Chinese language but you can auto-translate in English. In China, it is named as YY9000K. It might give an idea about the laptop.",
  "Why?",
  "It's got an AMD integrated GPU and a nvidia gtx 1650",
  "Yep, trackpad is good, I can very comfortably scroll and browse websites without having to touch my mouse at all",
  "Coding will be no sweat for this machine, the ryzen 7 4800h is more than powerful enough. But gaming... depends on the games you wanna play, for AAA titles I'd say maybe 4 years max, and that's playing games on minimum settings. Because the GPU isnt a high end card for today's standards so 6 years down the line... yeah probably not gonna be too good",
  "Its lenovo vantage, it came pre installed in the laptop",
  "Yep its quiet when not under heavy loads, if you're really worried about noise, the laptop can be set to quiet mode, so the laptop will automatically limit the speed of the cpu and gpu to keep fan noise down. As for using it on my lap, not the most comfortable because of its weight, and the damn numberpad at the side, because it means you cant rest your hands on the laptop in a symmetrical position to ensure the laptop stays balanced on your lap",
  "Trackpad feels good, sensitivity isnt way too low like my friend's laptop, and if you find it too sensitive you can lower it in the settings. Based on settings it does support windows 10 gesture control, it has 3 finger gestures and 4 finger gestures. Battery life is just shy of 3 hours on the balanced mode, but based on another reviewer, when set to the power saving quiet mode, it's just shy of 4 hours, but there are ways to improve the battery life but at the expense of performance of course. \n\nI bought this laptop purely based on specs and my personal faith and preference for lenovo products",
  "I find the gtx 1650 enough for me, I used to play using a nvidia 940mx so what you guys feel is subpar gaming performance to me is amazing gaming performance",
  "Yeah but a downside is that the webcam doesnt support windows Hello face recognition",
  "I disagree, I actually feel the build quality is great and the whole thing feels really sturdy, the hinges too, nothing about this laptop makes me feel the slightest bit of concern",
  "I paid 1556.47 singapore dollars which equates to 1115.75 usd",
  "Intel 10th gen CPUs when compared to AMD 4000 cpus are shit and far behind in performance",
  "I cant say for the 7I but mine certainly feels sturdy",
  "1. Yep it feels really sturdy, probably helped by its extra thickness, I generally disagree with those who say the hinges feel weak because when I opened it, it actually gives me good confidence that this machine will last, but who knows maybe it might weaken over time.\n\n\n2. Trackpad works great, it's really precise, I can comfortably lean back and use 1 hand on the track pad to browse websites, no need to pick up the mouse at all, only gripe is the number pad making the touchpad off centre and it just bugs me. As for keyboard, idk how to review this because I've never used what's objectively deemed a bad or lousy keyboard, but lenovo said they did copy the thinkpad keyboard design so I dont think you'll face any issues or discomfort. I personally find it comfortable.\n\n\n3. I took the 60 whr option as I needed a 1tb hdd to store all my school related stuff, but I'm not sure if the AMD version even has the option of the bigger battery. As for battery life, I'm actually about to test it, I've been running the laptop on battery conservation mode since I got it to prolong the battery lifespan, so I'm getting it to 100% now so I can start testing it, will update you when I got results",
  "Right results are in, so from 100% at 60% brightness the laptop lasts 2 hours and 41 minutes. This is running YouTube, Microsoft word and discord at the same time, I even had my webcam turned on for an hour, so without that itll probably last just about 3 hours",
  "build quality feels really good, the laptop as a whole just feels pretty sturdy. I think this laptop will last no less than 3 years, note im not someone who games on ultra settings, i am content gaming on low settings and lock to 30 fps, so if you have big gaming expectations, no way this will even last 2 years for you. As for battery life, im testing it as im typing this reply, im running on medium power setting, with youtube and microsoft word running at the same time to get a more accurate result",
  "Right results are in, so from 100% at 60% brightness the laptop lasts 2 hours and 41 minutes. This is running YouTube, Microsoft word and discord at the same time, I even had my webcam turned on for an hour, so without that itll probably last just about 3 hours",
  "Because I'm a student and I need a laptop, and having a desktop means I need to deal with constantly transferring files back and forth to get my work done, plus I'm not interested in the pc master race either. I'll probably only switch to desktop when I get a job and need a workstation",
  "Nope, but it can charge your phone using a cable through the usb c port",
  "I'm currently running a test to see how long 100% lasts while on youtube, mc word and discord",
  "In a well lit room I need the brightness at at least 50% to see clearly, I havent tested outdoors because well I'm stuck at home right now",
  "Mine came with a gtx 1650, but it's a laptop version so it cant be compared at all with your desktop",
  "Idk, you should go email lenovo for that",
  "The screen I chose is only 45% sRGB but 120hz. But if you need 100% sRGB for content creation, it is available too, but only 60hz and it needs a additional $10. Build quality wise, it is solid, it feels robust",
  "I cant measure it, I dont have any equipment. But it isnt ridiculously loud even at performance mode, with my game volume at around 50, I can hear my game clearly, or with headphones on, can't hear the fans at all",
  "Same here, I personally never use the number pad and would have much preferred if they used the space to give the keys more space between each other, I'm still regularly hitting the wrong keys because I've always used the touchpad and sides of the keyboard to align my hands",
  "I would say AMD, more cores for lower price, and especially if you top up to get the ryzen 7 4800h, it can match the performance of the latest i9 10980hk",
  "I never heard of a legion 5 coming out on june 21st, is that just the release date for your region?",
  "Speaker sound is abit soft for me because I have it propped up off the table using these little rubber pieces on each of the 4 corners, so the bottom firing speakers arent able to have the sound bounce off the table, but the laptop does come installed with Dolby Atmos for gaming, and in jedi fallen order, there was a 7.1 surround sound option for audio. As for heat, generally most of the heat is towards the centre of the computer, near the hinge and away from the main WASD keys, so no major concern of keys being hot to the touch",
  "Nope, but I already had a permanent subscription on my Microsoft account, so logging in was all I had to do",
  "Unfortunately the option for a gtx 2060 is not available yet, lenovo said it will be coming later in the year, so I dont know anything about how much it would cost",
  "In the bios, there is switchable Graphics. so u can turn it on. In addition, Lenovo vantage allows you to toggle the hybrid mode which means it only activates the dgpu only when gaming or other gpu intensive stuff",
  "Fan noise isnt very much, honestly when I was playing more demanding games like jedi fallen order, having the volume at 50/100 was enough for me to hear all the game audio very clearly over the fan noise, as for the LOL test, I'm not a league of legends player but with how low the requirements to run it are, I'd imagine 120 fps should be no sweat for this laptop",
  "I ordered on 22nd may, UPS delivered it to my door on 3rd June",
  "Uh, any idea on how I could run a test?",
  "Pretty decent, the only benchmark worthy game I have is jedi fallen order, I get a very consistent 80+ fps, occasionally it dips to around 70+ fps. This is on the max settings.",
  "By the way, you can still consider buying the AMD version, lenovo will be adding the option for better GPUs later this year, up to a rtx 2060",
  "Nope, processor has never exceeded 82C ever, and GPU never exceed 66C, this is playing jedi fallen order on epic settings",
  "only intel variants. But in the bios, switchable graphics is available. Hybrid mode on lenovo vantage works similar too",
  "It's not battery saving mode which stops the charging at 60% its conservation mode, in Lenovo vantage there is rapid charging and conservation mode. As for the keyboard backlight, I have the issue too, but honestly it's quite a insignificant problem since the backlight does still work",
  "I ordered with student discount, without it you should be able to get similar spec just that instead of ryzen 7 you can probably only get the ryzen 5.\n\nAs for lenovo customer support, amazing honestly. Every time I've emailed the Singapore lenovo customer support, I get a reply the next business day, some times even just a few hours after I sent the email. Plus there's quite a funny story with how I got my laptop so fast.\n\nThe story is that when I ordered it, the product page says expected to ship within 6-8 weeks, but then the next day it changed to ship within 4 weeks, so I wrote a email to customer support asking to clarify, the rep apologized and said he'd help me email the shipping team to expedite my order and the next thing I knew, my laptop was shipped out in less than a week. Reached my house in 10 days.\n\nIf you want a cheaper option with similar ish specs, L340 Gaming is your best bet, has the same gtx 1650 but only a  i7 9750h",
  "I got mine for SGD$1309+ 93(GST)\nRyzen 7 4800H\n512SSD\nNvidia Geforce GTX 1650\n300nits 144hz screen\n\ni used the coupon code CUPONATION15 to get 15% off. (Shaved off almost 250 off)[Found it by googling lenovo discount code]\n\nOrdered mine on 3rd july tis yr prolly still works>",
  "There are 2 m.2 nvme slots, but you can choose to have a hdd instead if you want cheaper storage, but you can always remove it in the future to install your own nvme ssd. As for the single channel ram, I cant say for sure, since the ram is running at 3200mhz, considerably faster than the intel counterparts, it shouldn't struggle to run anything unless you've got loads of apps running at the same time",
  "Seems really average, just a standard 720p camera you will find in many other laptops",
  "What do you mean by tint? And yes you can add a 2.5 inch HDD, I have one added. Y540 has slower processors, 9th gen i5 and i7 are no match for ryzen 5 4600h or ryzen 7 4800h. Y540 has slower ram, 2666mhz vs 3200mhz, Y540 has smaller battery 52.5wh or 57wh vs 60wh or 80wh. But y540 has gtx 1660ti",
  "You can change the refresh rate and theoretically it should improve battery performance",
  "also... where dat rgb at?",
  "I'll get back to you on the exact numbers because although I've been playing a lot of GTA V recently I never paid too much attention to the temps, but every time I glanced over at the on screen display, it always hovered at around 60-68C, take these numbers with a massive pinch of salt, I dont think me looking at temp reading once every 20 mins or so can be too accurate",
  "Nope, no problems at all",
  "10 days after ordering, it reached my doorstep",
  "No soldered ram at all, 2 empty ram slots. Ryzen supports speed up to 3200mhz for ddr4. You can put up to 32gb ram, I have a 8+8 config",
  "With Hybrid mode on, window battery saving 40% brightness, mine lasted 5hrs [I was using the Lenovo gaming mouse tho so that might had drained battery too]",
  "It's the 120hz, I dont even notice the supposed lack of color, maybe its just me. I've never had high end machines before",
  "Thermals are really good, I've played gta v and jedi fallen order at max settings and CPU never crossed 80C and GPU never crossed 68C. The screen problem is exaggerated. The reviewers need to criticize it and in terms of the specs of the screen it is very easy to bash it because it is inferior to many other laptops out there. But using it as my daily driver, I dont even notice it",
  "Nope, but no big deal for me, I can still click on the battery indicator on the taskbar and just click to on the backlight",
  "Gaming and video editing yes no problem, but if the video editing is like 4k video or very intensive stuff, I'd say upgrade the processor to the ryzen 7. The only concerns would be 8gb might not be enough for you and that a gtx 1650ti cannot run for example rdr2 at max settings at 60fps. But as for things like programming, and running virtual machines, no problem at all, unless you're running say 3 windows 10 virtual machines and all from the same HDD in which case the HDD will bottleneck really hard. I know because I just tried it yesterday, not a nice experience",
  "Uh idk I've never played sims before but I'd imagine it wont have any problems, the CPU crushes virtually everything else available, and the GPU can run pretty graphic intensive games well too",
  "Nope, when I enable caps lock only the small light in the corner lights up, I tried cycling through the backlight modes and indeed, the backlight stays off when I enable caps lock",
  "You definitely can connect an external monitor, that's what the HDMI port is for",
  "Brightness is not the best, only 250 nits. Color accuracy is 45% srgb so horrible for any content creation work but no problem for things like programming. In a well lit room I've found 50% to be okay for programming. But when it comes to like csgo, I push it to 60-70%. I have yet to use 100% brightness yet. As for the color accuracy I really cant tell you, I've never had any high quality screens before, always using budget laptops so honestly it just looks the same to me",
  "Unfortunately no",
  "Unfortunately I have no way to test this",
  "1. The laptop isnt too big for my backpack, but it is bigger than a regular 15.6 inch laptop because there is a area behind the hinges with a lot of IO ports. As for the weight it is rather heavy but there should be no problem putting it in your lap for say, a lecture.\n\n2. As for charge time I cant say, because I havent returned back to campus for lessons yet so ive been running on AC power all this time to reduce battery wear. It does support Lenovo Rapid Charge though, so it cant be slow. I can probably give you a rough estimate when I return to campus next week\n\n3. The only disadvantage I've faced is really only the weight of it. However that is the trade off for really good cooling. Like really good, I've never seen temps cross 80C even when I ran benchmarks. Other than that, probably having to readjust to this new keyboard layout. I've used 14 inch laptops my whole life so now having to ditch my, align hands to the both ends of the laptop when typing, to having to shift to the left as there is the number pad on the right. I find myself hitting the wrong keys alot during the first week of use",
  "It's installed on my SSD, I have a 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD config",
  "I got the 120hz, the 144hz was not available when I ordered it",
  "After 2 months, hinges are still perfectly okay, there are no scratches on my unit yet but there are scuff marks from the other things in my backpack rubbing against it, you could always buy a sleeve if you want to avoid this. As for battery life, I'd done a test before and posted it as replies, basically using chrome, mc word and discord video call, on 60% brightness, it lasted 2h 41mins",
  "Nope, I actually like the stickers and it's my way of flexing on my friends with their shitty intel 4 core CPUs",
  "Nope, no issues at all",
  "If you choose the rgb backlight add on, yes",
  "That's normal, mine does that too",
  "Always go for a PC over a laptop simply because a PC is upgradeable but a laptop is not. Only ever go for a laptop if you're in a situation where you need to travel and bring your work with you alot, example, student",
  "Yep, but out of my personal price range",
  "Sorry I don't play warzone, not enough space on my hard drive",
  "Yep definitely, I've run virtual machines on it and the fans were never at a noticeable volume",
  "I think I can safely say I'm the one of the first in my country to get it, I ordered it first day it went up on the lenovo website and when the website updated the shipping time from 4-6 weeks to 4 weeks, I emailed lenovo asking to clarify. The rep misunderstood me thought I was pissed off and apologized saying he'd expedite my order. Hence it ended up getting shipped just 6 days after ordering and it arrived after just 10 days on 3rd june",
  "Just that there arent many reviews out there yet, so I thought i could answer questions from any prospective buyers",
  "Yep, no issues so far apart from the wifi card not being detected at one point which was fixed with a BIOS update. \n\nNo hinge issues, build quality issues or even temp issues. I haven't cleaned it even once in these 2 years btw. Tho ofc the fan now runs noticeably louder due to that dust build up",
  "Dude these thermals are great. Holy shit.",
  "Yeah the thermals are great.",
  "You said to ask you questions",
  "U serious a 100% sRGB ? What about AdobeRGB?",
  "From the website they also show a better screen as one of the options \n \n15.6\" FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS, anti-glare, 250 nits, 120Hz, 45% CG\n\n15.6\" FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS, anti-glare, 300 nits, 60Hz, 100% sRGB\n\n **15.6\" FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS, anti-glare, 300 nits, 144Hz, 5ms response time, 100% sRGB**",
  "because you have the laptop lmao, the new legion line is a breath of fresh air from the previous one",
  "How do you think about the material of the deck? Is it durable for a long time?",
  "Thanks , I’ll check it out",
  "I already got my laptop.\nI was surprised how premium it feels given the price point. It’s an exceptional laptop for the money I guess, but I will still send it back.\n\nIt’s too heavy for my needs, even if it isn’t really heavy for a gaming laptop. I had to give it a try, and I’m honestly kind of sad as it’s a great device - just not MY device. Guess I’ll have to go back to real office laptops / Macbooks and have to refrain from additional gaming capabilities on the go.",
  "I play on an integrated graphics card, can’t even run roblox at minimum settings, i have been for years, I’m planning to get this next week, I already I’m gonna be happy with it 😂",
  "With shipping? What are your specs?",
  "Not true. For processes like gaming Intel 10rh gen still holds the throne as games are more on single core performance. Ryzen trumps Intel in multicore processes, but it does not outright beat Intel.",
  "I heard about that",
  "Can you please post a short video of you holding it, typing on it snd so we can get a feel. \nThe wait time to order get the 7i is more than 5 weeks here , I winder why ? Also I want it to last me 5 years. Also is it easy to open up the laptop and upgrade ram ? I read the ram is behind a thermal plate.",
  "Amd version has bigger battery 80wh option via double ssd config.",
  "Awesome, thank you again for the detailed feedback! This is really helpful information!",
  "Thanks for this thread.\n\nCould you elaborate on why gaming would reduce the lifespan of the machine ?",
  "Fair enough.but nobody said anything about pc master race.That in itself is an overpriced portable pc.I was talking about saving money",
  "Nice! Send the results please. Thanks!",
  "I'm surprised you don't need it at 100%. Glad to hear that :)",
  "Thx u for the info. I’m still waiting for my Legion T730 to arrive.",
  "The 5I is available but only with i5 processors",
  "I think so.",
  "Yeah I have that in the bios of my current laptop and it saves a decent amount of battery life compared to just using switchable graphics. Thanks for replying :D",
  "Thanks for your answer! LatencyMon is a application that checks if a system running Windows is suitable for processing real-time audio and other tasks. It can be downloaded for free. I attach you a link with the first side I found but there are multiple sources. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78S0CMafigM\n\nHere is a Video that explains how to use it (Just the first 3 minutes)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78S0CMafigM",
  "Wow it seems Lenovo got the thermals right unlike Dell & Asus. Please share some screenshots if you don't mind.\n\nNow I'm also excited for the Thinkpad E14. Hopefully they will not cripple the cooling system.",
  "I meant that but i have it in slovak so i translated it wrong",
  "Nice thanks for the 12am reply\n\nI'll stick with legion 5 with a ryzen 5 then (when i have more money)\n\nJust curious, whats the % / $ of student discounts (esp for urs)",
  "Damn",
  "Noted on this. Thanks for the response! :)",
  "Thanks for the reply! \n\nNow my options remain:- \nY540-60Hz-250nits-16gb -512gb SSD - i7(9th gen) - 1650 4gb \nAt around 1100 USD where I live (india) \n\nAnd the one you mentioned which might cost around more (+100) I guess..? \n\nI just do programming and run VMS so display is not a dealbreaker..\n\nWhat do you think I should do?\n\nAlso will I see a noticeable differences when running VMS between 9th & 10th gen?",
  "Can you add another SSD instead of the HD?",
  "sRGB 45%, but there are other screen options, a 60hz with 100%sRGB and a 144 hz with 100% sRGB",
  "Haha ok let me know. I have videos if you're curious how the 9th gen i7 (9750h) is in comparison. It throttles quite a lot :(  \n\nI have a cooling pad and I undervolt as well, still hits 95C sometimes. Fucking lenovo they couldn't figure out the new intel chips are a no go for laptops when they had the 8750H in there? nope took another 2 revisions with new intel chips to realize how retarded of an idea that was. fkn lenovo.   \n\n\ni shouldnt complain though, could be much worse. it took them close to a year to fix a software issue with the hotkeys.",
  "I honestly had never had experience with high end machines too, so you're saying I could get past the supposedly bad panel for gaming and watching movies? is it as dim as they say?",
  "Aight, thanks :)",
  "Is the RAM upgradable? Say for 16GB? Also the unit I'm buying has 512SSD, do you think that's enough for a college student? I'm not that informed when it comes to computer hardware sorry about that. I don't really play intensive games too but I think Overwatch is one that I play. I'm just concerned for programs like Adobe applications etc. and some games. We're on online classes too so I'm hoping if this is also a good laptop for work things yoo. Thank you!",
  "Sounds really good. Now i'm used to large 17.3\" laptops with numpad, so the keyboard probably won't be a problem for me. I think i'm gonna buy it. Thanks for the quick response!",
  "Fair enough :)",
  "Oh ok I don't need to bring it around. So I guess I will just go for a PC. Thanks, u/eatenlow",
  "I think you are also one of the first outside of China lol",
  "Hopefully mine will be be shipped as fast as yours, i ordered mine 2 days ago.  Was there an indication when they will ship the xbox one s that they are giving away with this purchase?",
  "Truly appreciate it, but my question was kinda pointing at the machine, why that. As I've been looking to replace my almost 5 year old hp laptop, I've been out of date with what's new and what's worth it given a vast price range. So I was asking why this one, what made you pull the trigger and what's different about it that caught your eye.",
  "Great to hear... I'm welling to buy legion 5 15ith6h",
  "Yeah! What's the ambient?",

  "I mean it is just a laptop at the end of the day, plus I'm sure in a few months there will be new stuff which will put mine to shame, tech moves way too fast",

  "The surface is plastic, but the inner side with the keyboard, the surface of the plastic has this slight softer, rubber ish feel to it. Id say it makes typing abit more comfortable. But as for long lasting, it seems it will last a good few years, but not if you spill liquids on it",
  "No need to feel too down, take a look at the ideapad flex 5, with the ryzen 7 4700u, the vega 7 integrated gpu isn't really all that bad, it can run GTA V smoothly albeit not at max settings",
  "Shipping was given free by lenovo, my full specs are, ryzen 7 4800h, gtx 1650, 16gb 3200mhz ddr4 ram, 256 m.2 nvme ssd, 1tb 7200rpm hdd, screen is 250 nits, 1080p, 120hz",
  "Yeah, but in my opinion, for gain of just 10fps that too when you are above 60fps it is not value enough for me to leave 20% better CPU performance with AMD.",
  "https://youtu.be/9JgefLqzfsk\n\n\nThe above is a chinese review of the same laptop but with a ryzen 5 instead, only thing is that the laptop is sold under a different name in China, skip to around 10 minutes, it shows the reviewer opening up the laptop to reveal the ram",
  "Gaming isnt what will reduce the lifespan of the machine, rather its your gaming expectations which will. Because ultimately this laptop's maximum GPU at the moment, is a GTX 1650TI, a card which isnt even seen as a high end, or top of the line card by today's standards. As time goes on, games will only get more and more demanding to run as games are all pushing towards or even past 4k 60fps. So if you are someone who wants to play games on the highest graphics settings at all times, then in a pretty short time, you will find that the laptop is no longer powerful enough for your gaming needs. Hence shortening the lifespan",
  "It's just alot of people always tell me, laptops are a waste of money, and that desktops can give way better performance etc but as a student I just need the portability. As for it being overpriced, while true to a extent, I believe spending more now means I wont have to worry about my components becoming hopelessly outdated for quite a few years, especially when I've now got the ryzen 7 4800h. Basically I see it as spend more now so I have to upgrade even less frequently",
  "Right results are in, so from 100% at 60% brightness the laptop lasts 2 hours and 41 minutes. This is running YouTube, Microsoft word and discord at the same time, I even had my webcam turned on for an hour, so without that itll probably last just about 3 hours",

  "I'm not sure about exact percent but for my order it was probably just below $200 off, I think around $180+ so probably around 10% off",
  "Personally, I feel that if you're not looking at getting the GTX 1660ti, the legion 5 is the way to go, the ryzen processor is just more powerful and consumes less power so your battery lasts longer too. As for intel 9th and 10th gen, benchmarks have shown that the difference is negligible, they basically are reselling you the same processor with a new sticker and name. Plus if you only want a 512gb ssd, you can get a free battery upgrade for the legion 5 to 80wh from 60wh\n\nI'm a IT student by the way, and I mostly run VMs and programming too, and so far, I've run 4 VMs at the same time, from kali linux to windows 10, and I can switch from one VM to another, with no lag at all, no slowdown noticed",
  "Yep, it has 2 m.2 ssd slots, if you dont want the hdd you then have the space to install 2 ssd instead",
  "RGB on keyboard i meant. did they get rid of that?",
  "Average CPU temps while playing gta online with max settings is 65C, but that's with the laptop propped up to improve air intake, so without that might be around 5C higher",
  "It's only bad for if you ever find yourself using it outdoors and it is sunny, because the screen isnt bright enough for that. But otherwise in a well lit room, 50-60% is all I need to see clearly",
  "Btw you can choose to add on if you want rgb back lighting for the keyboard, otherwise the default is just a plain white backlight",
  "The ram is upgradeable, it has 2 ram slots so you can just buy your own extra 8gb stick in the future if down the line you find 8gb to be too little. As for the storage, my opinion is that always have at least 1tb, so you got sufficient space for any games and that your storage will definitely last you a few years before you need to worry about cleaning up your files. But the legion 5 15 comes with 2 m.2 nvme slots, so once your 512 gb stick is full, you can buy another one, install it and boom more storage space. And if you're running things like photoshop and premiere pro, I'd recommend 16gb ram, especially now with online classes you probably have another video calling app open at the same time which will take up ram. As for if it's a good laptop for work? Absolutely, I'm using for my school work, no issues at all, only that it's on the heavier side. But id rather it be a little heavier than it catch on fire when I play games",
  "Fun fact, my laptop shipped out on 28th may and the sticker says manufactured date is 27th may, so you could say my laptop came super fresh",
  "I dont think I qualify because they only put up the banner on the website mentioning the free xbox was after I ordered mine so",
  "What got me was mainly the ryzen 7 4800h processor, I was actually intending to buy the Lenovo L340 gaming instead initially until this appeared on the lenovo store, the 8 cores the ryzen 7 4800h has allows me to do a lot of multi tasking work smoothly. Plus it comes with a gtx 1650 which would allow me to play the few games that interest me and also allow me to continue playing games quite a few years down the line even as games get more demanding, as I dont have high expectations or requirements for graphics. Finally was the price, in my country, this legion 5 15 cost the same as the L340 gaming when both are customized to equivalent specs, and the fact the ryzen 7 4800h has 8 cores vs the 6 cores in the i7 9750h, and can support faster ram, 3200mhz vs 2666mhz, and also sports the latest intel wifi 6 card which allows for maximum wifi speeds, something the L340 gaming didnt have. \n\n\nOf course this does beg the question of why didnt I look at say ASUS who also had laptops carrying the new ryzen 4000 series processors, that's because the ASUS TUF series firstly has cooling issues, and according to the asus rep in my country, isn't gonna be in stock for the foreseeable future. Plus other companies like Dell with the new xps laptops, sell at a very steep mark up in my country, therefore making it no longer value for money.\n\nSo in conclusion, I bought it because based on everything available I felt it gave me the best performance per dollar, and was within my budget",

  "Problem is that I emailed asus asking about the A15 and the zephyrus G14, but the rep said that neither will be in stock in my country for the foreseeable future, plus in my country, computers in general are sold at marked up prices compared to in the usa so paying the price I did is actually considered a massive steal in my country",
  "What kind of modifications were you talking about?",
  "Yes, they are trying to compete ,that's why they are still better in single core performance.",
  "It feels sturdy and robust, but it is on the heavy side too. As for using it for business, definitely possible, it is much more subtle and quiet looking from the outside compared to the likes of asus where its flooded with flashing lights and RGB. All it has is a iridescent Legion logo and that's it, other than that just pure black",
  "Personally I just dont like asus, because every time I go to a tech fair, asus always charges more than lenovo for similarly spec laptops, if you're interested in a slim laptop, you can take a look at the lenovo ideapad 5 AMD version, it sports the new AMD 4000 series processors, but a low power version so you get much better battery life, but it is capable of boosting its speed when under load so no need to worry about lack of performance, and it is relatively cheap, only thing is it doesnt have any dedicated GPU",
  "Which listing did you click on in the lenovo store, theres the regular legion 5 15 and a legion 5 15 build it yourself or sth like that, choose the regular one, for some reason the listing which is meant for complete customization gives me a higher price for my exact same configuration",
  "The legion 5 at the moment only has up to a GTX 1650ti, but Lenovo said that they will have up to RTX 2060 coming later in the year\n\nThe default is 60wh, you must make sure to choose that you do not want a HDD, the legion 5 has 2 drives, so choose your 512 gb SSD, then choose no hard drive for the second and the battery will automatically change to a 80wh battery\n\nDont let the pipes fool you, the thermals for the legion 5 is amazing, I've run jedi fallen order on it on epic settings, and the cpu never exceeded 80C and GPU never exceeded 68C, but that is with the laptop propped up off the table which does improve the airflow to the intake vents",
  "Generally yes, propping up the laptop will improve temps slightly. That's because most laptops' rubber feel simply dont lift the laptop high enough to allow good airflow through the intake vent at the bottom. So usually the restricted intake does have an effect on high temps",
  "Nice, how much was the total cost after the discount?\nI was actually about to just have the ryzen 5 4600h but after applying the student discount, suddenly now my budget could allow for the cpu upgrade so I went for it",

  "only the build it yourself option shows up for me. talking to the service rep, he said they're only offering a 5% student discount on that product at this time. \n\ni ended up getting a sgd1709 config (after -90 for student) because they're also running a free xbox one s offer if you spend >1500 on legion? random ass offer but i figure i can recoup some cash by selling that thing.\n\nanyway thanks for the info, this thread helped me make my purchase decision!",

  "sorry my guy thats a different brand i dont own a asus grand laptop, but the legion pro not to expensive as the other brands and performance and thermals are great for longevity",
  "No coil whine and I don't believe this one has liquid metal, so no leakage issues there. Overall, it's been great. The build quality is pretty solid, but it's not as good as the MacBook or the Razer Blade I had. However, Razer got rid of the glass on their displays, which has led to them feeling lower quality to me, and lesser in comparison to the Macs that still use glass. The bottom panel is a cheap plastic one which again, feels lesser in quality vs those other two, but it's not something I notice in my regular usage because it's either docked or on a desk and then going in and out of a bag. \n\nIt has a minor issue on the trackpad, but it's still very usable, just annoying. Since I rarely use the trackpad and use external M&K when at home, or a mouse and the built-in keyboard while traveling, it's not a big deal. \n\nPerformance-wise, I'm still able to max out all of my games on absolutely Ultra settings including Path Tracing on Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2 with good frame rates on my external 34\" Ultrawide. When playing on the 2560x1600 internal display, performance is obviously even better. \n\nI bought this because I needed the absolute most power possible in the lightest, most portable package possible. I traveled for work weekly for the past few years, and I travel regularly, so having this has been a godsend. I remember playing Warzone in LaGuardia at one of the bars when my flight got delayed and blowing off steam was great. I took this to QuakeCon for 3 years now, and the ability to pack more power than my desktop into something that fits in my backpack is amazing.  \n\nComing from a Mac, probably your biggest hurdle is going to be battery life, but the latest CPUs are supposedly much better in that regard (though we hear that every generation so YMMV).",

  "Remove the screw aand replace it with the shorter one the tech was suppose dto have used, then you can take a Bic lighter and heat the spot up and press it down once the plastice is pliable, should only take a few sconds of flame to heat it up enough, then use the sloped side of the lighter to pres the plastic down. It won't be perfect but it's an easy fix.",

  "There you go.",
  "Ah yup they put a screw that was too long in the wrong place. I would take it back to the person who did the battery repair.",
  "That tech had to be a noob. Remove the screw, find the short one at either the midway or back side, and swap them, then roll over the spot with the round part of a spoon and some force, and you can usually get it very nearly back to normal.",

Not sure why the plastic broke in that particular manner, didn’t even notice it was gone until it happened. Poor molding, maybe?",
  "This is 100% what happened. I've seen it done before on many a HP computer.",

  "Is this Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 the right price? Hi,\n\nI am about to place an order for this laptop and I would like to hear from those of you more in touch with the laptop market if this looks like a good price for the configuration below:\n\nLenovo Ideapad Slim 3 15AHP10\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS\n\nRAM: 16GB DDR5 5600MHz (dual channel)\n\nStorage: 1TB SSD M.2\n\nDisplay: 15.3\" IPS, 1920x1200 (WUXGA)\n\nBacklit keyboard\n\nBattery: 60 Wh\n\nPrice in EUR: €600\n\nI haven't bought a laptop in many years, as I mainly work and play on a desktop, but I wanted something relatively compact to take with me while traveling this summer, maybe even do some remote work away from the heat of the big city, play an occasional game, nothing too demanding (Skyrim-level games, so to speak)..., yet not too small (14\") either, as I work with documents and text and I do need some decent display area.\n\nAre there other good choices in this price range?

I don't need OLED, just a good decently accurate and colorful IPS.",
  "I avoided a 2-in-1 for the same reason, as I had been reading about the issues with their hinges; are the regular non 2-in-1s just as bad? \n\nI had a chance to see the Slim 3 today in a showroom and it feels kind of flimsy.. the keyboard is nothing like the ThinkPads I owned, it feels soft/rubberized, with a lot of flex.. the keyboard is almost level with the laptop's surface, not enough travel for good feedback.. I'm considering a Thinkpad, even if with a less powerful CPU, but I haven't seen the newer generations, they may just as well not be the same quality as the older ones...",
  "Hi,\n\nYes, I ended up buying it because I could no longer bear all the browsing and comparing and reading reviews... :)\n\nI had used Thinkpads before, and a year ago I had bought the Ideapad 1 for my daughter to use as her first laptop in school, so I was not totally unfamiliar with Lenovo laptops.\n\nWhat can I say, it is kind of what I expected, build quality seems decent, with an aluminium lid, solid plastic/PCB for the rest of the body, and yes, it is very slim, at least compared to what I had been used to. It doesn't look cheap, I got it in Luna Grey, and it's a very nice metallic color, making it look more expensive than it is.\n\nThe display is the regular WUXGA 1920x1200 which for me is perfect in such a compact form factor (it is a 15.3\" display - which I appreciate for portability, while still offering plenty of space for work thanks to its 16:10 ratio). It is \"only\" 300 nits bright, some people complained about it being too dim for them, but I found it perfectly fine, I use it comfortably at 70-75% brightness (my desktop Dell monitor is only 250 nits and it it is still bright enough!)\n\nPerformance-wise it is as expected from a Ryzen 7 8840HS - snappy in all tasks, it won't get hot with regular office work, browsing, watching videos, etc. So far, so good. The fan only starts with some heavy multitasking, such as downloading and installing a large game while also running online tv in the background and working in Office at the same time... but even so, the fan is not loud at all, you can barely hear it.\n\nI've tested it in some games too, again.. it performs as expected, the integrated Radeon 780M is excellent for \"laptop gaming\", it runs games like Syrim, Fallout New Vegas, etc. perfectly smooth in 1080p (or 1200p for that matter). Of course the very slim case is not optimal for cooling, so for extended gaming, even moderate, I would suggest an additional cooler pad/stand. \n\nOtherwise, I'm pretty happy with it, no issues so far.. if I were to be really picky, I'd say the keyboard could be better, it feels a bit soft for my taste, somewhat rubbery. But the backlight is really useful in dark conditions, and I knew I shouldn't expect a \"Thinkpad level keyboard\". I often work on an external monitor, using an external keyboard, so that is not a serious issue for me anyway.\n\nShortly after I bought it, the price was discounted and I could have gotten the 24GB RAM version instead of the 16GB version, for the same price, but I didn't bother trying to return it and order the one with more RAM, I intend to upgrade it to more than 24GB anyway. I intend to add a 32GB DDR5 stick (in addition to the 8GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard) - a total of 40GB should be plenty for the next few years - the added RAM will really be necessary (especially with the integrated GPU), so I would recommend getting the one with more RAM if you don't plan to upgrade it yourself later.\n\n(I would post photos, but I don't think it's possible here.)",
  "The max it can use is 4GB, I don't think you can change that in BIOS (I don't remember seeing any options related to vram allocation). \n\nIn the meantime I upgraded mine to 24GB RAM (8 soldered + a 16GB DDR5 5600MHz stick). Running Task Manager I can see there are always a total of 20GB available for system, thus the rest of 4GB is reserved for the GPU, which is allocated dynamically in games as needed (you can see all those stats live using the in-game overlay provided by the AMD Adrenalin software).",
  "It's not a heavy duty workstation, it's not meant to be \"overloaded\" with work. For regular office work, for students and even for some light-medium gaming it does work well, it doesn't feel sluggish at all. After all, it is an 8 cores, 16 threads, 5.1 GHz boost clock CPU! And the RAM is DDR5 running at 5600MHz! So it's by no means a slow machine, but you really have unrealistic expectations, what does \"value for money\" mean in this case? The performance of a $3,000 laptop in one that costs $600?\n\nThere are two battery versions available for this model, I went for the higher capacity one (60Whr). Coupled with a low TDP of the CPU (only 28W!), the battery really lasts more than many laptops I owned before.",
  "It depends... which Ryzen 5 CPU? The \"U\" versions of the Ryzen 5 CPUs are cheaper (but also slower, such as Ryzen 5 5625U).\n\nAnd what display? The regular IPS lcd, OLED...?\n\nBut £450 seems a bit expensive, for instance I found this configuration online in my country for about £350 (with further 10% off these days):\n\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15ARP10\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 7533HS (up to 4.4GHz)\n\n15.3\" WUXGA, IPS\n\n16GB DDR5\n\n512GB SSD\n\nI'm pretty sure it does the job for uni, office work, etc.\n\n  \nP.S> Oh, and do go for the highest RAM version (I think they come with a maximum of 24GB), it will help a lot for the future, even if all you do is regular work and study, Windows itself and other software are becoming more and more demanding in terms of memory. The price difference is not that much.\n\n#",
  "Hi, mine is the 60 Wh battery (they larger capacity one) and while I haven't used it exclusively on battery yet, from full to empty, it always shows an estimate of 6-7 hours when I unplug it at full charge. It automatically switches to another power plan for better battery life, which you can adjust further manually for even more battery saving, but I guess it also depends on what kind of work you're doing on your laptop while running on battery and the brightness you set for the display. I'd say you can definitely rely on approximately 6 hours of normal office work, browsing, etc. No gaming on battery, obviously.",
  "I only use it occasionally, when I travel or when I spend the weekend away from home and so. No issues so far, it is (obviously) faster than my desktop's i5-9500 / 32GBRAM and I've even played some games, I happy with the performance and the compact size. I've adjusted the display colors to a cooler temperature as the \"built-in\" blue light protection makes the colors slightly too warm by default.",
  "way better. the steam deck has 4 zen2 cores at max 3.5ghz with a 8cu rdna2 igpu, the 8840hs has 8 zen 4 cores at max 5.1ghz with a 16cu 780m rdna3 igpu. also higher tdp",

  "Honestly I really don't know. Everythime it is a surprise when you switch on a new PC. Acer Aspire was good but I have been struggling since the beginning with Touchpad glitches, often it does not work. I think I will give up with PC and buy a Mac At least it lasts forever and no surprises.",
  "Just as bad, the hinges in Ideapads 1 and 3 are painfully weak, also tbh not that many laptops can compare to Thinkpad in terms of reliability. You probably should go with some thinkpad if your budget is limited and under 500$\n\nIf you take T or P Thinkpads, they'll serve you good, new or old ones",
  "Am also in same situation,  I shortlisted this an  Thinkpad with R77735HS",
  "Thanks for taking the time to write this, you really covered everything. I'm also, tired of searching, comparing models and reading reviews... I think I'll buy this one after all, it's also on discount (549€).",
  "Thanks so much for the detailed answer!",
  "i was looking for reviews of this product everywhere, thanks for this. i am also looking at the 24 ram variant.",
  "Hi man thanks for the review.About Display did you find it to have a yellowish tint as many say?!",
  "How are the thermals? What temperature does the cpu reach while playing?",
  "Hi, the display does show a slightly warm/yellowish tint overall, particularly noticeable with reds - they look somewhat orange, I suspect it's the so called blue light filter built in, but I used the Adrenalin software for the integrated GPU and managed to get reasonably neutral/cooler colors, it now looks similar to my desktop monitor, but if you are a perfectionist, you may need to invest more. But to me, it's not a bad display at all.",
  "What do you think about the new Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Gen 10?  Ryzen AI 7 350, OLED and 32Gb RAM for 900€ ",
  "I have one but with sadly a ryzen 7 7735hs and not an AI 7 350. But I have all maxed out options.\n\nIt's an absolute BANGER of a laptop. It's very light and thin, build quality is pretty good and the OLED is really bright. \n\nPerformance wise it performs as you'd expect from the specs as far as mine is concerned, but i can't tell for the RAI7 version obviously. \n\nKeyboard is good as well. The integrated microphone is *extremely* good for a laptop, hands down best laptop mic I've heard. I'm running Linux on it, it's very well supported and everything works as expected except the mic which needs a kernel edit to work (I've sent a patch a month or so ago, but i think it got forgotten :/ )\n\nIn the bios you can dedicate from 256mb to 4gb to the igpu. However the bios is fairly limited in terms of what you can do in it.\n\nNow that I know the ryzen ai 7 version exists I'm sad I didn't wait :( \n\nOh and one last thing, at least with mine I bundled a 2year accidental damage warranty for 35€ which is nice, idk if that's still available but it's a nice to know.",

  "Hi,\n\nYeah for sure. Still a great laptop. I'd recommend getting the OLED screen if your budget allows for it, it's really worth it in my opinion. Also since the memory is non upgradable getting the 32 gigs of ram is not a bad idea either (and if you can't get both the oled and the ram, get the ram) especially if you're running windows",

I get 5 because I’m always on HDR at 120hz with the ram set to 7500MT/s (they added a setting in the bios to change it), but I remember getting closer to 7 hours before I did all that, even 8.

  "Old ones okay maybe if decently priced. Problem are new ones, being super overpriced while offering very little. An example : A mid range T14 G5 with a core ultra 5 125U, 60hz 1200p sRGB IPS display, 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage, which for those two are getting below today's standard, is priced at 1200€. Those are specs you'd find on a 600-700€ laptop, not a 1200€ laptop. At 1000€ you can already get something well built with a Ryzen 7 8th gen, 32gb of ram and 1tb of storage (Asus Zenbook, HP Elitebook, etc). In this case that laptop OP showed was a pretty fine deal, but if you took a Thinkpad for the same price you'd have an E14 Gen 6 with even worse specs. They stay good, don't get me wrong : but at any price range there's pretty much always a better deal.",

  "Keyboard's alright. As for the burn in, I think it'll be fine, especially if you don't run max brightness (the screen is very bright, even half brightness is much brighter than most laptop screens) and auto hide taskbar. Bonus point if you use a OLED friendly theme (iirc the O365 suite has one where the background and ui is pure black). Those are only preventive measures and not really 100% necessary unless you're really scared.",

  "The ai 7 350 has a weaker iGPU but is normally slightly better than the 8845hs, would be close or even better since it also consumes less.",
  "Eh, won’t affect much.",
  "Lenovo Yoga 7i Gen10, 14-inch laptop (2025) review **UK-based Laptop Review**\n\n**1. Title:**  \nLenovo Yoga 7i Gen 10 (2025) Review: power and portability\n\n**2. Introduction:**\n\nThis is a review for the 2025 yoga 7i gen 10 model from Lenovo with intel core ultra 7 258v and 14 inch screen. I bought the configuration from the UK Lenovo website with 32GB RAM, 1TB SDD, 2.8k OLED 120Hz screen, Luna Grey colour and optioned the fingerprint scanner for an additional £10, paying £1090 in total (including the 10% VIP discount for healthcare workers). This is a premium grade 2-in-1 consumer laptop with a solid build, great for anyone who needs a portable and powerful device.\n\nI haven’t seen many user reviews for this particular generation of laptop so thought it would be useful for anyone considering it.\n\n**3. Design and Build Quality:**\n\nThe chassis all metal, which gives it a very solid feel. The build quality is great, there’s very little flex in the case or the keyboard. The body does not pick up fingerprints. At 1.4kg, it’s not the lightest laptop but it’s still very portable. It fits my 13 inch laptop sleeve. I don’t have much use for the tablet mode as I find it too cumbersome when compared with holding an actual tablet. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and the trackpad is smooth and accurate. I appreciate the double height enter key. Coming from the LG gram 16, this is a much better typing and trackpad experience.\n\nPort selection is good. There are 2 USB-C ports, one on either side, with one USB-A, one full-sized HDMI, a microSD card slot and a headphone jack. The power key is on the right side which I’ve mis-pressed a couple of times so I’ve disabled it in the settings.\n\nThe display is a 14-inch glossy OLED touchscreen with 2.8K resolution (2880 x 1800), 500 nits brightness (1100 nits HDR Peak). I find the screen bright and vibrant. Watching video in a dimmed room is fantastic with zero light bleed. Reflections and fingerprints can be an issue, especially when viewing dark things on the screen and there is bright ambient. However it is still useable under these conditions.\n\nThe hinges are solid, with little screen wobble when typing but it does require two hands to open the lid. The look and feel of the laptop is very nice with smooth rounded outer edges.\n\n**4. Performance and heat:**\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 258v is perfectly capable of handling my usual tasks of multiple Chrome/ Firefox tabs, connecting to my remote desktop for work and steaming video content.  I have tried some gaming and the experience with casual  games has been very good. Fortnite runs at 120FPS. Cities Skylines runs great. I’ve tried playing Watchdogs and although it could play it, the framerates were only around 40fps and the processor got quite hot with the fans getting noisy.\n\nThe keyboard and palm rest areas are always cool. The area under the screen gets warm under load but the hot air is blown out through the vents on the back, away from the user which is a good design.\n\n**5. Audio and Webcam:**\n\nThe speakers are fine, they are up firing from the sides of the keyboard and they are rated for Dolby Atmos. I can clearly hear the 3D effects when watching YouTube or Netflix. There isn't much bass but it is acceptable for a thin and light laptop.\n\nThe 5M IR camera is decent for video conferencing. There is a privacy shutter switch just above the camera. Windows Hello usually takes just a few seconds to log me in. I have found the fingerprint scanner works faster, especially when the lighting conditions are not ideal for Windows Hello.\n\n**6. Battery Life:**\n\nThe 70WHr battery lasts all day for me when web browsing/ streaming videos. I use a 100W Ugreen 4-port USB C charger to charge all my devices and the laptop fully charges within a couple of hours.  \n\n**7. Software and User Experience:**\n\nThe OS is Windows 11 Home 64 and comes with some minor bloatware including McAffee Antivirus, Lenovo support/ vantage/ AI shenanigans. The Lenovo Vantage software has some useful features including dimming various parts of the screen to save battery – I only use the taskbar dimming though as I find the background dimming too distracting. It also enables you to switch the laptop on just by lifting the lid, which means the much maligned side power switch is hardly ever used. There have been reports of this power button breaking easily on other models and thus bricking the device.\n\n**8. Price and Value:**\n\nThe base model costs £1000 (£900 for students or those that qualify for VIP member) and comes with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and a14inch WUXGA OLED screen (1920x1200, 400nits, 60Hz). I was happy to pay the \\~£200 premium for the better spec’d screen with double the RAM and SSD. Mine came with a 65W USB-C charger and a stylus pen which magnetically attaches to the lid.\n\n**9. Pros and Cons:**\n\n* **Pros:** Screen, performance, battery life, keyboard\n* **Cons:** Screen reflections, power key positioning.\n\n**10. Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a well-built laptop where the pros far out-weigh the cons. The OLED screen is fantastic and it has been a pleasure watching content in a darkened room. It is very easy to travel with, having all-day battery life and a thin and light form factor.\n\n**Final Rating:** 9/10",
  "Really nice post.\n\nIm looking into this as pretty much the only option as the price is really good compared to others.\n\nIm sceptical about the hinges, but you say they are fine. And also if the performance is okay, if i could spec it id go higher but there arent really any options. \n\nThe next thing is vivobook which goes about 50% more with worse screen",
  "How about the weight, does it feel heavy...do you think it's worth the penny and do you think it's a good investment until 2028 atleast?",
  "Im setting up my 16 inch model right now and the fans are running on low constantly and high pitch too, did yours do the same?",
  "Hey, I am curious how did you opt for the fingerprint scanner. I can't find it in the configurations. Thanks.",
  "Potentially stupid question...\n\nI'm comparing different Lenovo Yoga 7s on their website,  and nowhere does it say which generation is which... How do you guys know this information?\n\nThere's so many reviews out there 😵‍💫",
  "I'm thinking of getting this laptop but I'm wondering about the CPU performance for things like python and matlab number crunching(data/optimization/small simulations etc)\n\nJust curious what kind of work do you do on it and is the CPU fast enough for that? I'm still not sure whether the lesser multicore compared to a 200H arrow lake is a problem or if I'm overthinking about the 258V",
  "hello, here some questions:\n1. what version of hdmi port does it have?\n2. What components could you upgrade? ssd, battery, keyboard?",
  "Just a question: does the screen have a plastic border, or is it all glass? ",
  "[removed]",
  "Hi OP, I read a few other reddit posts regarding poor battery life on this particular screen option (2.8K) compared to alot of the youtube reviews (which seems to be based on the 1200 screen option). When you say all day do you mean \\~7 hours? Are you leaving your screen on 120Hz or reducing it to 60Hz.",
  "Hi, I’ve used a Lenovo Yoga 7 AMD from a few generations back with the Ryzen 6800U for the past 3 years and have had no issues with the hinges for what it’s worth!",
  "Thanks. Only time will tell regarding the hinges but they look and feel sturdy to me and these double hinge designs should in theory spread the force out across the 4 contact points on each hinge, reducing the stress at any one point. I'll update if I have any problems with the hinges",
  "It doesn't feel heavy but it's not feather-light like the LG gram. The LG gram can be lifted from a corner with one hand easily whereas I'd struggle to do this with the Yoga 7i. The Yoga 7i   feels more substantial, more premium. However it is still easy to carry around in a back pack.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase so far - it does everything I need and I feel it is good value for what you get compared to an equivalent from HP or Apple. As long as I keep the battery in good condition and the hinges don't break, I'm sure it'll last a good 3-5 years. \n\nIf I didn't play PC games, I would have strongly considered a macbook air 13\".",
  "The 14 inch model doesn't have this problem at all. It's mostly silent. Your 16 inch model should have even better thermal handling given the extra space. The constant fans might be due to all the updates being installed, see how it goes",
  "It came up as an option for me when I selected luna grey as the colour",
  "https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-pro-series/lenovo-yoga-pro-7i-gen-10-aura-edition-14-inch-intel/len101y0058\n\nIt can be confusing. The UK lenovo website states which gen it is,  the i is for Intel, they usually have AMD in brackets for AMD models. X means snapdragon. I think the gen 10s are sometimes called Aura Edition too",
  "1. The HDMI port is a standard sized 1.4b\n\n2. The SSD can be upgraded via the M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe SSD slot but that's about it. The RAM is soldered on the model I got.",
  "There is a black border around the screen but the glass extends over it. The border houses the web cam",
  "I turned off the side power button and activated the open screen to switch on option which works really well. It means I never accidentally mis-press the power button and it should last a lot longer",
  " battery life has been fine for me, I've kept it at 120Hz and only charge up to 80%. Off power, I've been using it for 5 hours now, browsing/ streaming at 50% screen brightness and there's still 45% remaining, so that's just 35% battery use after 5 hours of light usage. I would expect at least 12 hours from a fully charged battery",
  "So pc games work on this one? How is the performance, which games did you try out and does it heat up?",
  "Do you still see that option? Cause I don't see it when I want to configure it",
  "Interesting... Yea the Canadian site doesn't mention generation. We have all those versions though.",
  "yea the cpu and size are all included in the full model name, but aura edition stands for the optimized intel partnerships versions that have slightly better battery life and perfs",
  "Is it possible to replace the keyboard?",
  "Awesome. Thank you ",
  "[removed]",
  "Whats the thought behind charging to 80% - does this extend overall battery life long-term?",
  "Yes, you can play PC games. Fortnite runs at 100-120FPS on the native screen resolution. Cities Skylines plays well.  I wouldn't expect to be able to run the latest AAA 3D intensive games well, but it can run most of them on low settings but I wouldn't recommend it for that as the fan noise gets quite loud if pushed too hard.",
  "Yes, it's still there as an option on the Lenovo UK website for the Lenovo Yoga 7i",
  "You would have to replace the entire assembly including touchpad",
  "I've used the laptop for a few months now and on the rare occasion that I do need to use the side power button (maybe twice so far), it's worked as it should. I think if the usage of the power button is so low, it should easily last the entire life of the laptop",
  "Yes, it's an option in the power management software to prolong battery health. It's standard practice for all lithium batteries",
  "After my 7yo Asus laptop borked on me, I finally got a new boy last night! Lenovo Legion 5 (AMD) ",
  "How much did this cost?",
  "Before you ask about the config I have, here it is, and no it's not customized online because my mom has trust issues when it comes to buying laptops online. My brother-in-law bought this for me because he knows that I wanted a new laptop for like 5 years... I originally wanted a Ryzen 5 4600H version but too bad no stock for it so I ended up with Ryzen 7 4800H variant instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpecs of this laptop (only top model sold locally in Malaysia):\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 4800H @ 2.90 GHz (8C/16T)\n\nGPU: Integrated AMD Radeon graphics + discrete NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\nRAM: 8GB of DDR4-3200\n\nStorage: 512GB M.2 NVMe SSD\n\nDisplay: 15.6 inch FHD 1080p IPS with 120Hz refresh rate and 45% NTSC (250 nits)\n\nBattery: 60Wh\n\nPrice: RM3999 (approximately \\~USD$960, \\~SGD$1312, INR14.05M, \\~₹71362,)",
  "Nice wallpaper",
  "Imagine holding a presentszion and then accidently getting onto ur desktop and the whole class seed that background lmao",
  "i didn't know your laptop was a dog🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔",
  "hey my brother just got that one!",
  "You know, that company has lost all creditibilty when a few years ago they had installed rootkits (trojans) with their default Windows installation.\n\nI would never buy a Lenovo laptop for this reason.\n\nThey had a good reputation and they chose to ruin it to steal data from your laptop and use your laptop for whatever unknown purposes.\n\nLenovo is not a trustworthy company since that incident.",
  "Based on the pricing i assume you’re a malaysian too! How long did it take for it to arrive? And is it custom built. ;-; been dreading to get one due to the 6-8 weeks of delivery",
  "You can turn that watermark in the bottom left corner off if you want",
  "Just got this same one probably around the same price. Good laptop. Second Lenovo laptop since the first one is still holding up nicely",
  "Amd hype! So much for the money.",
  "Hello a fellow Xiaomi user! (Checked the watermark lol)\nAlso nice laptop",
  "Hey I have the same laptop! I love your wallpaper too 😊",
  "Aaaaand there it is, Microsoft Edge, the pesky damn thing!",
  "Planning to get this boi",
  "Is it better than hp omen 15?",
  "[removed]",
  "I'm looking at  the pic of your Legion 5 on my Legion 5",
  "Your wallpaper please!!",
  "I've retired my PC into this laptop, and really surprised with the advancements in the laptop world nowadays Mine is upgraded to 32GB 3200Mhz ram, and two 512 NVMEs. Damn crazy laptop this one is.",
  "Man i wish they released this in India :/",
  "I see, a cultured honkai player",
  "Hi there! What’s the battery life so far?",
  "Hey i heard that the 250 nits display isnt bright enough,  have you faced any issues with the screen brightness while using it at home?",
  "How’re the thermals? Planning to buy this exact one 😌",
  "how is it now? after about 22 days? i’m planning on getting this one",
  "the keyboard is only white, or is rgb?",
  "Kinda late but how’s the build? Any issues that you’ve seen?",
  "Anyone worried about backdoors on Lenovo laptops? I mean they're not Huawei but they're still a big company with headquarters in Beijing ...\n\nObviously OC doesn't have to worry since he/she's in China anyway (and uses a Xiaomi phone)",
  "Costs RM3999 (approximately USD$960) for a 4800H and GTX 1650 variant with 120Hz panel which is not the greatest deal since my brother-in-law bought this for me which is nice of him.",
  "How do you like the weight? Wondering if this is alright for schoolwork or if something like an Ideapad 5 is better for portability. I'm considering it for my little brother for his starting at university.",
  "Thanks! Here is the wallpaper source if you wanted it: \nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/82467485",
  "That'll be funny af",
  "Reminds me about that time my friend decided to use a history presentation that was supposed to be about the effects of the Second World War on japan and just made it into a presentation about anime.\n\nas someone who is half Japanese, I wanted to kill him for the amount of cringe he made me feel",
  "LOL I intentionally said it",
  "Nice, hope your brother likes it as much as I did!",
  "Well, if there is a backdoor, I would nuke my OEM install and clean install Windows 10 Pro on it. But man, it can be concerning if people stored the most important data on their Lenovo laptop that still has OEM install.",
  "Well that's the config I got locally because most of the time, my mom doesn't trust buying very expensive stuff online... (and yes 1650 config is only GPU config available locally)",
  "I know but I'd leave it on for now :)",
  "Meanwhile this laptop is my third Lenovo laptop in the fleet alongside two Lenovo netbooks. The S10-3 netbook was a sentimental netbook that somehow survived the pretty big Pepsi spill...",
  "Lenovo hold up quite well. I have a Lenovo which almost decade or so older. With AMD A4 Radeon graphics 2.5 ghz and with only 2 gb ram and i still dsy trade with that. Hit me with a brick",
  "Yes, as a long time Intel Ivy Bridge user, this is definitely worth my savings for one of these.",
  "Thanks!",
  "Thanks! :D",
  "I use Firefox anyway, I manually installed Chromium based Edge cuz why not :v",
  "It's really hard for me to recommend though since both Lenovo Legion 5 and HP Omen 15 2020 are solid options, just that the Omen can go up to 1660 Ti, while Legion 5 can go up to 1650 Ti at the moment.",
  "Thanks, and yeah I have no regrets putting weeb background on my computers ;;",
  "nice :D",
  "That's...an insane upgrade! I was hoping to upgrade mine if I save up enough for them!",
  "LOL I don't even play Honkai but I just put this as a wallpaper cuz it's cool ;p",
  "Not an issue for me, since I usually use a laptop at an adequately low brightness settings anyway.",
  "Been doing some video rendering, gaming and then benchmark the crap out of it, and so far I can feel that it ran warm on the chassis itself. This laptop has a solid thermal performance despite only 3 heatpipes which should on par with Omen 15 2020.",
  "Well what can I say? It served me well, the 1650 GPU surprisingly never reached above 60 degrees when I do graphics testing like running Unigine and playing games.\nDefinitely a solid machine although AMD is quirky in terms of graphics driver, plus 1650 is weak in terms of gaming. I recommend going for 1660 Ti variant if it's available in your region.",
  "I have RGB on mine.",
  "I got like freezing issues sometimes on EUCN22WW BIOS version and after updating the EUCN28WW BIOS version, the problem went away.\nOtherwise, I have no issues with it so far. No thermal issues whatsoever during gaming and video editing, despite the one annoying issue that is fixable with BIOS update. (But yeh, i won't dare to do bios update on my main machine again)",
  "Well actually I'm Malaysian",
  "[removed]",
  "Oh cool",
  "Pretty heavy during my first impression at around 2.5 kilos, but it's enough for me to travel around.",
  "The weight of the laptop is pretty Ok. It is on the heavy side but its a gaming laptop so you should expect this.... but only downside I think is the power brick is so damn huge to lug around.",
  "Thanks!",
  "Thank you",
  "It could be worse",
  "Please tell me he didnt try to say something in japanese",
  "Ah understandable. I’m tempted due to it being cheaper online as compared to in stores.:) thank you though!",
  "Enjoy it😃it's really nice👍",
  "👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",
  "I'll say from my experience so far I think you are going to like it",
  "RAM prices are cheap nowadays, for some workloads, having more ram is a bliss. Besides, the old rams can be sold to subsidize the upgrade :)  \nThe only minus with these ryzen laptops is the thunderbolt.  \nOtherwise, I wouldn't need to upgrade for a long time after this legion 5.",
  "Oh sorry 😬",
  "I mostly use it at home so it's a non-issue.",
  "Anytime (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧",
  "Time to change to a hentai background",
  "He said “It made anime baka” \n\nI wanted to die",
  "You're welcome! ;)",
  "U can still buy it online its estimated 6-8 weeks but most users can get it within 2-3 weeks",
  "Thank you! (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧",
  "I like it already, performs far better than my old laptop with Core i5-3210M. Going from dual-core to octa-core is way overkill for me but hope it served me well!",
  "[removed]",
  "177013",
  "Dear god...",
  "Have a lovely day",
  "Nitro 5 2020 AMD is a value champ but the aesthetics are gamery for me, however Acer Malaysia released the Intel version of Nitro 5 2020 first. Legion 5/5i however looks clean and no red accents anywhere. If you don't mind about gamery aesthetics, Nitro 5 2020 is definitely it, but if you want a gaming laptop without any red accents, Legion 5 is definitely it.",
  "Yes perfection",
  "Are you fine with the 120hz display? I read somewhere that it has only ~58% sRGB whereas the 144hz has almost 100%. There is a big difference in price in my country so I am asking if it's worth it.",
  "Yeah I am fine with 120Hz display since I don't use it under bright sunlight anyway. 144Hz panel is the recommended option for both productivity and gaming. 120Hz panel on this was fine for gaming.",
  "Yeah, the brightness is fkine indoors so I am not worried about that. My main concern is the color gamut, since it's supposed to be only ~58% sRGB. What do you think about the colors? I will use it for post-processing and photoshop among some other things like gaming so I need the colors to be good. Is the 58% good enough or should I pay extra for better colors?",
  "Good enough for gaming, not for color sensitive work.",
  "My Lenovo Legion 5 15 has arrived! :D ",
  "Have fun, I'm typing from mine right now! I \"needed one for work\" because they don't let us have administrator access on our office PCs.",
  "Off topic but is your thumb OK? lol  \nCongrats btw",
  "Nice .🎉🎉",
  " thank you for the unboxing experience, enriched my evening \\^\\_\\^",
  "Specs?",
  "Congrats! It looks sleek as hell dude.",
  "How's the display?",
  "Can you disable optimus with that?",
  "Does it have Type-C charging and camera shutter doohickey?",
  "[deleted]",
  "Congrats mister",
  "How long did it take to arrive? I'm about to order a 5 pro but the website says 2+ months to deliver. Currently considering the options",
  "I just ordered this same one, arrives Wednesday. What do you think of yours now that you've had it a couple weeks?",
  "Why does it have a Raedon Sticker ( in the fourth Image ). I thought the specks said an RTX 3050Ti.",
  "Nice, does it have a metal chassis? It's beautiful.",
  "what that thumb do tho?",
  "Loved your thumbs up. It just shows how genuinely happy you are! Congrats man!",
  "Probably going to buy one of these later in the summer for \"work\"",
  "Watching other people succeed in life sure make my day better, even though I cant afford something but just get to see other people buy the thing that i need it enough. By the way sick laptop. I'm proud for you",
  "good for you",
  "Nice! What's the backlight bleed like? My Legion 5 has a bit of bleed mainly near the right hinge. Also does it always run with the fans on even on idle? Mine does even on the quiet power mode. I haven't found a way to adjust the fan curve yet. Not that it's loud, can't even hear it during the day but it's still a bit bothersome when I'm just browsing the web at night. Other than that I'm pretty pleased with mine, hope you enjoy yours too!",
  "guys, that is the link for 3060 legion 5",
  "Awesome!! Is it the 3060 or 3070 variant? How are you finding it?  I am torn between this and the HP Omen 15......",
  "lmao thanks, i have a hitchhikers thumb and it just looks like that. very bendable, dunno why xD",
  "Thank you! It’s real smooth, glad I found it :>",
  "glad to hear it :)",
  "Ryzen 7 5800h, rtx 3050 ti, 16GB DDR4, only 512GB SSD though. It’s a 15.6 inch. 165hz 1920x1080 display.",
  "thank you! it's real nice :>",
  "The display is 1920x1080, 165hz, and honestly real good! Screen can get pretty bright at full brightness, but as laptops work that can effect the battery life (on the go). The 165hz perfectly suits with the rtx 3050 ti, and it's really smooth. Would definitely recommend.",
  "I honestly don't know, went to the BIOS to check, I do know however that you can change from discrete graphics to dynamic graphics if that helps with anything (probably not lmao)",
  "All Legion laptops (2020 onwards) can.",
  "Yep! Two USB-C slots and a camera switch, nothing goes over the camera though it’s just disabled.",
  "In the quiet mode, I’ve heard that it lasts around 4.5 hours without gaming on battery. Depending on the game, your battery will probably last around  2.5h-2h on a charge. Played a bit of Valorant last night after using the laptop to download some stuff on the laptop and got a solid hour and a half. Browsing with Opera GX on battery saver mode definitely saved a lot of the battery. Wouldn’t recommend Google Chrome though, anything you can do on Google chrome can be done on Opera :)",
  "thank you :>",
  "I personally ordered mine from amazon and it took a little less than a week. However, it is newer and more in stock than the pros I’d imagine.",
  "I'm in the same boat,  I asked a representative when they'll hit store shelves and they said they didn't have that info.  Also,  the website said 2+ months,  but the rep said 3+, not sure what to do,  I'm really liking the 16\" display.",
  "Performance is great, the only con for me is the battery life. With watching movies or shows, you can maybe get 4ish hours of watch time and with games I typically see 1-2 hours of gameplay before the battery gets low. Great laptop as long as it can be powered while playing. I really love the RTX, my desktop has an rx 580 and that is nothing in comparison to this. Overall, a great laptop!",
  "Radeon is integrated graphics. The 3050 Ti is dedicated.",
  "There are two graphics cards in it, the radeon is integrated and the rtx is dedicated.",
  "I think it's just plastic, but it doesn't get hot luckily. It is a real beautiful laptop nonetheless.",
  "yeah it just says “Minimalist Chassis” on the page, so probably either plastic or aluminum or something. I actually almost got my hands on the ROG zephyrus G14 but it sold out, and i’m glad it did because now i got this one :)",
  ";) have fun!",
  "That's beautiful bro, look up Neville Goddard and LOA. Use your imagination to change your reality. Trust!",
  "Yeah, my Legion has a little bit of bleed but nothing too noticeable, really only when you’re on a full black screen you see it. Also the fans are real quiet on this one on idle. This is my first gaming laptop so i don’t know much about them so unfortunately i can’t really help with the fans, but i wish you luck. Thank you! :D",
  "It’s a 3050ti actually with a ryzen 7 5800H, you can find the link here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YKG5K7F/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_6SBVTC9P3HNFBCQBSEYR?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1",

  "How is the color gamut and brightness?",
  "The option to turn on/off hybrid mode appears when you open the Legion Vantage software?",
  "I thought the base models cannot do that, that is a new information to me. Thanks!",
  "Is type c charging available?",
  "That's good. I have the ROG zephyrus g14 but I actually like the aesthetics of this laptop more, if it were cheaper and aluminum I would've went with that.",
  "And you have a camera haha",
  "Question though, is it heavy?  How's the battery life when browsing the internet and doing basic things.  My current Acer 17 inch laptop that just died is slightly over 6LB and gets 4-5 hours of battery life.",
  "oh wow can i have a link from where you bought it with that model?",
  "I GET AN I5 WITHOUT GRAPHICS CARD IN 1100$ Sad noises intensifes.",
  "wow that's a great price, in South Africa, laptops with rtx 2060s are around 2000$ usd when the conversion is done",
  "Sheesh not bad for 3050ti",
  "Man you guys are lucky .. in india if they launch such a product that will be more than 1300 USD easily and also very difficult to get hands on... Enjoy 🤠",
  "Wait only 1050 dollar? Not expensive at all",
  "Pretty good deal for those specs.",
  "🤌indeed (oh yeah 165hz lmao)",

  "aw man that sucks 😔",

  "This one will probably do all you need, you just definitely need a good microphone if you’re going to record music, and also this one will run games if you need to.",
  "also, if you don’t want to spend this much there are some cheaper options, if you’re not going to be playing games or streaming or any of that, i’d think looking for a laptop with 8GBs of RAM would be a better option, however if you’re editing videos and playing games as well this is definitely the right option.",

  "Did I Make a Huge Mistake? Lenovo Slim 3 vs ASUS TUF A15 — Need Advice! I just bought a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15AMN8. My goal was to get a professional 14' laptop for work, but one that could also handle games like PES 21, FIFA 23, and maybe  eFootball 2026 and the FIFA 2026 for  online play( I wanna have options) . I’m not a heavy gamer, I mainly played eFootball on mobile, but I got tired of the gameplay and decided to switch to a laptop.\n\nThe Lenovo Slim 3 cost me €528, plus a warranty that brought it to around €700. However, I started second-guessing my choice when I saw the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 priced at €869. I want a laptop that still looks professional for work, but I wouldn’t mind paying the extra €270 for noticeably better performance. The specs of the ASUS A15 are shown in the second photo.\n\nWhat do you all think? Did I make the right choice with the Lenovo, or should I return it and go for the ASUS TUF A15 instead?

  "Should I go with Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 or save for something better? Hi! I'm planning to buy a laptop for university, I'm studying software engineering. I’ve looked into several options, and the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 seems like the best choice in that price range. I’m interested in hearing about other people’s experiences with this laptop: how is the battery life, is it fast enough? The screen has an IPS panel, so I don’t think it's too bad in that regard. I need the laptop mainly for studying and everyday tasks, and it's important to me that it lasts for 4–5 years. Do you think this laptop is good enough, or should I consider some slightly better and more expensive options? Thanks in advance!",
  "I wouldn't buy this laptop as it's 2 major generations old. Look for something newer.\n\nCheck what the specifications of the IPS is. If it's 45% ntsc, then it's trash. The colors can be insanely dull.",
  "This laptop likely won't last that long, it's already a ~4 years old model and it's one of the cheaper ones in terms of build quality. \n\nSave for a more mid-range to high-end laptop with a metal chassis, and one that's modern. Getting 4-5 years out of any laptop is pretty hard without REALLY taking care of it.",

  "i bought the snapdragon version hoping for good battery + speed. instead, what i got - overheating, lag under normal workloads, snapdragon throttling under load, battery dying way faster than promised.",
  "The Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 feels basic and underwhelming. Its plastic build rattles, and the fan noise is annoying even on battery. The screen is okay but nothing special, and the outdated Intel processor struggles with multitasking and gaming. Slow Wi-Fi and limited ports only add to the frustration. For the price, it feels like too many compromises were made, making it a tough recommendation. If you want a budget laptop, there are better options out there that don’t feel this sluggish or cheap. Definitely not a laptop I’d want to rely on daily.",
  "Yes, the screen is 45% NTSC, but I don’t pay too much attention to that because of my limited budget. What matters more to me is that it has good memory and a good processor. The other laptops I’ve looked at in this price range have TN screens, which are much worse.",

  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience). I have a Lenovo duet 5 now which I love but the snapdragon is feeling a little long in the tooth when I have more than a few tabs open.\n\nI guess my heart says Lenovo but brain said MacBook Air.",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop.

My old backing didn't have it (Lenovo Legion 5-15arh05h) So unfortunately this has the wrong pin connector (it's 30, I need 40), but I have my old connector which just has the display connector and the camera connector. The place I bought it from on ebay is allowing me to return it, but I'm not sure I can find a replacement that actually has 40-pin, so I'm wondering....\n\nIf I remove the 30-pin and camera connectors from this and replace them with my old one, would that be ok? Because I'd have to cut off the ribbon that's circled, and I'm not sure what that would affect.",
  "I think thats for the led on the i on the logo on the cover",
  "Probably for the LEDs in the Legion logo. \n\n\nYou might have an entirely different model of a back cover.\n\n\nIf the hinge screw holes align and you can swap the camera module.... I don't see why it won't work.",

  "I've heard nothing but bad things for the Slim models of the Ideapad. I mean like multiple stories of folks getting it and their drive corrupts, bad VRM's or bad RAM with in 10 days of owning it. The RAM is soldered on the board too, so you can't even just change it out. If this meets your needs and your budget, then go for it, but I would consider other options if you have others that you were looking at.",

  "Zen 3+\n\nDon't know how much of a difference it has with Zen 3 tho.",
  "Ram is not soldered what are you talking about",
  "ideapad doesn't stand for anything, it just so happens to be attached to the lowest end consumer grade Windows laptops sold by Lenovo.",
  "It literally says it in the screen shot. 16 GB LPDDR5X 6400MT/s (Soldered) \n\nMeaning you cannot swap it or replace it.",
  "Yea but that’s not the new model so why say all ideapads are bad",
  "Consumer grade laptops are all bad. All of them. They are designed that way though from the top of the industry. They are designed to have some issues within a couple of years, and they won’t sell you parts, so you have to rely on a 3rd party manufacturer and hope it works. \n\nAlso any soldered RAM on a board is bad. This one in specific is bad. If your RAM has issues, most people don’t know how to swap a motherboard in their laptop and are stuck paying $500+ for the manufacturer to fix or just buy a new one. And that cycle continues. \n\nBuy business class ultrabooks if you can. Or Framework.",

  "MacBook Pro vs Lenovo Slim 7 So I’m going to uni for CS and need a new laptop. I’m buying from Australia so options aren’t that great compared to the US but I’ve narrowed it down to the MacBook Pro M4 16/512GB and a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 with Ryzen AI 7 350 16gb RAM and 1tb storage. I’m so confused on what to get and was hoping for some help. \n\nP.s I don’t really upgrade tech that often. I use the same thing for like 5-7+ years",
  "OP, MacBook Pro M4 is better for long-term performance, battery life, & macOS ecosystem, while Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 offers more ports, a brighter OLED screen,&  better multi-core CPU power for a lower price, choose MacBook for longevity & Lenovo for Windows flexibility and display.",
  "For CS you'll be better suited with a Mac due to its \\*nix/BSD foundation.",
  "The main problem with Windows laptops in general is that the build quality isn’t that great compared to Apple and after like 2-3 years of use the battery degradation kicks in full force like I barely get 40mins of light use on my Windows nowadays.The Ryzen might have better multi core performance but Apple’s M4 is just so efficient and powerful for some reason. Istg the only deciding factor here is the price, I could get the Lenovo for much cheaper but am I gonna pay for choosing the cheaper option long term?",
  "Ok so come back I just found a better version of the Lenovo with 32gb of Ram and 1tb storage so now I really don’t know",
  "I’ve heard people say the Unix terminal is better but hardware wise the Lenovo is giving me 32gb ram and 1tb ssd which is double the M4’s (16/512)  and the Lenovo costs less so now I’m really f’ing confused",
  "Okay I'm a CS grad as well, with industry and research experience so let me give you my opinion on this. \n\nThe nix shell or the posix shell is better yes and you'll be better suited with it, but considering budget and pragmatism,  you can also use windows subsystem for linux or wsl. So right now, the main deciding factor for you should be which os you're more comfortable with? Hardware specs are one thing but if you have to sacrifice years of workflow and familiarity it's not worth switching. So if you're on Windows now, stay on Windows. If you've been on macOS, stay on macOS. \n\nAnd obviously cost is a no brainer. If you want more bang for the buck and the Windows machine does your job, why not? \n\nP.S. - 32 GB should make it a breeze to run WSL as the underlying VM takes up about 4GB and you can shut it down when you don't need it. (Automatically shuts down after a while of inactivity)",
  "Thanks for the advice but I think I’ll switch to MacOS because I used my brother’s MB Air a few times and it was the best laptop experience I had and I think I also want to explore other options apart from Windows. I’ll only be using it for 4 years then after graduation I’ll return home where I can build a desktop with better specs!",
  "Great! If macOS works for you,  just get it XD",

  "Lenovo Legion 5i Gen 10 vs HP OMEN 16 Hi everyone, I wanna buy a laptop and found two options. I am an engineering student, doing my masters so I have a lot of modelling and simulation softwares which are quite heavier now. I don't play games much but I know if I will have a good machine, I will utilize it for gaming as well. So from the 2 options I selected as per my budget, I need suggestion. \n\n1: The first option is Lenovo Legion 5i Gen 10 (15\" intel) which is available at official website. Price is 1138 Euros for this machine.\nhttps://www.lenovo.com/at/de/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-5-series/lenovo-legion-5i-gen-10-(15-inch-intel)/83lycto1wwat1?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F&cid=at:sem:119r6x&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=12612285964&gbraid=0AAAAADoYsTVG9sdrCzi93so9m2w4gXDwe&gclid=Cj0KCQiAiqDJBhCXARIsABk2kSlKRsr_RiRusec7INrkd4sG6viELtR1VLEbSAWZcFR1yyep4YEvLpUaAql9EALw_wcB\n\n2: The second option is HP OMEN 16-am0172ng. Price is 1099 Euros but this product is not available on the official website. So I have a little bit doubt in buying this.

  "Happy black week ! Asus Zenbook A14 or Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 ? Hello people and Happy Black Week!\n\nI’m starting medical school in January and I also do programming, so I’m looking for a laptop that’s portable, reliable, and good for both study and coding. I’ve narrowed it down to two models, but they’re so similar in price and features that I can’t decide.

I’m mainly looking for something that will last through med school and handle my programming work smoothly. Also I am very afraid of accidents. I try to not mess up but yk shit happens, so tell me which one in your experience is more accident-proof, more durable,  faster and holds charge better , also which one is deemed more repairable? \n\nIf you have personal experience with these laptops, or can recommend something better in the same price/spec range, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Thank you! ^^",
