  "Guys is this genuine? Like seriously 1 rupees? ",
  "likely a phishing page, open a new tab type \"store.lenovo.com\" manually and make sure it's still in your cart there",
  "Proceed with caution. For that price, I'd say to just go ahead and buy it and see what happens, considering you're on [store.lenovo.com](http://store.lenovo.com), but I'm still very suspicious about it. There's no reason they'd actually sell anything for that price, unless it was a mistake on the website. However, if it is a mistake and it lets you place the order, it's possible that they might still honor the purchase and just eat the loss as a result of their mistake and still send it to you. It looks like the actual Lenovo website. Look closely at the URL, and type in the Lenovo website URL manually and navigate there directly to make sure you're at the right place. If you still see it there, maybe try and see if it lets you order.",
  "Try and find . Pay 1 rupee",
  "If this is real some intern finna be fired",
  "Could be an accident. \n\nI found an issue on HPs website once and got some accessory stuff for Penny's on the dollar.",
  "Already seen that on the Lenovo Page. They released a new device and instead of 2000€ it said 200€ the Order got canceled. Might be mistakes or Intention to get intention",
  "Looks like a scam",
  "Whenever I Google the Indian version of Lenovo's website, it takes me to lenovo.com/in/.\n\nFeels like a scam. If you have a prepaid debit/credit card, it may be worth trying. I wouldn't give any information linked to my bank if I were you.",
  "I have orderd 2 of them at 2 rupees , lets see what happens,  haha",
  "Show us the whole url.\n\nIf that's phishing, all they needed were your payment credentials.",
  "Well Rupees are a fictional currency from The Legend of Zelda video game series so I’d say it isn’t genuine.",
  "Next time just order it and don't post it on places like this",
  "they brought the store down since",

  "Go for it, the worst that can happen is you lose 1 rupee, the best outcome, you effectively get a free laptop, just make sure to use a single use card number (like zip pay single use card, or something similar)",
  "Use a throw away card from Walmart",
  "Check the website, yours might be fake.",
  "Make sure it's the actual site 1st and not just some phishing website to take your credentials and payment information",
  "How?\n\n**Edit:** I found the same bug. Placed an order. Few minutes later some guys from the store called and said they cannot sell it for ₹1 and cancelled the order.",
  "1 rupee and you still asking \"is this genuine\" how old are u boy?",
  "i think OP has done inspect element   \nhe just wanted some attention",

  "Checked. Website is genuine, having Google sign in option as well. The item looks like a wrong entry.. They will correct it and cancel orders before shipping.",
  "I haven't seen any malware that attacks android phones and modify the webpage content / hosts file to redirect you to a phishing page. Looks like a real website, but the pricing is definitely a glitch, which they would either honor it as another redditor mentioned, or cancel the order if you place it. Yet - the company has all rights to cancel an order at anytime and refund you the money. \n\n  \nI'd go for it and see what happens if I were you, no harm in losing a rupee. Virtual cards are best, I remember SBI had this feature at least 10 years ago but not sure now. Proceed with due diligence.",

  "Scam Alert ❗❗❗",
  "Why is that website so sketchy?  Visiting from the US and it still gives me info as if I'm in India?",
  "First you should paste the link so that other users go try it out. \nSecond you buy it and choose the shipping method as STORE PICKUP. \nLastly DON'T GIVE ANY BANK DETAILS EVEN IT'S FREE (they surely want consumers to prepay it).",
  "Not too sure but could of just been a fuck up on their end when pricing. Had it happen a few times on websites, once at JD sports with some AF1 marked down to $20 instead of $200 but they ended up refunding everyone lol and once with a skate deck that was FREE, again they just emailed me saying lol no 😂",

  "I have bad vision but it can’t be this bad to see 1 rupee",
  "It seriously went out of stock lmao",
  "What's the harm in trying bro",
  "Make sure that's really the store site (security certificate and all that).  It might be bait to get you to enter your credit card details.",
  "I guess not..",
  "For me it shows 137k",
  "I think it depends on your country's law system. For example, in Mexico, we have a consumer protection enforcer, which forces the seller to honor their stated price, even in case of human error or similar snafus. This has led to several incredible bargain stories over the years.",
  "Share us the laptop link",
  "I checked it. does show just 1 but currently out of stock. Update us OP",
  "[deleted]",
  "This happened with me too and then they cancelled the order after 2 days",

  "Any updates?",

  "Did you buy it or not?",
  "https://privacy.com\n\nNo reason to not give it a go. Use a burner card from above. First twelve each month are free.",
  "It’s an obvious scam jfc",
  "It's out of stock now 😭",
  "Better order 10 more",
  "Keep us updated OP!",
  "Bro at least sign in \nThen check the price",
  "That website looks suspicious to me.Your card might get blocked or u might get scammed.Lenovo website is secured website while the website you are showing is not secured.I would not make the payment.",

  "So any update?",
  "In Germany it's a different shop. https://www.lenovo.com/de/de/d/sale/\n\nI would be careful",
  "They just want your bank details. Check at the end of website is it really lenovo website or a fake one",
  "i often buy mispriced products on aliexpress, and about 30% of the time i actually get them.",
  "Update us if it gets delivered",
  "They didn’t honour their error in my experience. I purchased a machine on a fantastic sale. The website said that they had it in stock. They in fact did not have it in stock. I only learned this after a month of waiting for it to arrive and it being in the ready to ship stage, still showing that they had stock. When the error was discovered they offered to cancel my order and find a machine that “fit” my needs at whatever price they were selling it at. No, I wanted a machine with the closest specifications at the price that I ordered and paid for the first one that you said you had in stock. They didn’t budge at all. I ordered a machine at $250, the next one that had the closest specifications was $750. The original price of the machine I ordered was $950. Some brands are better than others when it comes to errors. Lenovo isn’t one of them.",
  "i dont remember lenovo's official site looking like this. There was no green color, all the accents were black or red in my memory",
  "I had the same bug on the HP website, €1 for a computer that is worth €1,400, I paid but after a few hours my order was cancelled. They'll probably do the same to you, it must be a bug in the site.",
  "Order it I guess but pay with PayPal or something",
  "Could be a pricing error too. Order it",
  "Which store was it?",
  "Get one for me 😜",
  "If the website is legitimate I'd fuck around and find out 😂",
  "Is store.Lenovo.com strictly for India? I’m in Canada and it’s showing me rupees",
  "What do you fucking think?",
  "Well probably a key logger that want's your card details.",
  "Just create an internet bank account, deposit a small amount of money and purchase it. Simple, end of story.",
  "Yeah, genuinely stealing your personal information.",
  "Could be a price mistake. If you want try it out with a safe payment method",

  "obviously not legit. \n\nThe real website link is lenovo.com\n\nnot site.lenovo.com",
  "Plot twist...\n\nOP made this site so people go and buy/log in and THEY are now stealing your info. This seems way to scummy/scammy. \n\nWeblink isn't true. Copied page.",
  "Be careful could be a wrong Site or sometimes Like Amazon a Price Tag was wrong I could buy it but often the offer was then canceld",
  "Seems like that one incident where the gas prices were mistaken at a station and one comma was off (10 times cheaper price).\n\nAnd some dude was filling like the back of his truck with gasoline. Not sure how specific the action was, but basically they were taking advantage of the situation.",
  "RUN",
  "SCAM!!!!",
  "Purchasing a product at the advertised price isn't illegal. Not selling you a product for the advertised price is illegal in a lot of places. Hopefully in your country too.",
  "Use a burner card if you can. Doesn't hurt to try it.",
  "Is like one of those amazon errors where some products are like 1 dollar",
  "Send me the full link pls",
  "Well this is because the prices are set by the individual store owners. Something like that happened with me too. A laptop I wanted to buy was showing for 50% less at only one lenovo store. It was hella skeptical. I contacted that store and they clarified that is not the correct price and will be changed that morning. ",

  "Link ?",
  "Link ?\n\nIf possible let us know if order",
  "Well, it's been 3 days, have you purchased it already? If so then no problem but if you're still planning to, then I would say they likely have corrected this mistake by now, or even earlier, like 10 hours after you saw it",
  "Might as well give it a shot lol",
  "Link shared by OP seems to be individual local store link and they are free to set their prices so someone probably made a typo.

  "Yeah I'm sure that's much more likely than a simple pricing mistake that happens all the time and would never ship",
  "This is what I'm thinking. Not that they'd do it intentionally, but the order would probably just get entered into their automated system to process it and the request to package and ship the laptop would be passed into their fulfillment/shipping department and someone there might ship it, not knowing or caring what people paid for anything.",
  "Yea, like my dad saw a wrong price on jbls site, 0 euro soundbar, and he ordered one, but then he ordered 15 more. Im pretty sure thats the reason that they catched it. A while ago i saw a wrong price on jbls site, 25 euros for a flip 4 camo. I ordered one and actually recieved it",
  "Most likely true. I work at a very large company and work in picking and shipping orders, and it's generally the same for every company. If a product is in stock and is purchased, the order is automatically added to the queue and dropped in the next wave of orders for the warehouse workers to pick and ship it. \n\nMany times the packlist/order receipt will show the total price of the order, but nobody really pays attention and even if a warehouse grunt sees it, they will assume nothing and still send it out. No managers or financial workers will see the order until well after it is shipped and delivered in most cases",
  "I have worked at a popular grocery store for over a decade. In the U.S. if a store has a price sign in front of a product that indicates an incorrect price, we have to honor it. Otherwise it’s called bait and switch. I have no idea how this is handled online or internationally however.",
  "They don’t. Law undergraduate here. This falls under contract law. A website listing or product is considered as an **invitation to treat**, and not an **offer**. To define an offer, I will quote it from the case of Preston Corpn Sdn Bhd v Edward Leong: An offer is an intimation of willingness by an offeror to enter into a legally binding contract. Its terms either expressly or impliedly must **indicate** that it is to **become binding on the offeror** (buyer) assoon as it has been **accepted by the offeree** (seller).\n\nEven if the customer were to send an offer (by checking out), a **binding contract** is not yet formed because Lenovo has yet to accept that offer and they can choose to back out as there is no **legally enforceable agreement** yet. (A confirmation email is also not signifying of acceptance of order!)\n\nA similar example to this would be Chwee Kin Keong v Digiland Mall Pte Ltd. TLDR is that an employee keyed in a pricing for a product at $66 instead of $3,854 (MSRP) and the company obviously didn’t want to fulfil orders that were made and got taken to court. Court ruled in the company’s favour.\n\nIn consumer court, courts do consistently rule in favour of the seller during obvious pricing mistakes like a $1 phone etc. because they take the view of a **reasonable person in consideration and apply the objectivity test**. \n\nFor example, in this case, the court said:\n“I find ... that the plaintiffs, given each of their backgrounds, would in any event, each have separately realised and appreciated, before placing their purchase orders,that a manifest mistake had occurred – even if no communications on the error had taken place between them. Further, the character of the mistake was such that **any reasonable person** similarly circumstanced as each of the plaintiffs would have had every reason to believe that a manifest error had occurred.” . \n\nOtherwise, the court would also simply treat it as a **clerical or unilateral mistake** and not punish the seller. Similarly in this case, Lenovo would win.\n\nIf there’s any Law graduates reading this and want to improve on my stand, please do! I’m still studying and open to improvement",
  "Nope where it's clearly a mistake and you know it, they don't need to honour it",
  "They are not and three seconds of googling will support that. Just because you once managed to slip one through doesn’t mean that’s the law.\n\nImagine a computer store mislabelling a €4000 laptop at €1 and a large amount of units are ordered overnight while nobody’s at work. Your argument is that EU law now effectively forces this company into bankruptcy by being required to honor these sales that were clearly made exploiting an error in pricing?",
  "No....",
  "Depends on the Ts and Cs",
  "Yeah.... depends on if that's enforceable to a website in another country.... Much like the GDPR fines the EU charges.... a US website isn't subject to that....  even if they decide to keep data on you... because they're not breaking THEIR laws.",

  "Well it's the same in other accounts too",

  "I don't think that's how it works. Especially considering that OP is checking it on a phone. Like imagine if disc.google.com could be swapped by something malicious? \n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but aren't sites check response and then send info about a site, judging from 1) the subdomain, 2) the page (/in) and then parse arguments passed in the url if there are any? It's server-client thing – client sends response (get/post etc.), site's backend transfers specific data to the client (rendering the page if needed and so on). Done.",

  "True, but I was just giving an example to explain. However, if we look at it in layman terms, the universal legal principle will be the same. You simply cannot reasonably expect to enforce a contract based on a price that is **obviously an error**. So in any jurisdiction, I’m highly confident that Lenovo would win should this be taken to court. \n\nIf you search up similar topics, you will find that across common law (Singapore, UK, US) and civil law (France, Germany, EU), the courts follow the same reasoning:\n1.\tObvious pricing errors = no binding contract.\n2.\tBuyers cannot exploit a mistake they recognize.\n3.\tThe worst that happens to the retailer is refunding the money.\n\nHowever, if we are referring to say, a $599 MSRP laptop being listed erroneously at $499, the court may order the seller to honor some of the orders, which has happened in many jurisdictions before, since borderline errors (e.g., 10–25% off normal price) can be interpreted as a discount/promotion and would lead a reasonable person to believe that there is no mistake in pricing.\n\nIn this case though, it’s a laptop for $1. So it’s pretty obvious and no court would side with the buyer.",
  "Incorrect.\nTL;DR Lenovo (and most other companies) explicitly states that a confirmation email does **NOT** signify acceptance of the order. **No acceptance = No contract.** (This clause is commonplace for every business) Consumer will lose if he tries to go to court, even if he has the best lawyer. Below, I will cite Lenovo.\n\n**Full explanation:**\n\nA confirmation email, if you dig deep into any businesses’s Terms and Conditions (the thing that everyone ignores), has built in protective clauses in their Terms of Sale, and they’re not obliged to provide the consumer with any goods or service with a confirmation email alone. **Confirmation email ≠ acceptance.** A confirmation email only signifies that they have **received** the order.\n\nHere, I will specifically cite for this case, Lenovo. Under their T&Cs, it clearly states that **a confirmation of Lenovo receiving and/or processing your order does not constitute acceptance of the order.** (1.2)\n\nSource: https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/legal/new-products-and-warranty-services/?srsltid=AfmBOop9YcXqtlgbWWSEtLd4WCy7paTFtCMABKIs8xZmfYyPvIBRyTbc&ut\n\nIt also states under 1.1 that:\n\n1.1) **No contract** for the purchase of Products or Services will be formed until Lenovo accepts your Order by **one of the following**:\n\n**(a)** shipping the hardware Product and sending you a shipment confirmation email; or\n\n**(b)** making the software Product available to you; or\n\n**(c)** providing the Service to you.\n\nTherefore, that confirmation email is **not a binding acceptance** and is more of an acknowledgment that they’ve received your order and are processing it. Until shipping occurs (or software is delivered, etc.), Lenovo **reserves the right** to cancel or adjust your order **even if** you’ve already received a confirmation email or any other form of confirmation.\n\nI personally think that TV shows these days make the law seem very shallow to the average person, like; “Little guy sues company and wins!”. \n\nThe reality is, that every business has multiple built in protective and failsafe clauses layered into their contracts etc. to make sure that real consumers **will never win against them** in court. I feel like the average person should read more into the T&Cs so they know what they’re getting themselves into, but we don’t, so companies take advantage of that; and that is why we have lawyers :)",
  "Do enlighten me. 99% of companies in the EU are labeled “micro scale”. And also, way to deflect from the question about legislation ;)\n\n“A couple ten thousand dollars” in this case would be 5-10 laptops sold at the wrong price. You can see from this topic that ppl flock to these things like moths to a flame.\n\nMy most commonly used online computer store typically has a stock of about 50 of each gaming laptop, do the math on a say 5 of those products being mislabeled overnight and each those selling out at a €3999 discount. That’s about a million euro lost on a clear database error. “Just suck it up, it’s the law”, yeah not so much bro.",
  "Perfectly legal to have Ts and Cs that reserve the right to cancel orders where there has been made an obvious mistake",

  "Lenovo yoga 7 14inch 2 in 1, amd ryzen ai 7 350, oled 2.8k screen, 32gb and 1tbssd gen 10 I ended up purchasing this laptop in the end, I tried to cancel the order but it was already on a plane flying over to the UK from China which by the way was the quickest delievery ever, sailed through customs within a few hours and was at my door step within 2 days. Highly reccomend Lenovo UK website to order. \n\nAnyway, the laptop is better than I thought, I'm a student so that will be my sole purpose of use, I have a phone to watch ny yt videos and stuff, I just need Microsoft 365 and Google for research. \n\nWarning: it really isn't a gaming laptop from what I can tell, however you can still play but I don't think you will get the most out of the games. \n\nPossitives:\nThe screen is beautiful 😍  I paid extra for the 2.8k oled and it was worth it, crisp, sharp, colourful and overall vibrant. \n\nIt's a touch screen, using my fingers is smooth, you can adjust the settings for touch sensitivity which I did, it's responsive, smooth and quick. I'm not sure about the pen I'll mention that in the negatives. \n\nThe sound is beautiful, it's louder, and alot clear compared to my previous laptop. No issues with sound and comes from both sides of laptop which is good. \n\nMakes zero noise, since I got it and I've put the updates on, which was super quick by the way, but it's silent. Probably no sound or if there is a sound I cannot hear it. I can hear a fan it's pretty peaceful. \n\nCharges super quick.\n\nPen charges super quick and battery lasts a few days depending on use. \n\nI've used the laptop all day working and researching and it's smooth, handles the workload well, and hasn't heat up like my older laptop which heat up and made a bit of noise when the workload got heavy. \n\nThe battery has last me from 5pm Thursday to 10pm Friday night. I'm happy with this, I was constantly updating, and doing my studies so it definitely holds up good. \n\nYou can remove the ai features which I did. \n\nSimple setup \n\nLooks beautiful especially in Tidal Teal\n\n14inch is big enough for carrying around. The 16 inch is similar in price but I personally found it too big and heavy the 14 inch is the right weight and perfect screen size. And honestly the 16 inch in general is far too big to carry around unless you plan to keep it in one place. \n\nNegatives: \nThe hinges don't seem strong. I hate to say this. It's a shame but I will probably not be using tablet mode, although when placed in tablet and tent mode it's still smooth and works great. But the hinges are a bit concerning. When in laptop mode the screen wobbles a bit too much. So yeah those hinges are a concern... \n\nRyzen ai 7 350 is meh. It's still fast and smooth but it's definitely not as amazing as I thought. I would reccomend the intel version over the amd ai. But it's still a good laptop for school work \n\nThe pen is not as sensitive as the finger, they send the new release yoga pen with the laptop and it isn't the best. Better off getting another type of pen.\n\nThe slot for the memory card looks concerning, I have not tried it yet but I'm not sure if I will..doesn't look like it will ever come back out. \n\nYou'll forever be cleaning the laptop no matter how much you wash your hands and they are clean this laptop is a magnetic for finger prints, the keyboard too. The touchscreen isn't that bad I've not had to clean it much. \n\nOverall I reccomend this laptop to students \n\n",

There were some AMD/Realtek sound issues that couldn't be fixed at the time (maybe because the CPU was brand new, or for some other reasons). The sound from the laptop's speakers was laggy. I tried all the suggestions from Reddit and other relevant websites and decided to return the laptop after a few days.",

And I would have got it in silver the Tidal Teal shows the finger prints too blatantly no matter how much you wash your hands and clean the laptop. \n\nIf you're using the laptop for heavy professional stuff like editing gaming definitely upgrade... for light work like browsing and Microsoft 365 etc get the 350",

  "Honestly, with the price point you can get a better spec, this laptop has its issues or \"teething problems\" yes it looks pretty, vibrant and colourful but it can lack in the performance, for example it freezes a lot when in tablet mode, the side buttons turn the laptop off when accidently pressed, the pen is not that great, the pen also leaves a lot of marks on the laptop screen which is hard to get off, almost like faint scratches, but the pen in general does not respond well to laptop and is not smooth, the laptop mouse or trackpad freezes, although the recent update did fix this, but ill be honest the tent mode and tablet mode freezes a lot, not sure why. \n\nThe hinges look weak! However not broken so far so cant be as bad as they look \n\nThe laptop for the price is not worth it and I recall somebody on here telling me to get a better spec but I didnt listen and I wish I did. \n\nThe web cam is terrible too almost like sometjing from the year 2000\n\nBattery life is terrible even in the power saver mode its awful lasts me around 4 hours maybe 5 when in heavy use my Dell lasted me 8 hours straight. This laptop needs charging often \n\n\nThe positives are I managed to turn AI features off besides a few which is great! \n\nThe 14inch is a godsend its perfect!!! If you plan to use it as a tablet or tent mode do not get anything bigger it will just feel and look awful and chunky \n\nThe laptop is slim in design looks sleek. \n\nBattery charges super quick like very quick the first charge I did up to 100 and then after that I set it to 80 to protect the battery life spam and it makes no difference either way it needs charging after 4 or 5 hours or heavy use. \n\nIts bright, the display is gorgeous 😍 \n\nIf I could return it and choose another I would opt for a thinkpad and opt for specs, performance over looks and the tablet mode gimmick \n\nHave a look after to see if there are better specs for the similar price range and ask ppl on reddit who know about laptops they gave me good advice which I didnt lsiten to much",

  "I would get it in intel if you're thinking about it and also if you really want amd go for ryzen 9 ai 370 if you can get it",

  "It even feels slow for it's specs",
  "Thanks, but I have somewhat bad prior experience with Intel (typing this now on a Yoga 7 with Intel 1260p) and their integrated graphics, especially on Linux. AMD on the other hand works like a dream, and Linux support for AMDGPU is the best of the bunch by far. That's why your laptop is exactly what I was looking for. And yes, getting a HX370 is next to impossible now. I guess AMD has really low yields with 300 series and all 370s and above end up in high-end devices with dedicated graphics (like ProArt and Zephyrus) - which doesn't make sense as 890M is already a really powerful GPU. But given no desktop-replacement GPUs from AMD right now (no 9000 mobile series yet) it seems the high-end gaming will be stealing our AMD CPU supply for some time to come.",
  "Yes ofc. You said you felt it wasn't worth the price. So I was wondering how much you spent on it",
  "Yep unfortunately I went for a 2 in 1 and lenovo focused on looks over anything else",
  "That's really interesting,  im a big fan of amd and and dont think I've ever used an intel except for at work maybe, but this is the only laptop I found intel runs so smoothly and is probs a bit better and for the life of me I cant figure out why. \n\nIt does do the job though, I only use it for research and Microsoft 360 light browsing so it fits me needs don't think its good enough as a gaming laptop",

  "Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Gen 6: First impressions I purchased the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G6, model 21NQCTO1WWBR1 on July 2025 and would like to make my impressions about this product:\n\nDESIGN AND BUILD: We don't have much to comment on the design, as it's quite minimalist. We're surprised that not all the keyboard keys follow Lenovo's signature layout, as is typical on IdeaPads, but at least the Ctrl and Fn keys are in their traditional positions, unlike ThinkPads. The light color isn't bad, but it's a shame there wasn't a darker color option (not black, which is typically only seen on ThinkPads, but a darker gray would have been nice). The touchpad is a good size. We found the number of ports interesting, but the Ethernet port's position wasn't particularly helpful, being on the right side. It's interesting that it also has an SD card reader. The number of LEDs also caught our attention, with one next to each USB-C port, in addition to the power button itself (which we really like being separate from the keyboard). We liked the backlit keyboard and the dedicated \"?\", \"/\", \"°\", and \"Menu\" keys, although they sacrificed one of the Ctrl keys. At least it didn't come with the \"Copilot\" shortcut. We didn't really like the notch in the webcam area and found it a rather questionable design decision, but we understand its usefulness. We also liked that it came without those infamous labels on the palm rest, just the Intel seal.\n\nSCREEN: We liked the quality of the IPS, but we were disappointed that the screen had excessive IPS Glow at the bottom edge, quite visible with the screen on a black background even in bright light. My brother was okay with it, but I didn't like this defect at all, which I'm already accepting is quite common in current LCD screens, as I've also seen notebooks and even smartphones and tablets from other brands with this issue. It shouldn't happen, but we've come to understand that IPS Glow is now part of the experience of having an IPS LCD screen, which is unfortunate. At least we like the thin bezels.\n\nSOUND AND WEBCAM: Neither impressed in any aspect, but neither disappointed.\n\nBATTERY AND CHARGING: The USB-C charger is interesting. My brother tested it by playing YouTube videos in 1080p with maximum brightness, and it lasted over 5 hours unplugged. For a 60Wh battery, it's an okay battery, but it could be better.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND USABILITY: Regarding performance, considering its specifications, I consider it okay. It worked very well even for running virtual machines via VirtualBox. We didn't notice excessive heat on the keyboard when heavily loaded. My brother installed the Big Linux distro, and in testing, it has worked well, including mirroring the laptop screen to our Smart TV wirelessly. My brother was unable to get BlissOS, based on Android 13, to work, as it didn't recognize Wi-Fi, but emulating Android on Big Linux with WayDroid has worked well most of the time.\n\n**Have you also purchased a Lenovo ThinkBook?

  "I got the same laptop, with 8gb of RAM, and im quite satisfied with it. I use it mainly for college stuff, and it can handle an entire day of coding, browsing the internet and even playing some light games (such as Horizon Chase). \n\nBattery life on it is quite impressive on linux. I get 6-8h of usage with it. That's more than i get with Windows (i have no idea why i just get 3-5 hours on Windows), but i've seen some minor compatibility issues on linux, such as the mute key not lighting up or the volume keys getting \"sticky\" (if i hold it a little bit, it goes to max volume or 0), but overall, the laptop is very usable.\n\nI plan to upgrade to 16gb soon, because on my use case, 8gb is too low, especially when i get 16 tabs open for research + some niche software from 10 years and VScode.\n\nOBS: Você é o CAVBR do fórum Adrenaline, não é?",

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work.

  "Is the Lenovo ThinkPad E16 gen 2 with HS processors undervolted? If not do they overheat? Hi Reddit, This is Kavin. My laptop had stopped working recently. So I was wondering if I could get a reliable laptop that could last me for the maximum amount of time. Of course, my first preference was to get a ThinkPad. I've done my research across all the other brands and ended up looking at a ThinkPad, which is pretty good in terms of specs. One thing that ached me was that this exact model has a HS processor, which might be undervolted by Lenovo; if not, it might overheat. I've attached a photo of this laptop and its naked back to give an idea of how it looks and show how big the fan and the heat sink are. This is the link to the laptop: [https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nx00](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nx00)\n\nThese are all the variants of the laptop: [https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/len101t0098?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252F&irclickid=xta2FnyEixycWL9XgKWeZxMQUkp20iUiCTv0W00&irgwc=1&Program=9634&pid=5215192&acid=ww%3Aaffiliate%3Alx67i4&cid=in%3Aaffiliate%3Afiv7n7](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/len101t0098?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252F&irclickid=xta2FnyEixycWL9XgKWeZxMQUkp20iUiCTv0W00&irgwc=1&Program=9634&pid=5215192&acid=ww%3Aaffiliate%3Alx67i4&cid=in%3Aaffiliate%3Afiv7n7)\n\n Found a good review: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNkDvzWrEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNkDvzWrEY)\n\n# Uses:\n\nLet me tell you what I'm gonna use this laptop for. I will use it for light gaming, school work (Projects), occasional edits and browsing. I'm not gonna game crazy hard, of course. But I will be playing games like Apex Legends, Counter-Strike 2, etc.\n\n# Expectations:\n\nI'm a 16-year-old guy. I expect this laptop to last me for a period of 5-7 years. I don't want anything like hardware requirements to stop me from doing my work, which is mostly school work, some light games, and university projects. I wanna make the most out of this laptop, so pls put your recommendations on how to use it efficiently or the first things to do on this laptop (pls don't tell me not to play games). In conclusion, I want a smooth time with this laptop.\n\n# Questions:\n\n1. Is this undervolted by Lenovo?\n2. Will it overheat? (Are the thermals good enough to support this processor?)\n3. Should I go for this one instead (Which has Ryzen 5 U processor): [https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nr00](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nr00)\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nI would like to know what you ppl think.

I also live outside of the local city, my WIFI is bootycon meaning ABSOLUTE TRASHHHHHH so I am just hoping it's because of that.

IDK but its a small laptop with google chrome), I needed the upgrade bc my exams are required to be proctored online and google chrome blocks the Guardian browser, which is what they use to proctor), Overall I'm hoping I don't regret this buy.

  "Yeah I realized I said RAM directly after posting it. And which 1TB stick did you get?",
  "1 Terabit?",
  "I'm thinking the exact same thing.",
  "I replied to the other comments, I was thinking of the RAM that I was getting lol",
  "Is there a difference in brands when buying RAM? I was thinking of buying a 16GB RAM stick, but I wasn't sure which one to get. \n\nAlso do you have any recommendations for Gen 3 PCIE SSD sticks?",
  "What are you planning to use it for? A secondary storage? They're fine.\n\nBut for boot drive? The P3 isn't recommended, because it's DRAM less. I'd lean more towards T500.\n\nBut you should look at your laptop's supported PCIE gen, if it's only gen3 then you'll be limited to gen3 speeds even when you use gen4 sticks (don't worry, they're backwards compatible).",
  "I got p3 pro.",
  "Yes,as my secondary ssd.",
  "Also just a heads up. \n\nI used all of these parts in Lenovo devices. \n\nIncluding the Thinkbook line.",
  "I apologize. I sent you the wrong ram listing. \n\nHere is what you need. Your laptop only has 1 slot from what I found online. \nTEAMGROUP Elite DDR4 32GB Single 3200MHz PC4-25600 CL22 Unbuffered Non-ECC 1.2V SODIMM 260-Pin TED432G3200C22-S01 https://a.co/d/6Zs0rbC\n\nFor the m.2, I recommend this one. \n\nIt's cheap but good. \nhttps://a.co/d/aIAogtT\n\nIt is a bit more expensive, it is worth it.\n https://a.co/d/7qMpvaD",
  "There is a difference in ram, depending on the speed and the type. \n\nIf you just want 16gb, you can go with this. \n\nhttps://a.co/d/i2smNyx",
  "The more you learn. I am updating an HP EliteBook 840 G10 to a 1TB in the only NMVe slot i have, but I am using the exact P/N from HP's service guide for the 1TB option.\n\nThis is still a good tip and I will get the specs of the actual  drive to verify.\n\nI suspect HP would know about this and qualify only SSDs that have DRAM since it is also the boot device.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a confusing sentence.",
  "I use it for my college classes, and I plan to use it for some gaming on the side too. I see that it supports Gen 3 SSD only, so I don't think I can use the T500. Do you have any other recommendations for Gen 3 SSD sticks?",
  "But 1 Terabit is equal to 125 Megabytes though.\nYou sure it's 1 Tb and not 1 TB?",
  "Got it, thanks.",
  "ADATA XPG SX8200, Samsung 970 Evo Plus.\n\nYou can use the T500 or any other gen4 and gen5 sticks just fine, it's just that their speed will be limited to gen3 speeds. So it's more of a \"you don't get the performance you're paying for\".",
  "You cooked nothing",
  "Makes perfect sense to me!",
  "Perfect, thanks!",
  "You can always refer to Tom's Hardware reviews to check whether the SSD you're looking for (outside from the two I've mentioned) does have a DRAM or not. They have you covered for that specific info. 👍\n\nMake sure the TBW rating is reasonable too, don't pick those that have low TBW rating (like for example 4 TB size, 900 TBW. Or 2 TB size, 480 TBW. 1 TB size, 320 TBW. Those are quite low). \n\nNVMEs with lower TBW rating for their capacity tend to be more apparent on DRAM less SSDs though, and sketchy brands often not mentioning anything about the TBW rating aside from their sequential speed.",
  "I appreciate the information, will do.",
  "Ah one more thing I forgot to mention, because it's an issue on my laptop because I didn't make sure of it first.\n\nMake sure whether your laptop's M.2 socket can fit a double-sided SSD or can only fit a single-sided stick. As far as I know, for 2TB size, only Samsung that have single-sided sticks (they use 1TB NAND chips each to make it possible). There's still plenty of single-sided choices though for 1TB size. Make sure you ask the seller or look for reviews for that specific size. \n\nOn my current laptop (HP Omen16 2021), I have 2 slots, but only one slot that can fit double-sided NVMe. The other one can only fit single-sided sticks since the bottom of the socket has a piece of metal that connects directly to the cooling system to actively help cooling the NVME. On the other hand, my older laptop (MSI P65 Prestige), have two sockets as well but both sockets support double-sided sticks.",
  "I'll check. Is double-sided the same as dual channels?",

  "Dell Inspiron 14 5440 or Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Gen 6? Assuming they have the same amount of RAM and SSD. Which one is more reliable?",
  "Between these two, the Lenovo ThinkBook is a lot more reliable and durable. The Inspiron 5000 series is a mid-level consumer series laptop built for medium-term entertainment. The new ThinkBook generation is a mid-level business series laptop built for long-term performance.",

  "CES 2025 Lenovo Laptops. Thoughts? Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition vs X1 Carbon Gen 13 vs X9 Aura Edition CES 2025 Laptops just got released for preorder. I think these 3 options looks and feel great but I do not know which one to choose. Would love to hear any opinions from anybody.\n\nI am mainly using the laptop for simple tasks such as checking emails, editing documents, using Office, general web browsing and media consumption. I travel a lot so the X1 Carbon's weight is a plus but not sure whether the battery life is good and I am lowkey worried about having fingerprint stains all the time on my laptop as I had a bad experience with the XPS 13 2in1. \n\nThe X9 and Yoga 9i 2-in-1 looks like they will not be attracting so much stains but I wonder if the extra weight will be noticeable.\n\nWould love to hear u guys chime on this! I would be most likely pulling the trigger by the start of February!",
  "More consumer slop that has minimal improvements over last year's models.",
  "My wife is getting a new Yoga 9i Aura Edition, I'm curious to see how it works out...  Looking at the new 2-in-1's hitting the market, it seems to be the best option.  It got the top nods from people at CES.  Followed closely by the updated ASUS.  She's an educator and the school district is supplying it.  She got to order whatever laptop she wanted through their IT portal, which basically lets her pick anything from Apple, Lenovo or Dell.  She's been predominantly Apple based for several years, lives on her iPad Pro, but changed schools this past fall.  Apple does not play nice in her new environment that is a mis-mash of Windows and Chrome, so she asked for the new computer.  Went 2-in-1 so she could keep with her notes and annotations workflow and PDF authoring as she's been doing.  \n\nAnyway, should have it by the end of the month, config:  Ultra 7 258V w/ 32GB RAM, Windows 11 Pro, 512GB SSD, 2.8K 120Hz OLED.\n\nFrom my perspective...  I agree with the other poster here that it looks like more consumer slop.  The Ultra 7 2xx CPUs (Lunar Lake) seem to be an improvement over the 1xx series, but still lagging behind others.  Lenovo seems to at least be using a decent screen and apparently the speakers are not complete trash.  Still chunkier than it needs to be, mostly to keep using those Intel CPUs and chipsets.  Battery life on the current 9i looks to be underwhelming and I don't expect an improvement on this slightly upgraded version with the 200 series CPU.   2-in-1 laptops are always a handful of compromises, but I think my wife's use case is what they're made for.",
  "Yea I think the 9i 2-in-1 would work well for your wife since she does annotating a lot. I like the current 9i due to its curved edges and design and i think the Lunar Lake chips would improve the battery life enough to give a decent full day usage or if not close to it.\n\nRight now how I would look at the 3 options I have would be:  \nYoga 9i 2-in-1: Bigger Battery and 2-in-1 is nice for its versatility   \nThinkpad X9 14: A Windows Mac that does not attract fingerprint stains like the X1   \nX1 Carbon G13: Really light and great for travel but fingerprint/stain magnet\n\nI was leaning to the X1 Carbon G13 before CES 2025 released the new models and X9 seems like a good in-between option due to its metal design. I do know its getting a lot of hate for it not having the trackpoint but I don't see myself needing it anyway as I never owned a Thinkpad before.\n\nIf the X1C isn't so prone to stains and all like what people claim it to be, I would definitely get the X1 Carbon for its weight. Otherwise, the X9 is a good workaround for me and 9i would just be for its bigger battery.",
  "Hi can you tell as how is the battery life?",
  "lunar lake literally is best in class. not else touches it on windows.",
  "Battery life seems reasonable for an intel chip.  My wife is getting a full day out of it pretty easy but she’s not pushing it too hard.  Mostly email, Office apps, Google Docs and such.  Notes / annotations.  The pen is OK, not as good as the Apple Pencil or the Wacom based ones on the Surface.  I couldn’t tell you more specifically than that.",
  "ASUS Vivobook S 15 vs  Lenovo ThinkPad E16 Gen 2 Hi! Please help me choose between these laptops. Vivobook S15 has AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. Thinkpad has Intel Core Ultra 7 155H.
