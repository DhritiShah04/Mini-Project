  "Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024) vs Lenovo ThinkPad P1 I've narrowed my search down to 2 laptops and can't decide which to go with. Which would you recommend?\n\n**Use:** I would mainly use the laptop for data science coursework and occasional gaming (MS Flight Simulator, FIFA, GTA). I want the laptop to last at least 5-6 years.\n\n**Price:** Price is not a factor since I'm not paying for it.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n|-|Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024)|Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 6|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|CPU|Ultra 9 185H|i9-13900H|\n|GPU|RTX 4090|RTX 4090|\n|TGP|115W|105W|\n|RAM|32 GB|32 GB|\n|SSD|2 TB|1 TB|\n|Display|2560x1600 240Hz OLED|2560x1600 165 Hz IPS|\n|Battery|90 Whr|90 Whr|\n|Power|240 W|230 W|\n|Dimensions (cm)|35.4 x 24.6 x 1.74|35.95 x 25.38 x 1.75|\n\nBoth have vapor chamber cooling. I like that the ThinkPad doesn't look like a gaming laptop and has lots of reviews, whereas the Asus is brand new. ThinkPads are also known for their reliability.\n\nI like that the Asus is slightly smaller, has a higher TGP, an OLED display, slightly better CPU, and a higher refresh rate.",
  "Despite similar specs, the two target very different audiences.  If your priority is gaming, the G16 should get you better graphics performance and will have the better screen (although both will have excellent screens), better speakers, and also include a lot of tuning software allowing you to adjust power limits, fan curves, keyboard lighting, etc.  You will also benefit from a large online gaming community with loads of tips on how to optimize your computer/gaming settings.  If you use the laptop professionally and care about a clean/muted look, best-in-class keyboard, Thinkpad support, then go with the Thinkpad.  I, for one, love the Thinkpad Trackpoint (red nub) so will always go with the P1 if the specs are the same.  But it is getting tougher and tougher to choose as Asus has really done a good job making the ROG Zephyrus line pretty clean and sleek.",
  "+1 for Zephyrus, but consider where you’re buying it from. \n\nI love ASUS laptops/products but their support can sometimes be lacking. If you’re in the US, get it from a reliable 3rd party reseller like Bestbuy, MicroCenter, etc.",
  "Thinkpad or Zephyrus My current laptop (Surface Book 2 13.5) is still doing quite well but I'm looking to upgrade, mostly because of performance restraints and reliance on cloud for ML tasks. I work with applied AI but all the tooling I need from work is provided, but I want to have more power for my tinkering outside of work.\n\nI have narrowed it down to 2 options: The Lenovo Thinkpad P1 Gen 7 or the Asus Zephyrus G16\n\n\n\nThe Thinkpad is on sale for £1800 with the following specs:\n\nIntel® Core™ Ultra 7 165H vPro® Processor\n\n4060 8Gb 60W\n\n32Gb (upgradable, but expensive to do so)\n\n1Tb\n\n16\" 3840x2400 IPS 60Hz\n\n\n\nAnd the Zephyrus G16 is more modern and also not on sale (\\~£2650) with the following specs:\n\nIntel® Core™ Ultra 9 Processor 285H\n\n5070ti 12Gb 120(?)W\n\n32Gb (soldered)\n\n1Tb\n\n16\" 2560 x 1600 OLED 240Hz\n\n\n\nMy usage consists of the following:\n\nMy laptop goes about 13 hours between long charges, with 4-6 of those being light usage (coding/web browsing/reading and highlighting academic papers) and the rest is just idle with screen off and shut. I can charge it with a very low wattage USB-C connection when out. When I'm at home and I have the main charger I will often be hooked up via USB-C to an external monitor, I'll do more coding and web browsing but I'll also be running ML models (mostly Graph Neural Networks and Multi Agent RL - not LLMs). I also don't train locally, but having the ability to prototype small models before I send it up to the cloud and leave it to train would be useful. I do also want to perform data processing with pandas locally. Aside from that whilst I do game it's only League of Legends/Minecraft so I don't need to worry about running AAA games. I'm looking to use this laptop for the next 5+ years so having longevity in mind is important, although if the Thinkpad becomes outclassed because it is cheaper I'd be okay with upgrading earlier.\n\nI haven't been able to see either of them in person to get a feel for them, and I can't decide off of specs and reviews alone, so hoping I can get some help deciding. \n\nOne final and somewhat important point is I am British, I prefer the English UK ISO layout - which means a big enter key, if that is or isn't possible on the laptop that does have some sway in my decision.\n\nI am also somewhat open to suggestions. I have also considered:\n\n\\- MacBook Pro - but I need windows/WSL and x86 (as well as NVIDIA for local CUDA)\n\n\\- Framework 16 - I don't think the 16 system is mature enough yet, especially for the cost",
  "Consider the Thinkpad T1G? It's the version of this year's P1 (Gen 8) with gaming (RTX 5060/5070) graphics cards. Best of both worlds? Unsure how pricing is over the pond.",
  "Laptop with good performance under $1500? Hello! I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this, but if anyone has suggestions for a laptop, that would be much appreciated!\n\nI am looking for a laptop that I plan on using for normal Microsoft office/researching 60%, Gaming 20%, Movies 10%, and Photoshop/3D modeling 10% of the time.\n\nI would prefer if it could handle some decent gaming as I may use it a bit more for that in the future. Games such as Minecraft or the Sims (even COD games if possible) but it isn't a main concern. \n\nSome main features that I'm looking for are a good screen (touchscreen if possible), decent battery life (5+ hours), and backlit keyboard would be a plus.\n\nI was hoping to stay under $1000 if the laptop isn't super good at gaming, but if one is good at gaming I'm willing to look in the $1500-1800 range as well. \n\nI've looked at the Microsoft surface 7 but have heard some mixed reviews, and I've also checked out the Asus Zen book 14 which seems to have mixed reviews as well. The Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 7 seems like it may be good, so I was wondering what peoples experience are with it. \n\nI'm sorry for the long post, but any suggestions would be super helpful, thank you!",

Need high CPU perf and lots of RAM, and I choose hot&silent over cool&loud, battery life is not super high priority.\n* Display 14-16'' 16:10 IPS matte\n* Weight under 2kg (4.4lbs) as I need to travel with it almost daily, thinness does not matter that much\n* 32GB RAM (ideally extensible to 64GB), keyboard without numpad, \"office look\", Intel based system preferred because of thunderbolt 4\n\nSo far, I found these two laptops and specs that match most of my criteria:\n\n* **15'' Dell XPS 9520 (precision 5570 is basically the same but with higher prices)**\n   * i7-12700H/FHD+/32GB/1TB SSD/RTX3050Ti for 2780 EUR (weight \\~1.92kg)\n   * 4K or 3.5K OLED screen with same spec for 3020 EUR, but those are glossy screens and I am super afraid of annoying reflections as I always had matte displays and was super happy with them\n* **16'' HP ZBook Studio G9 (slightly lighter but bigger dimensions than dell xps 15)**\n   * i7-12700H/FHD+/32GB/1TB SSD/RTX3050Ti for 2470 EUR (weight \\~1.75kg)\n   * i7-12700H/FHD+/32GB/1TB SSD/RTX3060 (vapor chamber cooling) for 2600 EUR\n   * i7-12700H/UHD+(matte)/32GB/1TB SSD/RTXA2000 for 3000 EUR - this one has gorgeous matte display\n* 16'' Lenovo X1 Extreme Gen 5 (or P1 G5) also matches my criteria but unfortunately not available in my country with reasonable specs and prices..\n\nI like the design of both, no clear winner for me. HP ZBook Studio G9 seems like the better deal, but there are not enough reviews so far. The only detailed one is on [notebookcheck.net](https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-ZBook-Studio-16-G9-laptop-review-Workstation-with-120-Hz-DreamColor-display.667804.0.html), and ZBook delivered excellent benchmark scores, but review also mentions high fan noise in light/avg load which would be no-go for me.  **I am wondering if the spec with RTX 3060 that has vapor chamber cooling translates to lower fans RPM and thus lower noise? Any experience or thoughts?** For Dell XPS 15 there are also reports of high fan noise in lighter load, but it seems to me that most people report that it is one of the most silent laptops in this category. Btw. I understand 12700H in these medium sized chassis would be thermal throttled, but I assume perf will still be better than P-series processors in business-oriented laptops (thinkpads, carbons, lattitudes etc). Would appreciate your thoughts or suggestion of alternatives. Thanks for your help!",

Most of the money goes into the dedicated GPU, which he needs the least. Not to mention less airflow, more heat, and another thing that can cause problems.\n\nIf that money goes into a better build quality, and RAM.

The integrated microphone is *extremely* good for a laptop, hands down best laptop mic I've heard. I'm running Linux on it, it's very well supported and everything works as expected except the mic which needs a kernel edit to work (I've sent a patch a month or so ago, but i think it got forgotten :/ )\n\nIn the bios you can dedicate from 256mb to 4gb to the igpu.

  "Old ones okay maybe if decently priced. Problem are new ones, being super overpriced while offering very little. An example : A mid range T14 G5 with a core ultra 5 125U, 60hz 1200p sRGB IPS display, 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage, which for those two are getting below today's standard, is priced at 1200€. Those are specs you'd find on a 600-700€ laptop, not a 1200€ laptop. At 1000€ you can already get something well built with a Ryzen 7 8th gen, 32gb of ram and 1tb of storage (Asus Zenbook, HP Elitebook, etc). In this case that laptop OP showed was a pretty fine deal, but if you took a Thinkpad for the same price you'd have an E14 Gen 6 with even worse specs.

  "Looking at the Lenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 10 AMD (16″) for mechanical engineering + power and gaming use. Is it any good or is there any better? Hey all, I’m in my mechanical engineering program (so lots of CAD, simulation, maybe some rendering, plus general heavy multitasking) and I also have a Mac for lighter stuff, but I’m looking to get a *really* powerful Windows laptop that is also reliable and high quality. My budget is about **$2,000 CAD** (or close), and I’m considering [The Legion Pro 5 Gen 10 AMD (16\")](https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83LTCTO1WWCA2). Specs/options;\n\n* Processor: AMD Ryzen 9 8945HX (16C/32T) in this model. \n* Screen: 16″, WQXGA (2560×1600) presumably, good resolution for engineering/design work. RAM: I’ve upgraded it from 16 GB → 32 GB for $90 (seems like a very worthwhile upgrade for my use-case).\n* GPU: I have two options: stick with the RTX 5060 (the base GPU in some configs) or pay **$200** more to upgrade to the RTX 5070. Specs at a glance: RTX 5060 and RTX 5070 both 8 GB GDDR7 in this model. \n* Other specs: The model supports solid ports (USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, RJ-45) and build looks quite decent.\n\n**My questions to you all:**\n\n1. For my use (mechanical engineering, CAD/simulation, maybe rendering, multitasking, gaming), is the RTX 5070 *worth* the additional $200 compared to the 5060? Will I see meaningful benefits (in CAD/engineering workloads and gaming) or is the 5060 “good enough” and worth saving the $200?\n2. From the perspective of reliability, build quality, brand reputation: how does the Legion Pro 5 line look? Are there known issues (thermals, noise, durability) I should be aware of? I want something I can rely on through my degree and beyond.\n3. Given my budget (\\~$2,000) and the upgrade I’m doing to 32 GB RAM, does the config seem balanced (CPU strong, GPU choice open, RAM done) or am I perhaps over-investing in something that won’t pay off long-term?\n4. Any red flags (in this model or manufacturer) I should check (e.g., warranty, serviceability, cooling, noise level under load, portability/weight given 16″ size)?\n5. Is there any other laptop that is better and more powerful for this price range?\n\n**What I’m leaning toward:**  \nI really want headroom so I don’t feel like I’ve “cheap-ed out” on the GPU, especially since engineering software and maybe some creative work might benefit from a stronger GPU. On the other hand, if the 5060 already handles everything well and the difference to 5070 is marginal (or mostly gaming-oriented), then maybe I stick with 5060 and save $200 (and invest elsewhere maybe SSD, battery, etc).\n\nWould love to hear from folks who have used this exact model (or similar Legion 5/Legion Pro rigs), especially engineers or users doing heavy workloads (not just gaming). I would also love to hear if anyone has any better options that heyve personally owned. Thanks in advance!\n\n  \n",
  "The majority of the computational workloads you will do as a Mechanical Engineer will be mostly handled by your CPU rather than your GPU, the GPU will mostly just be used for making the visual model that you will be manipulating (so not nearly as significant). The mobile 5070 this generation isn't that much more performant than the 5060 either and is still restricted to 8gb of vram. I wouldn't say going for the 5070 would be worth it.\n\nNow, although the 8945HX is a Zen4 CPU rather than the most recent Zen5 architecture it is still very formidable and can easily last you for years in regards to CAD and FEA. As for gaming that is kind of up to you.\n\nYou could technically get better performance in CAD with a competing Intel CPU as those tasks do heavily rely on single threaded performance but the AMD cpus these days will do way more than fine for that.\n\nNow, 32gb of ram is great for smaller to medium sized builds but if you would like to carry this into the future you should go and get a 64gb kit. That's a problem for the future though, 32 is fine for now.",

I do a fair amount of engineering projects (3D modelling, simulations) and video editing.\n\nI've been waiting over half a year now for the new ThinkPad P1 gen 8 and its RTX 50 version (T1g), but recently Asus unveiled an RX 50 version of their ProArt 16, which now comes with a 120Hz tandem OLED 1000 nits display. It seems to have a much higher TDP of 120W, compared to the T1g of 60-75W. I seem to be leaning towards the Asus for now. \n\nAny other suggestions, things I should know about or comments about either laptops / predecessors based on what you've used in the past? like customer service\n\nThanks",

Kind of a creaky and flexy chassis but something’s gotta be sacrificed. \n\nThe P1 / T1G gen 8 will only ship next MARCH with the higher res displays. That’s utterly unacceptable for how late it is.

  "Surface Pro 7 vs Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga X1 (3rd Gen) I'm planning to go on a backpacking trip quite soon and I was looking on eBay for cheap laptops to take along. \n\nThe issue is that I'm also a freelance designer and I want to work on my portfolio on the go. For Adobe, Rhino (no ARM), Affinity I figure I need atleast 16RAM, 32 is hard to find for cheap, and I don't want to take a 1.500€+ device around the globe right now.

Both convertible (need that for illustrations). \n\nI'm super unsure if 12,3\" will be too small for work, but also of the Lenovo is too bulky, even tho it's only 1,3kg or so. I love the design of the surface go, so thinking of going with the pro, but pro maybe more a target for theft and maybe not as durable... Also more pricy. On the pro side I think it's better to resell. Also nicer as a overall decide to make notes etc.\n\nWhat do you all think. I wish I could get a really good one for my work but I am still too scared of breaking it or it being stolen. :/ currently I have a surface book 2, 15\" that is way too heavy and both batteries are death and touchscreen doesn't work.

  "Would the Lenovo Legion 5 gen 10 be a good buy for a mix of school+gaming ? (ryzen AI 350 / RTX 5060 version) Hi, my question is basically what the title says.\n\nWhat brings the most questions for me is battery life. I already checked benchmarks and know this laptop will be enough for the games I play, but I can't find decent info on battery life. I need it to last a full 8 hours of class, so light use with just browsing and microsoft office basically. I would probably lower screen refresh rate and only use iGPU (if possible) to achieve that, and maybe other optimizations I need to look into. How much battery life can I expect in these conditions ?\n\nI also considered just getting a decent ultrabook with no dedicated GPU and a cloud gaming subscription, but a good ultrabook (asus zenbook 14 for example) is as expensive as a PC with a dedicated GPU, with the only advantage being battery life.\n\nAny inputs on the subject would be welcome, thanks :)",

ThinkPad are better designed and more robust (however, the really good ones are series T or P, the E series is more entry level).

  "T are for professional use, very robust design, good autonomy.\n\nP are more portable worstations, they are more powerful, sometimes with a discrete NVIDIA RTX Ada or Blackwell. Not cheap though.\n\nCompare the characteristics on the Lenovo site, for your price range.\n\nSome things to consider:\n\n* CPU: if you are going to do numerical computing, it might be useful to have AVX512, though I don't think it's mandatory. Check CPU boost frequency, cache size, number of cores and threads, and generation (newer generations have better IPC - instructions per cycle)\n* Memory: DDR5 is faster. SODIMM can be changed, but is typically a bit slower. Nowadays I think 32GB is more future-proof than 16GB.\n* Disk: SSD NVMe preferably. 512GB is not bad.\n* Screen: size, resolution (but higher resolution for small size is not really useful), OLED is better, check % of color space (lower will mean the screen is not capable to render all colors, but not necessarily a huge problem)\n* Battery autonomy\n* WiFi capability\n\nHonestly, for programming, even my IdeaPad 5 with a Zen 2 (5500U) is not bad at all (I have a similar laptop for work, it's a X13 with a 4500U I think), and 16GB RAM is not bad.\n\nBut it all depends on what you are programming: to learn about HPC, a good CPU or even a NVIDIA GPU (for CUDA) would be nice. For AI, a NVIDIA RTX (not GeForce) would be great, but they are expensive.

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Lenovo Thinkbook 14 2 in 1 gen 5 or Yoga 7 gen 10? Currently on the market for a new laptop to replace my 2 in 1 chromebook for uni work and sketching on the go.\n\nBoth of those options seem to be on my budget and seem to be highly regarded.\n\nSo, whilst I'm personally leaning towards the yoga 7 due to better screen, better chip, audio and battery. I'd love to know what everyone else thinks.\n\nThe main advantage I've gotten so far for the thinkbook is slightly better built quality, upgradability (but the yoga I'm looking at already comes with 24gb ram and 1 tb storage) and a built in finger print sensor.",
  "Thinkbook 2 in 1. Better thermals, good ips screen, upgradability."
