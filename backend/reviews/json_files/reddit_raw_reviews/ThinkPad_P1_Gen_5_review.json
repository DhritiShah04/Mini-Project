  "Razer Blade 16 2025 vs Asus G16 2025 vs Thinkpad P1 Gen 8 maybe? Hi!\n\nI'm not a gamer and I don't use laptops to play games. However, I am a programmer and use my laptop to compile some pretty big C++ projects and do some CUDA stuff so I need a good CPU, a decent Nvidia GPU, and at least 64G of RAM. I'm using a Thinkpad X1 Carbon currently and it definitely couldn't handle my workload. So now I'm looking for a new laptop which can handle my workload. Here are my requirements, from most important to good-to-haves:\n\n1. Balance of power and efficiency (battery life) - I often switch between connecting my laptop to a dock/power and bringing it with me on the go so its battery life cannot be a weak point. But I don't really care about benchmark scores. I don't expect it to have macbook-level insane 14-hour battery either. \"Balance\" is what I'm looking for.\n2. RAM at least 64G\n3. Nvidia GPU - 5080 looks like a reasonable choice\n4. Bright screen, since I often work on my terrace in the sun\n5. Other misc stuff like good keyboard, good build quality, etc\n\nBased on those, I've been interested in Razer Blade 16 2025 with 5080 GPU. But then Asus G16 2025 looks also nice. Reviews like [this ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3b17_zTtXc&t=479s)even picked Asus G16 as the better laptop all around, since it has better battery life, better keyboard etc. I've also heard some reports about the reliability issues of Razer laptops such as battery bloating etc. Wonder whether that has improved at all.\n\nBut what I don't understand is, with an Intel i9, how could the G16 has a better battery life than Blade 16 which has a (supposedly) more efficient AMD CPU? Is it because of the power management or throttling that they implement? I always wanted an AMD CPU but this comparison just seems very surprising to me.\n\nI've been a Thinkpad fan but their current laptop lines don't have a decent model that has AMD CPU + Nvidia GPU. (P16v and such look awkward because of those numpads.) P1 looks nice, but its battery life seems questionable. I wonder how G16 pulls off a better battery life. If Asus G16 is a better balance of power and efficiency, I could just wait for P1 Gen 8 since it suits my needs better..?\n\nWhat are your suggestions? Let me know. Thanks!",
  "Would love to know this as well. Since this is posted a few weeks ago, curious to know what you got if you have already made up your mind.",
  "Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024) vs Lenovo ThinkPad P1 I've narrowed my search down to 2 laptops and can't decide which to go with. Which would you recommend?\n\n**Use:** I would mainly use the laptop for data science coursework and occasional gaming (MS Flight Simulator, FIFA, GTA). I want the laptop to last at least 5-6 years.\n\n**Price:** Price is not a factor since I'm not paying for it.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n|-|Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024)|Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 6|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|CPU|Ultra 9 185H|i9-13900H|\n|GPU|RTX 4090|RTX 4090|\n|TGP|115W|105W|\n|RAM|32 GB|32 GB|\n|SSD|2 TB|1 TB|\n|Display|2560x1600 240Hz OLED|2560x1600 165 Hz IPS|\n|Battery|90 Whr|90 Whr|\n|Power|240 W|230 W|\n|Dimensions (cm)|35.4 x 24.6 x 1.74|35.95 x 25.38 x 1.75|\n\nBoth have vapor chamber cooling. I like that the ThinkPad doesn't look like a gaming laptop and has lots of reviews, whereas the Asus is brand new. ThinkPads are also known for their reliability.\n\nI like that the Asus is slightly smaller, has a higher TGP, an OLED display, slightly better CPU, and a higher refresh rate.",
  "Despite similar specs, the two target very different audiences.  If your priority is gaming, the G16 should get you better graphics performance and will have the better screen (although both will have excellent screens), better speakers, and also include a lot of tuning software allowing you to adjust power limits, fan curves, keyboard lighting, etc.  You will also benefit from a large online gaming community with loads of tips on how to optimize your computer/gaming settings.  If you use the laptop professionally and care about a clean/muted look, best-in-class keyboard, Thinkpad support, then go with the Thinkpad.  I, for one, love the Thinkpad Trackpoint (red nub) so will always go with the P1 if the specs are the same.  But it is getting tougher and tougher to choose as Asus has really done a good job making the ROG Zephyrus line pretty clean and sleek.",
  "+1 for Zephyrus, but consider where you’re buying it from. \n\nI love ASUS laptops/products but their support can sometimes be lacking. If you’re in the US, get it from a reliable 3rd party reseller like Bestbuy, MicroCenter, etc.",
  "Thinkpad or Zephyrus My current laptop (Surface Book 2 13.5) is still doing quite well but I'm looking to upgrade, mostly because of performance restraints and reliance on cloud for ML tasks. I work with applied AI but all the tooling I need from work is provided, but I want to have more power for my tinkering outside of work.\n\nI have narrowed it down to 2 options: The Lenovo Thinkpad P1 Gen 7 or the Asus Zephyrus G16\n\n\n\nThe Thinkpad is on sale for £1800 with the following specs:\n\nIntel® Core™ Ultra 7 165H vPro® Processor\n\n4060 8Gb 60W\n\n32Gb (upgradable, but expensive to do so)\n\n1Tb\n\n16\" 3840x2400 IPS 60Hz\n\n\n\nAnd the Zephyrus G16 is more modern and also not on sale (\\~£2650) with the following specs:\n\nIntel® Core™ Ultra 9 Processor 285H\n\n5070ti 12Gb 120(?)W\n\n32Gb (soldered)\n\n1Tb\n\n16\" 2560 x 1600 OLED 240Hz\n\n\n\nMy usage consists of the following:\n\nMy laptop goes about 13 hours between long charges, with 4-6 of those being light usage (coding/web browsing/reading and highlighting academic papers) and the rest is just idle with screen off and shut. I can charge it with a very low wattage USB-C connection when out. When I'm at home and I have the main charger I will often be hooked up via USB-C to an external monitor, I'll do more coding and web browsing but I'll also be running ML models (mostly Graph Neural Networks and Multi Agent RL - not LLMs). I also don't train locally, but having the ability to prototype small models before I send it up to the cloud and leave it to train would be useful. I do also want to perform data processing with pandas locally. Aside from that whilst I do game it's only League of Legends/Minecraft so I don't need to worry about running AAA games. I'm looking to use this laptop for the next 5+ years so having longevity in mind is important, although if the Thinkpad becomes outclassed because it is cheaper I'd be okay with upgrading earlier.\n\nI haven't been able to see either of them in person to get a feel for them, and I can't decide off of specs and reviews alone, so hoping I can get some help deciding. \n\nOne final and somewhat important point is I am British, I prefer the English UK ISO layout - which means a big enter key, if that is or isn't possible on the laptop that does have some sway in my decision.\n\nI am also somewhat open to suggestions. I have also considered:\n\n\\- MacBook Pro - but I need windows/WSL and x86 (as well as NVIDIA for local CUDA)\n\n\\- Framework 16 - I don't think the 16 system is mature enough yet, especially for the cost",
  "Consider the Thinkpad T1G? It's the version of this year's P1 (Gen 8) with gaming (RTX 5060/5070) graphics cards. Best of both worlds? Unsure how pricing is over the pond.",
  "Laptop with good performance under $1500? Hello! I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this, but if anyone has suggestions for a laptop, that would be much appreciated!\n\nI am looking for a laptop that I plan on using for normal Microsoft office/researching 60%, Gaming 20%, Movies 10%, and Photoshop/3D modeling 10% of the time.\n\nI would prefer if it could handle some decent gaming as I may use it a bit more for that in the future. Games such as Minecraft or the Sims (even COD games if possible) but it isn't a main concern. \n\nSome main features that I'm looking for are a good screen (touchscreen if possible), decent battery life (5+ hours), and backlit keyboard would be a plus.\n\nI was hoping to stay under $1000 if the laptop isn't super good at gaming, but if one is good at gaming I'm willing to look in the $1500-1800 range as well. \n\nI've looked at the Microsoft surface 7 but have heard some mixed reviews, and I've also checked out the Asus Zen book 14 which seems to have mixed reviews as well. The Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 7 seems like it may be good, so I was wondering what peoples experience are with it. \n\nI'm sorry for the long post, but any suggestions would be super helpful, thank you!",

Any experience or thoughts?** For Dell XPS 15 there are also reports of high fan noise in lighter load, but it seems to me that most people report that it is one of the most silent laptops in this category. Btw. I understand 12700H in these medium sized chassis would be thermal throttled, but I assume perf will still be better than P-series processors in business-oriented laptops (thinkpads, carbons, lattitudes etc). Would appreciate your thoughts or suggestion of alternatives. Thanks for your help!",

  "Looking for a powerful 15 inch laptop, don't need dGPU, ideally a 4k screen with 6-8 hours of battery life, does anything exist? Hey all, struggling to make a decision for a new laptop and looking for advice. I currently have a Surface Book 1 with performance base. It has served me well, but it is definitely at the end of its life. I have gone through some painful periods where the entire system was lagging, including typing in word and gmail, that basically drove me nuts. Because of that experience, I have decided that I really want to go for performance overkill. For work I am generally running large excel files that currently destroy my computer's performance. If I scroll, I have to wait for the data to load, etc - I am not doing any photo or video editing. I would love to be able game, but I would consider that a happy accident and not necessary. \n\nI have been looking at the Thinkpad Extreme Gen 2 for a few reasons. I love the keyboard - and value the typing experience a lot on any computer. The overkill performance I think should be able to handle my spreadsheets. I am definitely committed to a 15 inch laptop, as the 13.5 inch screen makes spreadsheet productivity on the road very difficult. My concerns are the following: 4k vs. 1080p screen. Currently on a 2k 13.5in display with the Surface book, and am worried about going to a bigger display and doing a downgrade on resolution, but am worried about battery life on the 4k screen. For work, I dock into a topre keyboard and dell ultrawide, and that is how I do 75% of my work. The rest of the time is traveling for work - so I am not sure I need the 4k display and feel like the battery life is more important for those days away from the desk. However, for productivity, the screen real estate is super important to me for the large spreadsheets and multitasking, and I am not sure if the 1080p screen makes sacrifices in that department. I recently went to B&H photo and they had a 4k P1 gen 2 out and a T590 in 1080p, and it was a stark difference to me. It the 1080p X1E going to be that much better than the T590? I did play with a few of the gaming PCs, and found the responsiveness very attractive. Lastly, I saw a Surface Book 2 15 and the screen was perfect, the the 15 inch 3:2 is very attractive. But given my experience with SB1, I am gun shy about buying dated super expensive Microsoft products with 2-1 functionality I use once a month.\n\nI feel like I really want 6 core CPU, no GPU, thinkpad inputs, and a 4k display that can last 6-8 hours in non-gpu related work. Reviews have said 3.5 - 6 hours of battery life, which just feels short and risky for a road trip. \n\nLastly, it looks like the X1E gen 1 had better battery life. Is that a better option in 4k? I am weirdly not finding it to be much cheaper than the gen 2? Is it stupid not consider an XPS 15 for my case? Or some other model?\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",
  "From what I can tell, the Surface Book has a 6th gen dual core i5 or i7 CPU. I have a 2013 laptop with a 4th gen i5-4200u, 8GB RAM and 2TB hard drive. Other than a slow boot time (90 seconds) and waiting for all background processes to load including antivirus (about 4 minutes) that laptop operates fine. I use it as a secondary / tertiary laptop while using one of my newer laptops. Replacing the 2TB HDD with a 2TB SSD will solve the boot up times, but a 2TB SSD is greater than the value of that laptop.\n\nMy recommendation is to do a clean install of Windows 10 first to see if that solves your issues.",

  "Hii\n\nIf you're on linux the cpu won't even go above 40°c for general desktop use so the fan won't even spin. It's however not the quietest if you're loading the cpu hard (compiling code, virtual machines or heck even games since the 680m can game pretty well), but nothing too terrible. \n\nOverall on linux it's not even making any noise for most tasks.\n\nAnd yeah, you're not getting anything better for that kind of money. I recommend getting the fat (70wh battery) for best experience.",
  "It's in the bios is dont recall the settings name but you'll find it easily",
  "Is the ram upgradable upto 32 gigs ?",
  "Yeah for sure, the radeon 680m is more than capable for those. But I'd suggest getting an actual gaming laptop if you're only doing gaming.",
  "Hi,\n\nYeah for sure. Still a great laptop. I'd recommend getting the OLED screen if your budget allows for it, it's really worth it in my opinion. Also since the memory is non upgradable getting the 32 gigs of ram is not a bad idea either (and if you can't get both the oled and the ram, get the ram) especially if you're running windows",
  "[removed]",
  "Something around 5-8 hours ? I get 5 because I’m always on HDR at 120hz with the ram set to 7500MT/s (they added a setting in the bios to change it), but I remember getting closer to 7 hours before I did all that, even 8. So with web browsing and programming it’ll last you half a day maybe. It also charges pretty pretty fast.",
  "hi, can you explain why? i've seen a lot of people recommending thinkpads, so i was considering it",

  "Old ones okay maybe if decently priced. Problem are new ones, being super overpriced while offering very little. An example : A mid range T14 G5 with a core ultra 5 125U, 60hz 1200p sRGB IPS display, 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage, which for those two are getting below today's standard, is priced at 1200€. Those are specs you'd find on a 600-700€ laptop, not a 1200€ laptop. At 1000€ you can already get something well built with a Ryzen 7 8th gen, 32gb of ram and 1tb of storage (Asus Zenbook, HP Elitebook, etc). In this case that laptop OP showed was a pretty fine deal, but if you took a Thinkpad for the same price you'd have an E14 Gen 6 with even worse specs. They stay good, don't get me wrong : but at any price range there's pretty much always a better deal.",
  "They still good",

  "Keyboard's alright. As for the burn in, I think it'll be fine, especially if you don't run max brightness (the screen is very bright, even half brightness is much brighter than most laptop screens) and auto hide taskbar. Bonus point if you use a OLED friendly theme (iirc the O365 suite has one where the background and ui is pure black). Those are only preventive measures and not really 100% necessary unless you're really scared.",
  "Yeah, I think it’ll perfectly suit your use. You can even play games on it like Fortnite at native res with amd adrenaline’s capper on 75 at 70 fps, Minecraft at 100 fps, the 780M is great.",

  "so the intel would be the better choice ? between it doesn't have the multi threading capabilities, that's why i hesitate",
  "The ai 7 350 has a weaker iGPU but is normally slightly better than the 8845hs, would be close or even better since it also consumes less.",

  "I have the 16\" version of this laptop.

  ">Low budget Thinkpads (E/L) got mainly shitty screens, this in particular got 45% NTSC.\n\nT series also ships with 45% NTSC screens if you don't select the upgrade. There is also a 100% sRGB option for the E14 Gen 6.",
  "No, recent models are actually pretty good. I have an E16 Gen 2 which is the bigger version of the E14 Gen 6 and it's great. Good build quality, nice hardware, fully upgradeable/repairable. There is even an option for a full aluminium case, even the T series are plastic nowadays. It doesn't feel like a low class or budget laptop at all and outclasses any consumer grade machine like ThinkBooks.\n\nDon't listen to the haters that say E series is trash because they made a bad experience with it 10 years ago. If you get it at a good price, it's a great option.\n\nIf I had to mention something negative, it would probably be that the USB-C ports don't support Thunderbolt or USB4 and that you can't swap the keyboard as easily as in a T series model, you'll have to replace the whole top casing. But tbh, how many people actually ever do this?",

  "ThinkPad P1 vs Asus Zephyrus Hello! I own a notebook like laptop for light development and work on the go (software engineer). But for heavier tasks such as 3d modeling, game development, and AI use I need a beefier laptop **in which I've decided between the ThinkPad P1 models or a Asus Zephyrus model.** Specs aside as I can pick out the one I want, I'm mostly curious on build quality? I own a thinkpad x1 carbon gen 12 as my notebook laptop however I love how the asus laptop looks. Any thoughts on owners of any of them? anything helps, I just want a feel for the quality, noise, power, battery life, and premium quality.",
  "P1 has better build quality, but the Zephyrus is also fairly solid.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the Zephyrus has better battery life due to the ability to toggle the dGPU. Granted, if you are doing any work that requires the graphics card on battery life, you should expect it to be shit no matter what you choose. The battery life of the Zephyrus is really only good (for gaming laptop standards) when not gaming.\n\nP1 is likely quieter as it's thicker and typically uses power-efficient ADA-series nvidia cards built for professional work, whereas the Zephyrus is thinner and has higher-power GeForce cards. You'll get much more performance out of a Zephyrus given that it can have configurations up to an RTX 5080 mobile GPU.\n\n**P1 sounds like what you're looking for. Also check out the P16 and P14 for other mobile workstations from Lenovo.**",
  "There's a huge range of prices and specs for the P1. There's even a last-gen P1 with 4080 GPU on clearance.\n\nFor Thinkpads there's actually a new option: Thinkpad T1g (basically what used to be the T1 Extreme), which uses consumer RTX GPUs. It's more expensive than the Zephyrus but that's a thin, light and powerful laptop.",
  "I appreciate the response! battery life isn't my concern as that's what the X1 is for, just need something with more brute force for heavier workloads. I'm also now leaning towards the P1 although would there be any benefits to the Zephyrus as opposed to the P1?",
  "I was looking at the 4080 one your talking about, really interested in it. Price isnt really my concern its just which one has the better build quality yk? do you have any experience with thinkpads and/or asus laptops?",
  "benefits of the Zephyrus is the sheer amount of power you can get out of cards like the RTX 5080. This configuration costs like $3000 to get a Zephyrus with a 5080, but it'll be much faster and more capable than the ADA card that comes with the P1.\n\nthis is at the cost of power efficiency and stability. the ADA cards like the RTX 4000 Ada are built for workstation workloads, but whether or not this matters to you is another story. Also, I believe the P1 Gen 6 can come with an RTX 4080 if you needed the power.",
  "I've had both the good and bad with Asus. My current Flow X13 has been great except when I needed to replace the fan once. My previous one, not so much. I think Thinkpads will be better on that front even though Zephyrus is not bad by any means.\n\nNote that the P1 on clearance doesn't have great battery time, and the performance is a little lower because of low GPU wattage settings. But it is a good deal for the specs.",

I already checked benchmarks and know this laptop will be enough for the games I play, but I can't find decent info on battery life. I need it to last a full 8 hours of class, so light use with just browsing and microsoft office basically. I would probably lower screen refresh rate and only use iGPU (if possible) to achieve that, and maybe other optimizations I need to look into. How much battery life can I expect in these conditions ?\n\nI also considered just getting a decent ultrabook with no dedicated GPU and a cloud gaming subscription, but a good ultrabook (asus zenbook 14 for example) is as expensive as a PC with a dedicated GPU, with the only advantage being battery life.\n\nAny inputs on the subject would be welcome, thanks :)",

  "Okay so performance wise you give up about 15 percent in multicore and 5 percent in single core performance with the U chip in exchange for around 30-40 percent less power usage.\n\nHowever with the Hs chip you can always limit the power and gain back the efficiency but you can’t increase the power on the U chips.\n\n\nHowever the gen 5 also has a bigger battery and a better screen so I think the performance sacrifice is worth it for the better quality laptop unless you want the bigger screen of the g7",

  "Can I upgrade a Thinkpad P1 Gen 6 Screen from 60 Hz to 165 Hz? I am considering buying this [Thinkpad P1 Gen 6](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadp/thinkpad-p1-gen-6-16-inch-intel-mobile-workstation/21fwsbaj00) on clearance but my only gripe is that the screen is 60 Hz.\n\nI know that Thinkpads are very up-gradable and I saw this [screen on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SCREENARAMA-Replacement-ThinkPad-2560x1600-Display/dp/B0D6X6HLD5?th=1). However, it says that it has and will only fit a 40-Pin connector.\n\nThe Thinkpad I'm looking at has a 60 Hz Screen, so it should only have 30-pins? ChatGPT says I can change the screens as long as I change the display cable, but I have no idea what it means by that.\n\nAny help?",
  "Yes there is some work you need to do you need to check compatiblity (size firmware etc...) plus there is a cable that connects the screen to the motherboard (for power and functionality reasons). The 60 hz is demanding thus the 30 pin. This type of upgrades is not hard but tricky. It's better to consult an experienced technician ( to stay on the safe side)",

I’ve heard mixed opinions.\n\nFrom what I see, the specs are very similar: both have aluminum tops and plastic bottoms. I haven’t seen a huge difference in build quality in real life. But a lot of people claim that newer ThinkPad E-series models are much better now than they used to be—and even better than ThinkBook in many respects.\n\nSo my question is: is it really worth paying ₹7000 extra for the ThinkPad?\n\nIf any of you have observed major differences (durability, thermal performance, screen, support, value, etc.), please drop your experience below. \n\nThanks in advance",
  "My personal preference is the ThinkPad, but I'd probably buy the ThinkBook in this case.  I have the E14 Gen6 (7735U but with the 57wh battery), and I have the ThinkBook 14 G8 (255H) and while the ThinkBook LOOKS better, the Thinkpad is better made.  Beyond that, they have EXTREMELY similar specs, and very similar max specs, so IMO the ThinkPad despite being better made, isn't so much better made that it's worth the extra $$.",

  "The three would make good computers for programming. I'm assuming you don't need a discrete GPU (for AI or graphics programming for instance).\n\nI'd pick the second one.\n\nFirst I'd eliminate the IdeaPad. I have one at home and a ThinkPad at work. ThinkPad are better designed and more robust (however, the really good ones are series T or P, the E series is more entry level). The IdeaPad is good, but given the prices, not worth it I think.\n\nThen it's between the two. I'd pick AMD over Intel, and SODIMM memory. And significantly cheaper than the other.\n\nThe last has better resolution, but it's still a 14\", so pretty useless. It has faster RAM but it's soldered, and it's not a good idea, if you plan to upgrade your computer eventually.\n\nAnother point to note, as it may be useful for you eventually : ThinkPads are often certified for Linux, IdeaPads almost never. Doesn't mean IdeaPads can't run Linux, mine does right now, but you may have problems.\n\nSee this for Linux compatibility:\n\n[https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/pd031426-linux-for-personal-systems](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/pd031426-linux-for-personal-systems)\n\n[https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/liste\\_portables\\_lenovo](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/liste_portables_lenovo)",
  "ok thanks! so if i could get a t16 or p16 which would you recommend? and also amd or intel?",
  "T are for professional use, very robust design, good autonomy.\n\nP are more portable worstations, they are more powerful, sometimes with a discrete NVIDIA RTX Ada or Blackwell. Not cheap though.\n\nCompare the characteristics on the Lenovo site, for your price range.\n\nSome things to consider:\n\n* CPU: if you are going to do numerical computing, it might be useful to have AVX512, though I don't think it's mandatory. Check CPU boost frequency, cache size, number of cores and threads, and generation (newer generations have better IPC - instructions per cycle)\n* Memory: DDR5 is faster. SODIMM can be changed, but is typically a bit slower. Nowadays I think 32GB is more future-proof than 16GB.\n* Disk: SSD NVMe preferably. 512GB is not bad.\n* Screen: size, resolution (but higher resolution for small size is not really useful), OLED is better, check % of color space (lower will mean the screen is not capable to render all colors, but not necessarily a huge problem)\n* Battery autonomy\n* WiFi capability\n\nHonestly, for programming, even my IdeaPad 5 with a Zen 2 (5500U) is not bad at all (I have a similar laptop for work, it's a X13 with a 4500U I think), and 16GB RAM is not bad.\n\nBut it all depends on what you are programming: to learn about HPC, a good CPU or even a NVIDIA GPU (for CUDA) would be nice. For AI, a NVIDIA RTX (not GeForce) would be great, but they are expensive. But for \"simple\" C, Java, or web dev, I don't think you need a beast.\n\nI didn't consider the multiple docker instances: they will run on CPU, so more cores is better. Depends on many instances, and how much they are loaded.",
  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "A brief review of the HP OmniBook X Flip 14 2-in-1 with AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 This is a very brief review of the HP OmniBook X Flip 14 2-in-1 with AMD Ryzen AI 5 340. I don't have the interest to do a full review, and there's plenty of big reviews already out there, so here's the quick version.\n\nHere we go.\n\nI got this laptop for $350 as a Best Buy Open-box return. That was a great deal. I don't think I would pay more than $550 for this laptop but it looks like it's mostly listed between $600-$700 right now.\n\nIt's a lower-mid range laptop that isn't terrible. It would be great for school, work, or if you just can't afford anything better.\n\nThis is a Model 14-FK0013DX, SKU 6613861, UPC 198990145419, BSIN JJGQJRKGHK, Product ID B5UJ0UA#ABA, Product # AK5G4AV_1.\n\nhttps://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-omnibook-x-flip-14-inch-2-in-1-laptop-next-gen-ai-pc-pdk-ak5g4av\n\nThe AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 CPU is a pretty great value. It's performance is better than expected with 6 cores and 12 threads, but it's GPU is a little below average. I'm sure you can play some games, but this isn't a gaming laptop. Unfortunately, the higher CPU performance seems to come at the expense of battery life, but that's not a terrible tradeoff to make. Get a battery bank.\n\nThe 512GB NVME drive in mine is a full size 2280 WD SN500, but you could end up with a Samsung or something else.\n\nThe screen is average. You get what you pay for here and I can't complain for the price. It's a little grainier than I would like, the colors are okay but not great, and the brightness is okay but not great, but it's a good value panel.\n\nThe body is very nice. It has a good look and better-than-expected feel. It is a little heavier than expected.\n\nI am a Linux user, so I don't even bother mentioning any potential Windows issues. You should always do a full reinstall anyway to wipe out all of the crappy OEM bloatware.\n\nAlmost everything worked perfectly in the Linux distros I've tested. Be sure to use something recent. The touchpad, keyboard, and Wifi won't work well without a recent kernel. The one thing that wasn't working was fan sensor reporting, but other thermal information seemed to be correct.\n\nPhoronix has a review of a similar laptop if you want benchmarks. I imagine the results should be very similar\n\nhttps://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen-ai-5-340\n\nhttps://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-krackan-point-windows-linux\n\nIf you want to boot linux, go into the UEFI and enable Boot Options > Enable MS UEFI CA key and disable Secure Boot.\n\n\"Word of warning - disabling Pluton can break suspend/resume\"\n\nThe ports are fine. There's no Thunderbolt, but you get a USB4 port. I wish there was a USB-C port on each side for charging from the right.\n\nFlipping the lid open could be easier. There's nowhere to catch your finger onto to pry it apart.\n\nThe touchpad is a good size and clicks great. The surface is a little rough and it's plastic instead of glass, but it works.\n\n[The one thing I will complain about is the keyboard. I hate it. If you are a touch typist just get something else. If you are slow and don't care, then it's fine.](https://old.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1mytqff/the_hp_omnibook_x_flip_14_14fk0013dx_keyboard_is/)\n\nThe power button is on the keyboard, displacing the DEL key. I hate that too.\n\n~~And finally, the FN key has an LED light that never goes out. It's bugged. There's even a thread about it on the HP support site. You can't turn it off. What's the point other than wasting power and being annoying? Nothing.~~ UPDATE: I was wrong about the annoying FN key LED. It turns off as long as you have it set to \"Auto\" in the UEFI. However, the meaning of \"Auto\" is very unintuitive. It's definitely annoying when it's on though, and there's a reason why almost every other manufacture keeps the two keys needed to turn it on far away from each other.\n\nOver all, this is a pretty good lower-mid-range convertable laptop with a terrible keyboard. If you care about the keyboard, don't get it, or any other laptop with a latticeless keyboard. If you don't care about the keyboard, wait for a sale in the $450-$550 range.",
  "Honestly, the only real downside I noticed with the HP Omnibook X is the display. It’s fine for day-to-day stuff, but it’s not super bright and kinda struggles outdoors. Also, no OLED option so if you care about deep blacks or really punchy colors, this might feel a bit underwhelming compared to other laptops in the same price range. For a machine that nails battery life and performance, the screen feels like the one corner they cut. IDK why! these snapdragon powered devices doesn't work well!",
  "The colors are terrible. The red is orange. I put my color tuned display next to this laptop and the red is totally ORANGE. It's not even close to red.\n\nThe green is a little yellowy and the blue is kind of cyan.\n\nIt works for work but I wouldn't want to use this thing for personal stuff like pictures and watching videos.",

Also open to other suggestions in this range.\n\n**Main use case:** Heavy Excel work, multitasking with Word/Teams/Excel, always have multiple browser tabs open, light editing, and long battery life.\n\n**Option 1:** Lenovo ThinkPad X9-14 Gen 1 — \\~$2000\n\n* **CPU:** Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 258V (LPE-cores up to 3.50 GHz, P-cores up to 4.50 GHz, 32 GB MOP)\n* **RAM:** 32 GB LPDDR5X-8533MT/s (Memory on Package)\n* **Storage:** 1 TB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe Gen4 TLC Opal\n* **OS:** Windows 11 Home 64\n* **Display:** 14\" WUXGA (1920×1200) OLED, Anti-Glare, HDR 500 True Black, 100% DCI-P3, 400 nits, 60Hz (Optional +$150 upgrade to 2.8K OLED Touch, 500 nits, VRR 30-120Hz)\n\n**Option 2:** ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED UX3405CA-PZ163WS — \\~$1350\n\n* **CPU:** Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 255H (2.0 GHz base, up to 5.1 GHz, 16 cores / 16 threads, Intel® AI Boost NPU up to 13)\n* **RAM:** 32 GB LPDDR5X (onboard, dual-channel)\n* **Storage:** 1 TB M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD\n* **OS:** Windows 11 Home\n* **Display:** 14\" 3K (2880×1800) OLED Touch, 100% DCI-P3\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. Which would you pick for my needs, and why?\n2. Is the ThinkPad premium purely brand and build quality or is there something else I’m missing?\n3. Any other laptops I should be considering in the \\~$1300–$2000 range with similar specs?\n\nThanks in advance for the help! I really appreciate it :)",

  "Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 2 - Half Screen Black Issue, Faulty Display or Fixable? Hey everyone, \nI just bought a Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 2 yesterday, but the screen issue is worrying me, as half of it appears black, and the middle part looks a bit whitish. Whereas on a dark black screen, it's fine. I have also run a Display BIOS diagnosis and there on black screen no shade is see.

  "Is the Lenovo ThinkPad E16 gen 2 with HS processors undervolted? If not do they overheat? Hi Reddit, This is Kavin. My laptop had stopped working recently. So I was wondering if I could get a reliable laptop that could last me for the maximum amount of time. Of course, my first preference was to get a ThinkPad. I've done my research across all the other brands and ended up looking at a ThinkPad, which is pretty good in terms of specs. One thing that ached me was that this exact model has a HS processor, which might be undervolted by Lenovo; if not, it might overheat. I've attached a photo of this laptop and its naked back to give an idea of how it looks and show how big the fan and the heat sink are. This is the link to the laptop: [https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nx00](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nx00)\n\nThese are all the variants of the laptop: [https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/len101t0098?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252F&irclickid=xta2FnyEixycWL9XgKWeZxMQUkp20iUiCTv0W00&irgwc=1&Program=9634&pid=5215192&acid=ww%3Aaffiliate%3Alx67i4&cid=in%3Aaffiliate%3Afiv7n7](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/len101t0098?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252F&irclickid=xta2FnyEixycWL9XgKWeZxMQUkp20iUiCTv0W00&irgwc=1&Program=9634&pid=5215192&acid=ww%3Aaffiliate%3Alx67i4&cid=in%3Aaffiliate%3Afiv7n7)\n\n Found a good review: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNkDvzWrEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNkDvzWrEY)\n\n# Uses:\n\nLet me tell you what I'm gonna use this laptop for. I will use it for light gaming, school work (Projects), occasional edits and browsing. I'm not gonna game crazy hard, of course. But I will be playing games like Apex Legends, Counter-Strike 2, etc.\n\n# Expectations:\n\nI'm a 16-year-old guy. I expect this laptop to last me for a period of 5-7 years. I don't want anything like hardware requirements to stop me from doing my work, which is mostly school work, some light games, and university projects. I wanna make the most out of this laptop, so pls put your recommendations on how to use it efficiently or the first things to do on this laptop (pls don't tell me not to play games). In conclusion, I want a smooth time with this laptop.\n\n# Questions:\n\n1. Is this undervolted by Lenovo?\n2. Will it overheat? (Are the thermals good enough to support this processor?)\n3. Should I go for this one instead (Which has Ryzen 5 U processor): [https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nr00](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nr00)\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nI would like to know what you ppl think. I would really like some recommendations that fulfil all my needs around this price range. Pls answer my questions, guys (would really appreciate it). Pls let me know what I'll have to buy(Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7) according to my needs and preferences. Also, feel free to ask me anything you need to know in order to clarify my doubts.
