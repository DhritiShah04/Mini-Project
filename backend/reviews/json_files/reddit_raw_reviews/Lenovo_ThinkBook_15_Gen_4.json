  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience). I have a Lenovo duet 5 now which I love but the snapdragon is feeling a little long in the tooth when I have more than a few tabs open.\n\nI guess my heart says Lenovo but brain said MacBook Air.",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop. Having good speakers is a great bonus for the Lenovo for me, as well as a bright screen. Don't need maximum power as for heavy workload I want to rely on remote desktops.",
  "Check your local best buys, in my area (SE Michigan) the Lenovo is on BB as a used excellent for $530 which is the right price point. So see if you can find one in your area for that price",
  "Unfortunately not near me but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nWhat do you think the chances of the kompanio lasting close to apple silicon?",
  "Not sure, thats a ChatGPT quesiton lol \n\nHappy hunting, hopefully you can find one soon.   I hear that they are high-end Chromebooks with Spandragon x Elite processors coming; I'm hoping they are here just before the holiday season.",
  "Ended up with the m4 MacBook air. It went on sale on Amazon for 750(!) and I can't find the Lenovo near me. Also mixed in the surface laptop for fun but the air just seems too good. Thanks again for your help!",

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",

  "NEVER buy asus laptops they are masters in pc motherboards but recently asus is horrible in laptops and their drivers and everything. for you or generally speaking Lenovo should always be your first option because it is with no doubt the best preformance per value in the market or you could also get a HP which are great but i favor Lenovo. and the ideapad slim 5 is THE BEST option, it has the best build quality and also does not break the bank.",
  "Hard time choosing a new laptop. So I currently am using a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, and am planning on upgrading because: A) It is not powerful enough, and B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nI am a student and will primarily be using the laptop for school work, so it needs to be portable and a comfortable weight to bring with me to and from class. I love how portable my 13\" Air is. I've done a LOT of research over the past two years, but never bit the bullet, but I feel like now is the time, and so I've committed to buying one now.\n\nMy use cases (in order of importance): School, Music Production, Photoshop, Gaming\n\nI don't play a lot of games but it would be nice to have a machine to play some Civ 6 or even some other, more intensive games like BO2/BO3 Zombies (and MAYBEEEE some RDR2) when I am on a plane for a long time. I want something that's decent on battery life, I don't spend all day at school, maybe 4 hours at most on a given day, so I want something that'll last me that long doing just school work without having to even worry about bringing a charger.\n\nNow, I've looked at like tens of laptops, from gaming to notebook, and I've seen some I've considered like the Zenbook S16, Lenovo Slim 7i Aura, Zenbook 14, Zenbook A14, but I've narrowed it down to a couple:\n\nZephyrus G14/G16 - The clear winner for me, problem is it is just too expensive, and the only models that go on sale into my price range are the 4050 G14 and 4060 G16 models which I've heard may not be worth it. They don't go on sale super often, and the ones that do are open box. (Currently can get the 4050 model for $1499 CAD open box)\n\nZenbook Duo 2024 (Ultra 9, 32GB, 1TB, 60hz 1080p model) - I've toyed with the idea of having this laptop for a while. My PC setup at home has 3 monitors and I absolutely love it, and could see myself getting genuine use out of both screens when writing an assignment, key word being WHEN I am doing an assignment, which isn't an every day thing. I don't think it would be powerful enough to handle any gaming at all. Surprisingly, this is actually cheaper than both the G14 and G16 Models I would be getting. (Currently can get it Refurb-Excellent for $1519 CAD)\n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 15\" - This just came out, and I feel like 15\" is the perfect size for me to be honest. I can get the spec with the Ryzen 7 260, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD (will add another in the future), and a 5060 8GB card for within my price range, around $1750 all in. It's around 4 pounds which is the heaviest of the three, but is also the fastest of the three. It's so new that there isn't a single review yet for it. (Brand new for $1750 CAD, could try and haggle it at Lenovo)\n\nThese are my three ideas right now in terms of what to get. Does anyone have any recommendations? Anyone with these laptops have advice?\n\nI'd not like to spend more than $2000 CAD.\n\nEDIT: In case it wasn't clear, this is not meant to be a desktop replacement; I already have one.",
  "Well you need to be aware of the fact that most gaming laptops have a dedicated gpu they are loud heavy and the battery life is 3hours at best and the performance is ass when on battery .\nSo you’ll want something with a powerful igpu like a Ryzen ai 300 series (the Ryzen 7 or 9 models) or the intel core ultra 200 series ( like the ultra 7 258v) these have the most powerful iGPUs currently available. Also their batter life is pretty good.",
  "Don't buy the Zenbook duo. It's more of a gimmick and not a good choice for your use case. \n\nGaming laptops all suffer from battery life. They always need to be plugged in. They don't last long. \n\nYou might want to get something with a modern AMD Ryzen 8000 series CPU. The integrated graphics are good for some light gaming. These CPU are also power efficient so you get good battery life.\n\nAsus Zenbook S16 and Zenbook 14 should be the models to consider. The models with AMD Ryzen CPUs.",
  ">B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nGood luck.",
  "Thanks!",
  "wdym? ive been using windows for my entire life and got a macbook on a whim in 2020 and i can say with certainty that windows is much better (at least for me)",
  "Ok, as I said ... good luck.",
  "Confused between two Which one among the two should I get is the price increase of 3000 INR (35$) justified? Intel version is about 55000 INR (630$) and Amd is about 58000 INR (670$). Also as one of them doesn't have Windows and MS Office I can just get its key for cheap online. I chose these as they have extra slot for Ram and Ssd expansion. Will be using this laptop for 4-5 yrs\nI need it for my college (MBA) so no coding and all also I rarely play any game will use it for watching movie and college work only. I know one is U series and another is HS series both will have different performance but, is the performance worth battery drain for my purpose [Also is that Amd 5 7535HS processor good?]",
  "Intel i3-1215U: what frequency does it reach?

  "Lenovo nerfs it a bit to keep thermals in check. You get steady performance instead of a surge of power then a period of severe throttling. It also helps with battery life.",
  "Well it may make sense but does it really not go further than 2.55Ghz even in plugged in mode?\n\nIs it possible to change the TDP in the BIOS to enable different power limits like 15w, 25w... ?\n\nI mean, form 4.4 to 2.3 that's quite a lot of reduced performance!",
  "lenovo vantage likely offers power profiles, along with the ones built into windows",
  "Thanks, yet I'd rather know for sure before buying, otherwise I may prefer the AMD base one.\n\nIt would be nice if there was a manual for the BIOS so I could check for options.",
  "The 2020 King of Portable 2 in 1s: LG Gram 2 in 1 14 inch **EDIT 4 5 MONTHS LATER:** [New Lenovo Carbon Yoga leaked on it's way, might be just enough to compete with the Spin 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lenovo/comments/hh0xzf/in_the_blink_of_an_eye_it_seems_the_almost/)\n\nEDIT 3: Found the mystery, it's the [Acer Spin 5 13.5](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Acer-Spin-3-and-Spin-5-are-now-slimmer-and-get-a-much-needed-upgrade-to-Intel-Ice-Lake.449311.0.html) inch which comes with 3:2 aspect ratio, not the LG Gram. It's not as a wide as the 14 Gram/c940, but it's about as equal in dimensions as the Surface Book 2 (taller than 16:9 14 inch laptops). For this reason + the almost exact same specs as the Gram, it would make it as a solid contender for the real king of 2020 2 in 1 portables.\n\nSmall note: Lenovo's c940 14 inch recieved a BIOS update which now gives about full 10 hour battery life(4K version, UHD probably gets a lot more), ALSO NOW coming close for that 2020 crown. At this point, it's all up to your tastes to which really deserves it.\n\nOriginal post:EDIT 2: So it seems that the aspect ratio of 3:2 in the Gram 2 in 1 was misinformation from a video, as it's apparently a 16:9 ratio instead. I'd still say this 2 in 1 is one of the best since it actually provides a bigger battery with a lot less weight than normal 14 inch models\n\nOriginal post:\n\nAfter a few companies have tried to make the perfect portable 2 in 1 convertible, LG actually went and finally pulled it off among it's competition with it's new Gram 2 in 1 14 inch announced at CES 2020.\n\nMain strong points:\n\nBigger and better battery life, which promises the highest battery life up to date for a 14 inch (not sure how much it was exactly, but I think it was about \\~70,000 mWh sized)\n\nOnly 2 in 1 to weight around 2.5 lb with that big of a battery and screen, making it's tablet mode really easy to use with maximum weight portability in mind\n\nGreat port selection up to HDMI and \\*Thunderbolt 3 (need confirmation there tho since previous Gram 2 in 1 did not have it, reviewer at CES said it might have it)\n\nAnd lastly, Intel's 10th gen chip with 11th gen Iris Plus Graphics for light gaming\n\nAs of now, only the Lenovo c940 could compete against this in the 14 inch category, but with relatively poor battery life and 0.5 pounds extra, the Gram seems to take the cake here. Honorable mentions I'd put the HP Spectre 13 inch late 2019 refresh (16:9 aspect ratio on a 13.3 inch screen tho, horrible design imo) and the new Samsung Galaxy Book Flex (which is like the XPS 13 2 in 1 but arguably better with some extra features with a 16:10 aspect ratio on 13.3 inch).\n\nMy only worries for the LG Gram 2 in 1 2020 so far: chassis hopefully is as sturdy as the c940 (or close to it since c940 has an excellent chassis durability), speaker system will probably not be as good obviously (c940 has Dolby Atmos 360 hinge, hopefully LG's sound will be not completely bad) and Thunderbolt 3's inclusion. Other than those worries, seems to be on it's way to being the 2020 king of portable 2 in 1's.\n\nNote: Did not consider any 2 in 1 15 inches and above since all have weights more than 4 lb and big form factor (while I would say the new HP Spectre x360 15 2020 is the best new coming relatively portable 15 inch 2 in 1, but weighing at 4 lb with a big chassis not many bags can fit, it would basically come at 2nd best portable 2 in 1 for 2020, in case you're looking in the 15 category. If gaming is your thing in the 2 in 1 category then this new HP will probably best fit your needs).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Small but important note: also worried the Gram might not have Windows Hello IR facial recognition, as that I believe is fundamental for any 2 in 1 to have while utilizing in tablet or tent mode. Hopefully it comes with IR additionally to it's finger print Windows Hello scanner to get the real title of (at least almost) perfect 2 in 1 ultraportable.",
  "I'm worried that the thermals will disappoint. The older LG grams were all a little too hot for comfort, an obvious compromise with the design.",
  "[deleted]",
  "2020 and you can't charge via USB-C. It's so usefull when you can charge laptop, for example in train via simple powerbank with PD.",
  "Valid point, but I'm lead to believe all 2 in 1's suffer from this. As an owner of a Lenovo Yoga c940 UHD 14' and past owner of a 2017 HP Spectre x360 13', can confirm both units had/have issues with thermals and sometimes fans spun up while even being at idle. Thankfully I discovered undervolting which quickly fixed that issue pretty fast, as fans (which were always an issue on c940's) barely turn on anymore with idle temps of 39-44 degrees. Before it would almost be at 54-60 on idle occasionally with Windows doing background processes, but undervolting did the trick just right.",
  "Oh well rip, I guess you're right. I saw a top CES laptops for 2020 video and it had mentioned a 3:2 for the 2 in 1. Can't find the original but now that I see your video up close yeah, that's definitely 16:9. I ain't mad tho since I decided to stick with my 14 inch c940 with 16:9 too so now I know I'm not missing much haha.\nThanks for clarifying!",
  "Late comment but, figured which was had the 3:2 aspect ratio: turns out it's the [Acer Spin 5 13.5 inch 2020](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Acer-Spin-3-and-Spin-5-are-now-slimmer-and-get-a-much-needed-upgrade-to-Intel-Ice-Lake.449311.0.html). If you're interested in buying a 2 in 1, that one is definitely now in the competition thanks to that ratio. Edited main post comment.",
  "I'm pretty sure that you can? Just cuz a laptop comes with a proprietary power brick doesn't mean you can't use USB-C to charge it. I've seen even 15 inch which has proprietary and can still charge with USB-C.",
  "Depends on the laptop OFC. Most 2 in 1s pack really small single fan dual heatpipe coolers which are totally inadequate for anything hotter than a dual core and low end GPU. I think a few 15 inch 2 in 1s with dual fan coolers can be relatively cool under loads, but yea, most do get too hot",
  "[deleted]",
  "I have the 2019 version and charge via USB-C all the time so I'm sure you can do it.",
  "For the case of 15 inch, most of them do provide at least minimum adecuate cooling since they use actual dedicated GPUs for gaming/graphic design. Only reason why I excluded them from my analysis is due to body weight (4lb is honestly a bit too much for a 2 in 1) and screen size makes chassis far too big to carry around conventionally in backpacks for most people.",
  "Haha wow. Any reason specifically you didn't like all the ones you returned? What feature do you find them missing so much to not upgrade your c920?",
  "Hi u/teamblades44, what kind of USB-C charger do you use for something with such a big battery (I mean, can any USB-C charger charge as fast as the proprietary power brick?)",
  "Why do you think 4 pounds is too much? My 14 inch laptop is 4 pounds and I wouldn't say it's heavy",
  "You can use any 65 or 90 W USB-c charger.  I think it charges a tiny bit slower but even when I'm using it it still is charging it rather than discharging.",
  "I classify 4 pounds to be a bit on the heavy side for 2 main reasons (one mostly personal other a bit more objective)\n\n1. I carry my laptop in an over the shoulder backpack with a bit of cables and charging equipment. I used to always carry with me a 1.3 pound battery in that bag alongside my old Surface Pro 5, which gave it a bit of weight to the bag but manageable. With the 3 pounds from my c940 and 1.3 from the battery, I do feel shoulder pain when getting home most of the time, so I opted for carrying it my main backpack separately.\n2. My c940 14 inch at 3 pounds is juuust the borderline of what I would consider ideal weight for a 2 in 1. Using it in tablet mode is roughly hard due to weight + sharp edges which stab a bit into the hands, tho I do find 3 pounds to be good enough that the laptop can be held with one hand a bit relatively easy. But at 4 pounds, I wouldn't see myself ever using it in tablet mode and one hand usage would be on the bare minimum there. This is where the new Gram stands out with a killer 3:2 aspect ratio perfect for tablet mode plus an ideal 2.5 weight\n\nWhile I get this might be more personal since it's 1 pound difference from the c940, I know people like to carry light when on the go, and a 15 inch laptop for me is a bit too much for super portability too. Mostly this is just personal tastes, but a 3:2 aspect ratio with 14 inch wideness honestly would be more than good of a display for any needs I would say imo. It all comes down to personal tastes.",
  "If you use it in tablet mode, the weight doesn't matter...\n\nLike it could weight 10 pounds but that won't really affect how you use it as a tablet\n\nBut for day to day carry, I could totally understand wanting something lighter",
  "It actually does matter quite a bit haha, try holding the tablet in the air as you would an iPad to read and your arms will get tired pretty darn quick. Most reviewers always mention this for 2 in 1's since weight is what normally restricts tablet mode for most of them, except this here Gram which finally fixed the issue in a lot of senses.",
  "You don't hold it in your hands. You place it flat on a table like a tablet or drafting table",
  "As someone who suffers from constant neck pains from looking down too much while studying, holding the tablet in the air both in desk and in bed is a godsend feature for me. Really the only think I'll miss from my Surface Pro 5 tbh, since that only weighs a mere 1.7 pounds. I know other people in my school do this hence why I decided to mention it.",

  "Laptop for Research Work with Specs Close to Surface Book 3 but with 11th Gen i7 or Similar? Current laptop: Lenovo Yoga 910 i7 7500U/16GB RAM/1 TB SSD/4k display \n\nFeatures I'm trying to improve: lack of pen support, webcam placement, processing power, high-pitched fan\n\nI'm a researcher and this would be my main device. I move a lot and so do not want an external monitor nor to switch to a desktop. I heavily use Office Suite, many Chrome tabs, video conferencing, Youtube, Adobe Photoshop + Illustrator, 4k photo editing, moderate video editing, and Python. I do not game at all.\n\nFeatures I am looking for in a laptop: \n\n11ith gen i7 CPU + \\*\\*\n\n32GB RAM + \\*\n\n4k or near resolution screen (not AMOLED) \\*\\*\n\n2-in-1 convertible with pen support \\*\\*\n\nUSB-A port built-in \\*\\*\\*\n\n15\" screen \\*\\*\n\n1080p webcam \\*\n\nBattery life \\~7 hours non-intensive use (web browsing/Youtube) \\*\\*\n\nHDMI port or Thunderbolt cherries on top, but not a requirement \\*\n\nThe closest laptop I have found seems to be the Microsoft Surface Book 3 minus the CPU. I'm rather dongle-averse outside of a USB-C to HDMI converter (so the idea of an external webcam is not the most exciting), so I've nixed the XPS 15 2-in-1. \n\nPrice isn't a consideration really, but sub-$4000 would be nice and I would be willing to go above that if there was a device that had everything above.\n\nAre there any laptops that fit this bill on the market? The closest I can see outside of the Surface Book 3 are the HP Dragonfly Elite G2/Max (but there you have to choose between 4k screen and 1080p webcam) which is \\~13\", Surface Pro 7+ (smaller profile, 1080p screen), and the Elitebook 1040 G8 (720p webcam, estimated delivery date of late July so would be waiting half a year in which time something else could release). I thought there were 2-in-1 Zbooks, but they seem to not be on the HP website anymore/not part of the latest generation and these anyway wouldn't have a better webcam.\n\nI find it kind of ironic that mostly smaller laptops have the specs I'm looking for, so it makes me think that larger convertibles might come to market with upgraded RAM and webcams, the latter especially, in the next cycle. Would that release be in the fall or is there a summer expo? \n\nAm I judging the CPU on the Surface Book 3 unfairly? The reviews online rail about how much worse 10th generation is than 11th and the test graphs seem to support that. I'm coming from 7th gen, but I also want this device to last 3-4 years minimum and don't want to commit to last generation's CPU if something is going to come out with all the specs within a year and I doubt there will be a surprise Surface Book 3 CPU refresh since it just came out. I would also not take advantage of the detachable tablet feature of the Surface Book 3 outside of flipping the screen to cover the keyboard in tablet mode, which is its main feature, so feels like a bit of a waste there? \n\nThanks for any help!",
  "I'm in the same market and haven't really seen anything beyond what you've mentioned. I'll probably just wait around until the SB3 gets a processor refresh.\n\nThe processor refresh on the SB2 occurred \\~1.5 years after the initial release, but hopefully this one would be sooner as there was quite a bit of negativity around the SB3 processors so MS should be quite clear on what they need to do.\n\nAs usual though, if you're always looking to buy the tech just over the horizon, you'll always be waiting.",
  "Dell XPS, HP Spectre x360, or Razer options, ultraportables vs 15 inch models, trying to decide Sorry for the pseudo double-post since I also posted on Suggest-a-Laptop, but in this case I have three laptops that I've researched fairly extensively and want opinions regarding them specifically more so than a person sending me a link of laptops meeting my \"form\" specification.\n\n\\* \\*\\*Total budget and country of purchase:\\*\\*\n\nUSA. Ideally sub-$2k budget, but I could be convinced to spend more for a machine that will last longer, or combined with an eGPU or separate desktop later on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\\*\\*\n\nI don't care about 2 in 1, but my most recent computers have been a Surface Pro and then the late 2016 Razer Blade Stealth with touch. I absolutely cannot get another laptop/hybrid without a touch screen. I use it more than the trackpad. Before that, I used a Thinkpad joystick/nipple, so I've never felt comfortable with trackpads. I currently use my RBS with a mouse/monitor setup, or on my lap with a mix of trackpad and touch screen. Mostly touch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\\*\\*\n\nPrior to the Surface Pro, I had an IBM and then a Lenovo Thinkpad. They started to feel too clunky when I started carrying my computer with me everywhere. I do value something slimmer, something in the ultrabook or lighter weight 15\". (E.G. XPS15, Razer Blade, but not a 17\", and not a fat ugly gaming rig).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\\*\\*\n\nWindows\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\\*\\*\n\n13-15\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\\*\\*\n\nMostly general use, but also would like to be able to play some games, some AI use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\\*\\*\n\nWould be nice to hit at least 60fps for recent games at low-medium settings. Not required for the ultrabook, say, if I got another thin-and-light computer with Thunderbolt connectivity for an eGPU.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\\*\\*\n\n\\-Portability: Ideally portable. Razer Blade 15 is about as heavy as I'm interested in.\n\n\\-Touch: Absolutely need touch-screen. As stated above.\n\n\\-Build quality: I've had some problems with recent computers, so I'm not sold on the idea that one company or another is or isn't great. My IBM Thinkpad after about 5 years of life had issues with overheating despite new thermal paste application (but probably lasted the longest). The Lenovo was never reliable. I switched to the Surface Pro... which was pretty great except for the charging adapter being absolutely terrible and not registering (which I noted with other users as well), and after getting a replacement that worked for some time... it also stopped working very well, and by then I'd run out of memory and wanted something with more I/O... so the Razer Blade Stealth had the expected issue of not registering the battery appropriately, and on day one I had to download a BIOS update (known issue I had seen in one of the reviews when I purchased the computer). I needed to send it in for an RMA due to constant freeze/buzzing issues (they told me they eventually replaced the motherboard). Recently it's been acting up making a loud crackling/buzzing noise (no freezing, not coil whine) that's probably related to the fan, but can go weeks at a time without issue... that's made me reticent to bring my poor computer out in public... Basically I've had a bad experience with Razer, but then again, I've not had the best experience with Microsoft or Lenovo either. Hopefully just bad luck, and the next computer will be a bit luckier...\n\n\\-Ports: I need Thunderbolt since I want the option for an eGPU or a Thunderbolt dock. In the past I've tried a regular USB dock with past computers, and there was too much lag to make it useful. I also want more ports than what Microsoft is offering with any of their new offerings. If they had come up with a Surface Book 3 with updated hardware, I would have been interested. At minimum, I don't want to lose ports (currently USB-C + 2x USB-A and HDMI). XPS 2 in 1 feels ridiculous. One charging USB-C, and one to plug things into. XPS 13 laptop is essentially a step backwards with one USB-C used for charging, one to replace HDMI, would then leave me with one fewer USB port available. Probably fine to get a dock, giving me two USB ports. Spectre 13 similarly loses me a USB port if I didn't have a dock. The new RBS keeps ports, but has other drawbacks. The alternative is getting a 15\" model but losing portability in favor of power and ports.\n\n\\-Memory: I need at least 512GB, preferably NVMe SSD. Would like 16GB+ for RAM, especially for the 13\" models as RAM is usually not upgradeable.\n\n\\-Display: My perfect laptop doesn't exist. If I get a 13\", I don't need to sacrifice battery for 4k since I can't tell the difference anyway, but the only touch options at this size seem to be 4k displays. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\\*\\*\n\nI THINK I've narrowed my list down to two categories, and three options within each (Razer, HP Spectre x360, or Dell XPS):\n\n1. Ultra-portable with plan for a secondary Thunderbolt dock or eGPU\n2. 15\" that still maintains some portability.\n\nUltra-portable:\n\n1. Razer Blade Stealth late 2019:\n   1. Don't lose any ports, maintain a light form factor with improvement in bezels, and actually increased power that would still allow \"light\" gaming.\n   2. The GTX1650 is fine... but comes at the cost of 15w for the CPU, basically throttling the CPU in favor of having a decent GPU. I'm not sure the extra price is worth what really isn't a gaming machine. (Comes in at $1900)\n   3. Honestly would be happy to get an Iris Plus Graphics model, would LOVE Mercury White... but those options are either NOT touch-screen or not 512GB for the SSD. Cheapest touch option (if I am understanding the Razer site) is an MX150 with 8th gen CPU and 4k panel for $1700, and it just doesn't seem to make sense to pay so much for an \"older\" model with a weaker GPU, though true it is an actual dedicated GPU.\n   4. Doesn't have microSD (though I haven't felt like I \"needed\" it as long as I have enough local memory and cloud options).\n2. Dell XPS 13 or XPS 13 2-in-1\n   1. Minimal ports. Boo. But could dock it.\n   2. XPS 13 has the \"other\" Intel 10th gen CPU, so maybe not as optimized for minor graphics/AI? However, it is 6-core, so maybe more powerful. The 2-in-1 uses Iris Plus but is even MORE limited in ports. I am fine with a touch laptop, but if equally viable, I'd go for one that can do full double duty as a hybrid. Again, supposing I use a dock, the port issue is fine? This all assumes that Thunderbolt docks work reasonably well without the lag I've experienced with \"regular\" USB docks.\n   3. XPS 2-in-1 seems to have a non-4k option, which might save some battery life and price.\n   4. Quality control issues?\n3. HP Spectre x360 13, late 2019\n   1. This is what I'm leaning toward. Also lose a port (like the XPS 13), but better than the XPS 2-in-1 and in a similar form factor, with a sleek almost bezel-less design. Would have to dock. Coming in at $1500, so pretty much the cheapest option (or about tied with the XPS13).\n   2. Comes with a pen! lol\n   3. I am having trouble determining if the CPU has 15w or 25w (Iris Plus version of 10th gen). Also not sure if the SSD is NVMe?\n   4. Like the others, only 4k options, though people seem to like the screen, and if the non-touch can reach 22hours (company testing conditions), then the OLED should probably still have reasonable battery life.\n   5. Quality control issues?\n\n15\"\n\n1. Razer Blade 15\n   1. As much as I want one of these, I can't really justify paying $3100 for the cheapest touch option. Unless there's some non-4k, or non-GTX2080 configuration I can get, anything reasonably priced is non-touch. I don't need a fantastic video card, but in the 15\" model, I do want a usable GPU. The reasonably priced ($1700-1800 options) have GTX1060Ti or 2060, but sadly no touch screen. Even with older models.\n   2. Anyone see a perfect Blade out there?\n2. HP Spectre x360 15\n   1. As much as I like the 13 inch model, I haven't really seen any reviews online for the new 15 inch model.\n   2. This is the only 2-in-1 15\" option I'm currently looking at.\n   3. $1700 (or possibly $1530 with discounts), this is the cheapest 15\" model I see among those I'm looking at most closely. However, the GPU seems to be sacrificed, with MX250 as the option.\n3. Dell XPS 15\n   1. This is probably the one I would lean toward. For $2k I could get 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD, lots of ports, GTX1650, touch, on a 6-core 9th gen CPU.\n\nSo basically looking at any experiences people have had with any of the above options. Would love to hear how the new Spectre is working out, if you found a better Razer configuration, if you've had QC issues with Dell or HP or Razer, what you might lean toward. I'm also open to other ideas (I haven't looked too deeply at the Lenovo Yoga models, for instance). I love the Surface lineup in general, but I feel like I'm probably getting more for my money with these options... though it would be nice to have an actual brick-and-mortar option for when any problems arise.

  "Most likely true. I work at a very large company and work in picking and shipping orders, and it's generally the same for every company. If a product is in stock and is purchased, the order is automatically added to the queue and dropped in the next wave of orders for the warehouse workers to pick and ship it. \n\nMany times the packlist/order receipt will show the total price of the order, but nobody really pays attention and even if a warehouse grunt sees it, they will assume nothing and still send it out. No managers or financial workers will see the order until well after it is shipped and delivered in most cases",
  "I have worked at a popular grocery store for over a decade. In the U.S. if a store has a price sign in front of a product that indicates an incorrect price, we have to honor it. Otherwise it’s called bait and switch. I have no idea how this is handled online or internationally however.",
  "They don’t. Law undergraduate here. This falls under contract law. A website listing or product is considered as an **invitation to treat**, and not an **offer**. To define an offer, I will quote it from the case of Preston Corpn Sdn Bhd v Edward Leong: An offer is an intimation of willingness by an offeror to enter into a legally binding contract. Its terms either expressly or impliedly must **indicate** that it is to **become binding on the offeror** (buyer) assoon as it has been **accepted by the offeree** (seller).\n\nEven if the customer were to send an offer (by checking out), a **binding contract** is not yet formed because Lenovo has yet to accept that offer and they can choose to back out as there is no **legally enforceable agreement** yet. (A confirmation email is also not signifying of acceptance of order!)\n\nA similar example to this would be Chwee Kin Keong v Digiland Mall Pte Ltd. TLDR is that an employee keyed in a pricing for a product at $66 instead of $3,854 (MSRP) and the company obviously didn’t want to fulfil orders that were made and got taken to court. Court ruled in the company’s favour.\n\nIn consumer court, courts do consistently rule in favour of the seller during obvious pricing mistakes like a $1 phone etc. because they take the view of a **reasonable person in consideration and apply the objectivity test**. \n\nFor example, in this case, the court said:\n“I find ... that the plaintiffs, given each of their backgrounds, would in any event, each have separately realised and appreciated, before placing their purchase orders,that a manifest mistake had occurred – even if no communications on the error had taken place between them. Further, the character of the mistake was such that **any reasonable person** similarly circumstanced as each of the plaintiffs would have had every reason to believe that a manifest error had occurred.” . \n\nOtherwise, the court would also simply treat it as a **clerical or unilateral mistake** and not punish the seller. Similarly in this case, Lenovo would win.\n\nIf there’s any Law graduates reading this and want to improve on my stand, please do! I’m still studying and open to improvement",
  "Nope where it's clearly a mistake and you know it, they don't need to honour it",
  "They are not and three seconds of googling will support that. Just because you once managed to slip one through doesn’t mean that’s the law.\n\nImagine a computer store mislabelling a €4000 laptop at €1 and a large amount of units are ordered overnight while nobody’s at work. Your argument is that EU law now effectively forces this company into bankruptcy by being required to honor these sales that were clearly made exploiting an error in pricing?",
  "No....",
  "Depends on the Ts and Cs",
  "Yeah.... depends on if that's enforceable to a website in another country.... Much like the GDPR fines the EU charges.... a US website isn't subject to that....  even if they decide to keep data on you... because they're not breaking THEIR laws.",

  "True, but I was just giving an example to explain. However, if we look at it in layman terms, the universal legal principle will be the same. You simply cannot reasonably expect to enforce a contract based on a price that is **obviously an error**. So in any jurisdiction, I’m highly confident that Lenovo would win should this be taken to court. \n\nIf you search up similar topics, you will find that across common law (Singapore, UK, US) and civil law (France, Germany, EU), the courts follow the same reasoning:\n1.\tObvious pricing errors = no binding contract.\n2.\tBuyers cannot exploit a mistake they recognize.\n3.\tThe worst that happens to the retailer is refunding the money.\n\nHowever, if we are referring to say, a $599 MSRP laptop being listed erroneously at $499, the court may order the seller to honor some of the orders, which has happened in many jurisdictions before, since borderline errors (e.g., 10–25% off normal price) can be interpreted as a discount/promotion and would lead a reasonable person to believe that there is no mistake in pricing.\n\nIn this case though, it’s a laptop for $1. So it’s pretty obvious and no court would side with the buyer.",
  "Incorrect.\nTL;DR Lenovo (and most other companies) explicitly states that a confirmation email does **NOT** signify acceptance of the order. **No acceptance = No contract.** (This clause is commonplace for every business) Consumer will lose if he tries to go to court, even if he has the best lawyer. Below, I will cite Lenovo.\n\n**Full explanation:**\n\nA confirmation email, if you dig deep into any businesses’s Terms and Conditions (the thing that everyone ignores), has built in protective clauses in their Terms of Sale, and they’re not obliged to provide the consumer with any goods or service with a confirmation email alone. **Confirmation email ≠ acceptance.** A confirmation email only signifies that they have **received** the order.\n\nHere, I will specifically cite for this case, Lenovo. Under their T&Cs, it clearly states that **a confirmation of Lenovo receiving and/or processing your order does not constitute acceptance of the order.** (1.2)\n\nSource: https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/legal/new-products-and-warranty-services/?srsltid=AfmBOop9YcXqtlgbWWSEtLd4WCy7paTFtCMABKIs8xZmfYyPvIBRyTbc&ut\n\nIt also states under 1.1 that:\n\n1.1) **No contract** for the purchase of Products or Services will be formed until Lenovo accepts your Order by **one of the following**:\n\n**(a)** shipping the hardware Product and sending you a shipment confirmation email; or\n\n**(b)** making the software Product available to you; or\n\n**(c)** providing the Service to you.\n\nTherefore, that confirmation email is **not a binding acceptance** and is more of an acknowledgment that they’ve received your order and are processing it. Until shipping occurs (or software is delivered, etc.), Lenovo **reserves the right** to cancel or adjust your order **even if** you’ve already received a confirmation email or any other form of confirmation.\n\nI personally think that TV shows these days make the law seem very shallow to the average person, like; “Little guy sues company and wins!”. \n\nThe reality is, that every business has multiple built in protective and failsafe clauses layered into their contracts etc. to make sure that real consumers **will never win against them** in court. I feel like the average person should read more into the T&Cs so they know what they’re getting themselves into, but we don’t, so companies take advantage of that; and that is why we have lawyers :)",
  "Do enlighten me. 99% of companies in the EU are labeled “micro scale”.

  "Can I play GTA V on this? Can my laptop handle GTA V? and will it run smoothly?",
  "thanks a lot for your replies guys. This laptop was a gift from my mom and she just said it was what the saleslady recommended her, and so far, its been running smoothly (been playing league and genshin on it.) I guess i just have to try installing GTA V on it.",
  "Don't listen to people saying no. Yes you can. It won't run at the highest settings but you will be able to play at decent fps. They forget GTA V is basically 10yo at this point and very well optimised. However if you plan on buying this laptop for gaming, please buy something else. But if someone offered you this and you wonder if GTA V will play, yes it will.",
  "Yes you can, i have no idea on why tf people here are telling that you can't, just look up on yt, even with integrated graphics you can run this game, maybe not on 60 FPS on FHD but 900p probably.",
  "GTA V is 10 years old at this point plus it’s fully playable",
  "Actually yeah\n\nMy 8th gen i5 on my 7490 runs it on 720p low at 30 fps,this will definitely do 60, Iris XE is so much better",
  "yas, in HD resolution medium setting",
  "I think you need to define \"run smoothly\" based on what you need in order to get definitive answers. Right now it's all over the place.  From what I gather, you can indeed play it, but only at subpar graphics. To many, that's a no.",
  "Yeah, an older 11th Gen Intel cpu with weaker Intel Iris graphics runs this game at 1080p high at 45-50 FPS. It's pretty reasonable you could get it to run 60fps with this CPU.",
  "Yes you can at lower settings and also use any laptop stand with good airflow otherwise you will destroy your laptop",
  "it should run GTA5 pretty well for a few years",
  "Literally any 'gaming' laptop can run gta 5 because it's a fucking 10 year old game",
  "gta v runs on pretty much anything",
  "It won't run well, but it will run.",
  "Yes as long as your settings are relatively low",
  "yes",
  "yea bro you good",
  "Possibly but not really smooth \nYou'll have to play minimum graphics and it might struggle to get 60fps. integrated graphics suck even with decent chips",
  "Yes you can just not at max probably around low to medium settings but it will run smoothly i had a decade old asus pc with an pentium and gt710 with 4gb ram and it ran smoothly and your laptops better than that so it should run",
  "Yes it will run but not as smooth as you imagine. But it's better to avoid playing AAA games in that Laptop. 13450H with no dGPU and playing heavy games will result in worst thermals. IdeaPad 3 series is not  good for Gaming.",
  "OF COURSE! 13th gen. Wow way to go!",
  "Crysis 2",
  "While you can, you shouldn't. \nBecause the experience won't be as good as one with a discreet GPU.",
  "Not at the highest settings but you will",
  "Yes but not the best or not GTA online. try 720p low settings",
  "Yes it should run alright but only one way to find out",
  "You can, at medium-high, 50-70fps ave.",
  "It can run it.\n\nI run GTA 5 on a intel n97 at 720p and get around 40to 52fps on story and around 30 to 40 online on lobbies higher than 16 players if 16 or under it's nearly the same as story mode.",
  "Yes in low specs, maybe mid",
  "On low settings yes.",
  "If you absolutely must play on it you should downgrade to patch 1.27 of the game because it is better optimized and run smoother for the singleplayer experience. The modern version is a lot laggier due to unoptimized updates being added to the online experience that doesn't benefit the singleplayer experience at all.  However if you want to play online you must use the latest version",
  "Yes",
  "Not with the highest settings but you could",
  "How much is this laptop? If it's not cheap then consider paying 50$ or 100$ more to get a laptop with a external gpu that can provide much more performance almost like x5, if the difference between playing gta v on lowest graphics on 40 or 30 fps and playing gta v on maximum graphics and 100+ fps is just fifty or a hundred dollars then go for that upgrade and you'll never regret it\n\n\nFor me, laptops like the one shown in the picture and such specs, such laptops are being sold here for around 500-550$ while they only have an igpu!!\nI bought my hp victus 15 for 575$ and it has an rtx 3050 and core i5 12450h \n\nAbout 25$ difference in price, but the difference in performance? Not even close, isn't that ridiculous?\n\n\nI'm glad I didn't rush to buy the igpu laptop otherwise I would have regretted it forever, likewise I recommend that you do some research about the prices in your area and weather the prices of external gpu laptops and igpu laptops are close so you can know what to choose and don't rush",
  "Given the I5-8250U can, I'm willing to say yes.",
  "Yes",
  "It will definitely struggle since Intel's iGPU has always been shit with games, but yes it can run GTA5. Whether it can be played comfortably or not, it is relative to your own opinion about it after trying that yourself. Personally I wouldn't be comfortable with that, but you do you.\n\nPerhaps you might wanna opt for Ryzen-based laptops.",
  "Yes definitely. You don’t have a dedicated GPU though but it should run.",
  "Yes. I sure hope a 2022 CPU runs a game from 2013 for the PS3 well",
  "I've played it on i7 5500u with \"dedicated\" gpu which was as powerful as Intel HD graphics. 😆",
  "Yes, but not well. Here's some tips for performance.\n\n1. Turn all settings to low (obviously) \n2. Play around with the resolution and get a balance of visual quality and fps (960p is usually a great balance of both)\n3. If you're still getting unplayable fps look in to optimization mods, just make sure you install One from a legitimate source\n4. Lock the fps, stable 30fps is WAY better than 40fps with abysmal frame times and stutter",
  "If you tweak the INI to not run shadows and stuff and on 720p you can get it to run on steady 30 fps just cap the frame rate with Riva tuner and stuff and know your ways",
  "Oh hell yea it will run great",
  "Are you planning to play with any sort of mods (locally installed or FiveM)? No.\n\nAre you planning to play only the story mode? Yes.\n\nAre you planning to play vanilla multiplayer (GTAO)? Kinda. Expect some hiccups.",
  "I think you’d be able to play GTA V just fine, not spectacularly, but fine! It should run enough to be a decent experience.",
  "Everything can",
  "Yes ofc \n\nI play on a 10yo laptop no problems here for you man",
  "My Lenovo G50 could run it. I finished the entire game with no issues iirc. The only part where frame rates become an issue is in some GTA online heists. Some interiors are badly optimized",
  "Can you? Probably.\nWill it be a good experience? Probably not.",
  "Turn down the quality and maybe the Resolution a little, however this should work out if you really want to play the game, not gawk at the graphics.  Have fun!",
  "Will it run yes will it run well not exactly not saying the laptop is bad the issue is it has no decaded gpu but I think it should run at 720 or low settings",
  "I have a 5 year old basic nitro 5 that runs GTV 5 on lower settings with no issues. I even played the Lara Croft remake on it with no issues, just the first one.",
  "Not really",
  "Yes. Full hd, low quality",
  "GTA V is one of those games that didn't really ever require a fast PC when new.\n\nYour PC should run it very well actually.\n\n\nI played it on first gen iris graphics (8259u) on a mini PC I bought as a emulator box. It did well even back then",
  "Yes. Not only GTA V. But many other open world games with good graphical quality (I guess Batman: Arkham Knight would be peak)...",
  "Cool mom!",
  "Gta v is incredibly outdated at this point so you could probably run it on a potato. It probably won't run great without a discreet cpu but it should run.",
  "It’s good. If you find yourself running out of storage all the time you can get an extra m.2 SSD",
  "You can but I wouldn’t recommend it, GTAV has been a pain in my ass trying to run it on my laptop which is both new and a beast. Not the laptops fault though, it’s rockstars as far as I know.",
  "It’s by far the worst laptop you can buy for gaming with integrated graphics and a U chip (being power efficient)\n\nThat being said, it does run GTA 5 AND it’s very long battery life allows it to double as a school workstation. I was rocking something similar for 4 years",
  "use geforcenow or any other game streaming no need for gpu...",
  "There was a website called pcbenchmark look up there for any game you wanna install on your laptop",
  "Yes, yes you can",
  "Gta 5 would run fine under medium settings. Intel integrated graphics have come a long way.",
  "Love your mom and respect her as much as possible.\n\n# Paradise lies under the mother’s feet",
  "GTAV was very cpu intensive back in the day. GPU demands start when you start pushing the graphic enhancements. you have integrated graphics, so its you have “the basic”. but it doesnt mean its bad. so dont worry, you have a 13th gen cpu, it will handle it just fine. just start on the lowest settings and start pushing it till you start losing smoothness in the gameplay. have fun!",
  "this is a really nice laptop for school. i would want to have it",
  "It should. A lot of work actually went into making GTA a playable experience on lower-end hardware.\n\nThis one is new enough that the integrated GFX should be able to handle 720p Medium or 1080p Low. I know you can get it running though, because I managed to get it to launch on an i7 4790 from like a decade ago running integrated graphics.\n\nThis will however depend on the thermal solution for this machine. That's where you will likely encounter issues, since it is a slim model. To be fair though, thermal issues aren't uncommon on these types of laptops.\n\nTL;DR: Hardware is adequate enough, cooling may not be. You'll have to test it for yourself to make sure.",
  "I did a ton of gaming on Intel Integrated graphics on my i5-11 laptop CPU. \n\nYou have to play on borderline potato graphics sometimes, but you can get away with a lot of games.",
  "Your mom is so sweet and amazing ❤️",
  "My bro runs bmw on i5-10th gen without gpu on low settings",
  "Yes.",
  "The mother of the son was very kind",
  "What you could've done is type \"i5-13420h gaming\" in youtube",
  "Life-affirming comments on this thread. Enjoy your games :)",
  "You can but you won't get good fps. I play the game with a 1650 gtx and an i5 11300H. I get an avg fps of 50-55 in dense regions and around 65 in open regions at high-med settings. Brand new/post servicing, I was getting 65 in dense regions and 75 smth in open regions. These aren't bad scores but you can pretty much guess that if with a dedicated gpu, I am getting average performance, you cannot really expect too much out of an integrated one.  Moreover, it isn't like you'll be servicing your laptop every week. There'll probably be some here telling you not to listen to us. Your choice at the end who you wanna go with.",
  "Even steam decks can easily handle GTA 5, so yes, just play with the settings",
  "You can run it but it will run like sh1t is the honest answer.",
  "What about amd a10-7300",
  "Without a doubt, definitely you can.",
  "If core 2 duo can, then this baby can as well.",
  "Well I played on my Ryzen 3 3200u with 8 GB Ram and HDD. You easily can.",
  "Pawn it for $200, go get ur dick wet and call it a day.",
  "It will run on medium and about 50 fps , but I think its a business type of laptop not suited for full hardcore gaming",
  "Story mode yes",
  "I have a i7 13700H and I can play war thunder at over 90 fps, it will definitely run gta 5, in the low-med settings, but never the less it will run.",
  "Well what’s the GPU? Everything else is fine, but a good nvidia graphics card would be optimal",
  "GTA V runs fine on 13 y.o. CPU and GPU from 2013. This should run great!",
  "it ran on intel hd 4000 graphics for me, thats a 2012 laptop with integrated graphics, it was good enough for my sister to play so itll run just fine for you",
  "I still run it with i3 laptop intel uhd graphics 12 gb ram and no sdd in an hdd. So you definitely can run it.",
  "Probably. You will have to play on all lowest settings, but u might get 40-50fps\n\nIve ran gta 5 on a dell latitude that was an 1.5 inches thick and had a mobile 3rd gen core i7",
  "Gta works easily. Im running gtav on a amd quadcore with 16 gb and a 3 gb radeon 7950. Im sure u will be fine.",
  "yeah probably",
  "Sorry, but how much did you pay?",
  "Yes, probably at low settings",
  "maybe",
  "ya gta 5 runs on just about everything (very well optimized) so your good at low or medium settings, the only thing that's holding you back is lack of gpu.",
  "Probably not well",
  "Probably at 1080p low or somewhere in 900's.",
  "First-hand exp here: I installed GTA V on my 10th gen i5 w/ integrated graphics. It does run okay at low settings. It can get a little choppy at times. I didn't play long since it was more me doing it 'just to see' how it went, so I can't speak for long-term play. But I did play part of the opening mission and it was okay.",
  "Yea",
  "test it and find out the best solution",
  "You could probably run it well at 1280x720.",
  "used to play pretty well on a amd x4 860k and a 750ti. a 13th gen intel CPU will have no trouble (even using integrated graphics.)",
  "You can, just limit to 60 fps and that's good or limit to less if you want to.",
  "1080P, normal settings, lock your FPS to 30, and have fun. Sure it won't play with the highest graphics, and not at 60fps either, but it will play better than the consoles it launched (PS3\\\\XBOX 360)\n\n  \nIf you don't lock your FPS it might even go closer to 60 in some places, dropping in others... It's your choice. Anyway it's totally  playable, not the best experiencie in the world, but TOTALLY PLAYABLE.\n\n  \nSource: I literally benchmarked this GPU (Intel Iris XE 80EUs) a few days ago...\n\nDepending on the cooling in the laptop you might even go high settings and mantain 30 FPS :)",
  "I think it could work and that was very nice of your mother, please treasure it!",
  "Yes it can but obviously not on high settings, prolly mid..",
  "It has 128MB of VRAM so I'd be surprised if you could.",
  "IDK about GTA 5 but if it's anything like 4 even if the computer's hardware can handle it, the game still might be 80% broken lol. Rockstar doesn't do well with PC gaming since San Andreas",
  "im pretty sure you can run gta on like a fancy toaster if you wanted to, the game is over 10 years old",
  "Yes but low graphics and resolution.",
  "Smoothly on standard settings. Make sure to turn anti aliasing off, that hammers down on performance on the most powerful PCs.",
  "No not atleadt with good graphics",
  "Probably not very well.",
  "If you have GTA V there is no reason not to give it a shot. And if doesn't work but you are describing, you can always try to tinker with the game.",
  "maybe in 720px you can",
  "Use fsr and run everything",
  "In low settings I don't see why not. PS3 could run GTA 5.",
  "Simple answer is yes, complicated answer is not really",
  "Absolutely! The iGPU is powerful and recent. Can play at 1080p medium settings.",
  "I got the same model but imo it's playable on low settings but expect some lags at some point. I've had tons of games played with it and I don't have a problem with such lags like it's not playable as long as it's on low settings. I'm about to switch to a gaming laptop because mine is 5 years old already and I need it for rendering architecture stuff.",
  "yeah, but not at the best settings",
  "Yes but not very smooth",
  "Most definitely can. I have the same specs, except I have a 2060, and the game runs very smoothly even with all my LSPDFR mods. You will have no problem.",
  "Does a bear shit in the woods?",
  "You can, but since GTA VI is about to drop this year, and probably getting a PC version in 2026, i would invest on a laptop without Integrated GPU.",
  "Yes it should run most older titles just fine at 1080p -720p",
  "It’s not necessarily a gaming laptop but if you tweak the settings right on GTA it’ll run.",
  "GTA5 came out on the PS3... That thing had ddr3 gpu memory at 256mb... a whopping 26 shader cores. yours has like 256. If you want to play gta I bet it would run at 720p totally fine, you can 100% play it.",
  "Time for install Linux on it for the superior gaming experience",
  "GTA 5 is technically a game which was at first made to run on the (by today's standards extremely potato) hardware of consoles like the Xbox 360 or PS3.\n\ni do feel like the PC release of GTA 5 is more closely related to the XONE enhanced edition.\n\n\nwhat im trying to say is that if you lower the settings, you will definitely get a smoothly running game, which might even not look like absolute crap. \n\n\nalso, don't quote me on this, as i haven't used a modern Intel CPU since uhh... the 3rd gen, but i did hear that the ones with Iris XE graphics are surprisingly good for integrated graphics. not sure if Intel still uses them in newer chips or if they just shoved a lower power Arc unit in them. so it really depends on what graphics are integrated into your CPU \n\n\nbut just know that people got GTA 5 to be playable on much worse hardware, so i wouldn't worry too much about it.",
  "If you prefer lowest settings then yes",
  "Integrated graphics!?!?",
  "Install it and you'll find your answer.",
  "No.",
  "With enough tinkering, anything works on anything.\n\nNo worries, you’ll make it work. 💪",
  "definitely, i could play online at 60fps on a 3rd gen laptop i7 and nvidia gt 635m graphics. granted it wasn’t pretty but 60fps is 60fps",
  "Reminds me of the past, enjoyed playing GTA V on i3 10th gen U series processor & 8gb ram",
  "it can because its a 13th gen , integrated graphics can handle a 10 year old game.",
  "Gta 5 came out on the ps3 just remember that",
  "Install it and tweak the settings, no reason why you can’t! Everybody is so entitled nowadays with 10 year olds already having super fancy gaming PCs. I swear when I was like 11 with my AMD liano APU powered laptop that was all I gamed on for a few years until I saved up money for a pc",
  "Just take a 1TB SSD because OS + Steam (or Epic games Store) + Rockstar games Social Club + maybe other games. and FYI, to know exactly of your PC can run the game, go to [pcgamebenchmark.com](http://pcgamebenchmark.com) : enter your components or make it detect and you're done =)",
  "Technically yeah, but will it be enjoyable? Probably not.",
  "We would need more info than just “integrated” for GPU. But the processor and memory are good enough.",
  "Yes",
  "Not well.",
  "yes, my friend played gta on a 2013 pentium laptop with igpu, granted he had to manually disable foliage and effects and play at 600p, but this is a spaceship compared to that setup",
  "No",
  "Try running a quick pcbenchmark exe file on it and find out yourself, you can also check some more games in there. It's been a useful tool for me.",
  "Without a discrete GPU, you will not be able to run it very well at all I would think.",
  "yup 1080p with low settings",
  "You can run GTA with half that prob lol",
  "You absolutely can just keep in mind that it’s probably not going to the the best experience ever if you had a 4090 and what not. But you probably already expected that. As long as you’re having fun, that’s all that matters",
  "It’ll definitely run it. You will need to play with settings to get it to look smooth. With integrated graphics I would expect mid settings or lower end of high. Definitely not ultra.",
  " No",
  "GTA V will run on a rock",
  "Nice gift!\nAs for GTA V, itll run, but don't expect miracles, or high settings/resolutions. It would need a dedicated GPU for that, or a reaaally good integrated GPU. As far as im aware, its iGPU is decent, but not high end.\n\nTL;DR: yes, go ahead play GTA V, itll run at 720-1080p with low-medium settings at around 45-60fps. Youll want to play around with the settings and find the optimal mix of settings your eyes prefer. (Some settings increase visual fidelity more than other settings, while using less power than other Settings.)",
  "I run gta with intergrated graphics 16gb ram and i3500h gonna try it again to see if I average 80 or 90 fps",

  "Hell Yeah, great game btw",
  "fuck no. salesmen raw dogged your mom. I'd cuss em out.\n\nnaw fr I'll never get these. they're a niche usage.\n\nyou can get a laptop with a gpu for cheaper than most business laptops. and they'll perform better. cause the offload of the cpu.",
  "It says integrated gpu. GTA won't run very well on integrated graphics. You need a discrete gpu.",
  "Just for fun I ran GTAV on an aspire 5 with an i5 10210U/8GB ram, and at 720p normal settings. I was getting 30+ fps. Don't remember if I tried 1080p or not.\n\nI'm sure this 13th gen i5 can run GTAV at 1080p normal settings with a decent framerate while plugged into the power brick. You also have 16GB ram so even better.",
  "Hell yea. I'm running it on a i5 9300h and a 1660mobile. Runs fine at 1080p.",
  "Kitne ka mila",
  "you can try it just do not expect any high settings since its integrated graphics. I had a laptop in the past with a 10th gen i5 and I was able to run GTA V on lowest settings and 720p. Yes 720p is quite a blur on a laptop but hey, you gotta make do wih what you are given. With the 13th Gen you could probably go on 1080p lowest or at least 900p if GTA V has the option for 1600 x 900.",
  "I managed to run GTA v on an i5 coffee lake (I forgot which gen that is) Thinkpad and on the lowest settings it was actually playable",
  "Bad purchase you could have a got a gaming laptop at this price with dedicated gpu",
  "yes you can!not on the highest settings though",
  "U can technically but at extremely low fps and resolution",
  "I have a worse CPU and i could play it. You might struggle a bit with the integrated graphics card not being able to pull a super good performance graphics wise, but you should be fine running it on low settings",

  "I played gta 5 on older system and it ran around 30 40 fps, lowest settings in online 2 player lobbies. so you are fine",
  "Yes, 30FPS ultra low settings at 720p...\n\nWhy, WHY don't parents ask their children instead of Walmart salespeople?",
  "That's really weird laptop. 13420H is quite power hungry CPU, but it lacks Xe iGPU, which is probably one of the few good things about Intel CPUs. This CPU should be paired with some dGPU, UHD graphics is more suited for lighter tasks.",
  "yes but i think u gotta lower the graphics",
  "at 720p with lowest settings it would play pretty smoothly. but its going to look like actual turds.",
  "No.  Gta V needs a dedicated graphics card.  You will get like 10 FPS on this thing.",
  "I believe in the minimum you can I don’t have sure, but try, if you can’t don’t be sad and play other games you have a lot of good games to this configuration",
  "Theoretically it can, however, if you run too many programs in the background it will bog down the performance to unplayable. I always look for dedicated GPUs (even lower end ones like a 3050) for a gaming pc so I don’t run into performance issues with shared graphics memory.",
  "Yes. But can it play Crysis?",
  "I wish my mom gifted me anything other than 5$ basic tee’s smh",
  "You can play GTA V on Intel HD 530(Intel 6th gen cpus) and above integrated gpus",
  "GTA ran on Xbox 360 and PS3. This is fine",
  "Afcourse I did to just disable the antivirus bcuz that take so much processing and power and plug in the laptop to charger and do the mix power on the battery setting",
  "60fps at 1080p low, probably. You will have to temper your expectations but yes it will run.",
  "Yes! I tried it on my laptop with very similar specs. It ran 40+ fps with medium settings at 900p. Very playable and good for casual gaming.",
  "Play RDR2 instead",
  "you may be able to play the game regarding the high cpu and ram and it may run on a intergrated GPU just try and use low settings (you may not have the best graphics but you'll defo get loads of FPS)",
  "Yes, that's a very well optimized game.\n\nNow, if you want to play AAA games, you might want to get an eGPU, like a rx6600",
  "Yes",
  "Easily, I played GTA 5 on 8gb ram 11gen i5 with 'U' letter at the last (which means it is not ment for games) in 60fps with 1080p low settings your is 13 gen and has H at the last which means it is made for gaming, but since it doesn't have graphic card it can't game good latest games, but GTA 5 is 19yr old and very well optimized game so you will run it easily at 1080p low settings and maybe even high settings, not maxed out but high settings",
  "Yeah, it’ll handle it. Just start with the lowest quality settings and go from there. Also, make sure to set the laptop on a hard surface so that it can breathe well. It’ll get hot. Don’t be one of those animals that game with their laptop sitting on the bed, please.",
  "Integrated graphics, no it won't work well. It will run, probably at 40fps max which isn't great. It'll be 40fps but feel like 20 because of frame times. It's a 2.1ghz cpu that might boost to 3.5ghz if you're lucky. This is a media laptop, it's meant for watching movies and just general Internet browsing. \n\n\nI actually just looked it up on YouTube, you'll be lucky to hit 30fps. It looks like the frame rate drops hard in the middle of the city and any PC gamer can agree that sudden fps drops are very jarring. Everyone saying it will run fine didn't do a simple Google search, it will run, it will not run well. This laptop will barely be able to run Minecraft. Thank you mother, it's a very kind gift, but didn't get your hopes up about any real performance from this machine.",
  "Idk why would you want to play GTA V on that, don't you have a chair? If you insist, you can, but your ass gonna feel uncomfortable.",
  "I run GTA v in the lower options in a laptop whit a core i7 4600u and 8 in DDR3 ram at 30 fps, you surely can",
  "You can, but on low settings, it might be laggy at times but upgrade the RAM.",
  "I think you can even connect it to a external gpu",
  "Should not be an issue.\n\nI had it installed on a 5th gen i5, it ran like complete ass but ran.",
  "No",
  "No it’s a box.",
  "No, you need to buy the game.",
  "You can attempt if you wish but you’ll get like two fps on the lowest settings",
  "I love how humble u are",
  "Bro i can play it on my HP desktop and that only has 8GB of RAM (albeit it isn’t very smooth) but it runs alright. That will be fine.",
  "It might work on this, but you'll probably have to turn some settings down - very decent machine overall it just doesn't have a graphics processor that is dedicated. Give it a shot, I bet you can get it to run, and just go into the settings and turn down shadow quality first, if you have issues with it. keep coming back and we can help you get it going",
  "Its integrated gpu so uses ram as a vram, if you wanna do gaming on it you need to upgrade your ram minimum to 32 but for gta V it should be enough as it is right now",
  "Yeah it's really cool you can play on android too.",
  "The ONLY issue with that is the integrated graphics card, but gta5 is an older game, and integrated graphics cards have been getting better to my understanding.\n\nRegardless of that laptop playing GTA or not, your mom is an awesome lady who got you a laptop and was deeply thinking about you, she did the absolute best she could with the information and knowledge she had. She even went to someone to ask for help which is all a human can do.\n\nGive your mom a big hug and a think you, she loves you very much and you are lucky to have her as a mom.\n\nGoodluck random human!!",
  "Great specs for a laptop it will run it for sure. You can always look up the minimum specs for the game when you’re in doubt btw",
  "It’s a nice laptop W moms",
  "Probably on low video settings. \n\nThe lack of GPU will hurt it, the rest of the specs are decent.",
  "Yes, with low settings it'll reach maybe 50fps?",
  "Yes but I would never buy an IdeaPad",
  "GTA can run on a potato, just don't expect to get the ultra level settings. It will be quite enjoyable once tweaked.",
  "love ur mom bro.",
  "Get something with a descent gpu. Integrated is mostly trouble and will underperform.",
  "Buy a game console make your life easier.",
  "Gya v is pretty old and should run decently on that",
  "I was running Sims 3 on Intel Celeron which was almost as old as the game itself. Yes, it was absolutely impossible on paper. So I would give it a shot",
  "brother you can pretty much play V on mobiles now",
  "On a box, no.",
  "a bit better than a ps3, but worst than a ps4",
  "I wouldn't probably expect much past 20-30fps on low. But you could try. It shouldn't crash",
  "Lenovo 4L",
  "Just please, for the love of all that is good in this world and your sanity, give up now on playing GTAO... It's completely unplayable on PC due to script kiddies and their damned cheat menus. 😮‍💨",
  "You very seriously can play damn near anything on low setting with onboard graphics nowadays. Pretty impressive little things. You won’t be getting crazy FPS on any settings, but you will be able to play it.",
  "Sell it for a cheap gaming laptop",
  "If it gives you issues on lowest settings I recommend  looking into disabling shadows completely, just requires you to edit an xml file, and I remember it taking the game from choppy 19fps to a solid 35-40ish on my old laptop.",
  "Integrated GPU and 16 Gb ram? Probably no. It will struggle a lot because windows will eat a lot of resources.",
  "You can run GTA V on a toaster.",
  "yeah it can run 4k 120 fps 144hz ultra settings ur good to go",
  "Unlikely",
  "Yeeeah.\n\nNot on insane settings but should run just fine.",
  "It's worth trying. My first laptop was a shitty little Toshiba satellite that I got in 2013 with an i3 and 4GB of ram. It ran most older games ok and could run some newer less demanding games. I just had to crank the settings all the way down.",
  "If you have Problems you could try eGPUs for Laptops. With this your Laptop gets a near a Gaming PC at this Specs. Maybe your next Upgrade? With a RTX mounted you could pla the new Indiana Jones Game.",
  "It can definitely run GTA V. But I hope your mom didnt pay alot and you don't expect to play more graphics intensive games in the future cuz it won't run.",
  "I play fortnite at 60fps on a much worse cpu. Its fine. Go message u/DarkTower7899 , he helped me get from unstabel 30fps to 60fps. And also go check out r/Craptopgamingadvice",
  "Yeah. I ran it on a athlon with vega 3 graphics. 1080 low got pretty smooth frames",
  "You can run doom for sure!",
  "No",
  "expect 30 fps at 1080p low,You can max out textures and drop to 720p for 50fps,I know you shouldn't but ask your mum if you can return the laptop for something with a 5500U or 5600U,It will be quite a bit better in gaming and probably cheaper than the i5 as well",
  "Yes it will run, some people here are so disassociated with the real world its insane. More than half of the pc gamers would be happy to run a game on a window at 800x600 just to hit 30 fps, especially if you are tight on money. Your mom is really cool, appreciate the gift and be a great son to her.",
  "Ram is non upgradable so good that you have 16gbs but if you struggle with space you should have second slot as I see at spec page so you would be able to fit in second m2 ssd to have more space if it would be an issue in the future. Having more there 80% of ssd filled can cause system slowing down a bit so its good to have spare space for it the bare minimum is 10gb to keep windows stable.\n\nNot the gaming beast but solid laptop for daily use. GTA is and old game and should run pretty decent to be playable though on this newer intel chips. Newer games will strugle or even not launch but steam has 2hour refund policy so you can install it and refund immediately if it would be hassle for your device to run it.",
  "The only concern I would have is the integrated graphics, but other people say it can run fine!",
  "I see people playing GTA 5 on Dell Optiplex with the Intel 2600, 16gb, only upgrade is SSD memory playing in 1080p working fine",
  "I mainly use my system for editing content and while I do have GTA V on steam does it allow me to use mods. I see a lot of cool add-ons with the modified version. Can anyone guide me to a link for beginners to play with mods?",
  "yeah 60 fps easily go for it just keep the laptop elevated to regulate temps",
  "Not on high settings.  MAYBE on medium settings with NO shadows.",
  "Let me know how it goes once you install GTA on it and if it works or if it doesn't.",
  "Play gta 5 with the cardboard box or the item inside?",
  "Why don't people ever look up the requirements for the game they're looking to run first? I mean specs are listed for the game everywhere.",

  "Your mom is so sweet and you must be an awesome child for her to gift that to you. I think it will run on low settings. If not there are plenty of games on GOG it can run. I'm pretty sure integrated cards can run Starcraft 2 now",

  "nah it won't run smooth or high ress on those integrated graphics.",
  "Considering it only has integrated graphics and only an I5 I highly doubt it will run well on anything above low and even that may be a struggle. But you can test GTA V with steam and refund if you play less that 2h so may be worth a test and come back with the info!",

  "No",
  "Integrated GPU's nowadays are capable of more than you think! They actually are impressive now! To answer your question: yes you can play gta V on it! I think its fair to say the integrated graphics noawadays are comparable to a GT 1030 or maybe even better already, and that card can play light games! So you are fine!\n\nAnother advantage of IGPU: it consumes less battery! So youl have longer to go with it!",

I got really lucky with the gifted GPU, but the whole thing cost me less than fifty dollars; and that aside, the summary total of everything in it is less than $100, looking at second-hand prices on ebay.\n\nThat setup--in which the newest component is more than seven years old--runs GTAV flawlessly with maximum vanilla graphics settings.

This comparison is equivalent to saying that because a game runs on a GTX 1060 it will run on integrated Intel graphics. \n\n\nThis machine has 16gb of RAM, only 4 will be dedicated to the very weak on board GPU. That's not enough vram for GTA 5 and the GPU would bottleneck anyway, even with enough vram. 720p30 is not a pleasant experience which was the point of my initial reply. It WILL work but it will NOT be a good experience. GTA:3-SA will run perfectly, GTA4 would be lucky to hit 20 fps and GTA 5 will barely hit 30 in open areas.

  "Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Gen 6: First impressions I purchased the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G6, model 21NQCTO1WWBR1 on July 2025 and would like to make my impressions about this product:\n\nDESIGN AND BUILD: We don't have much to comment on the design, as it's quite minimalist. We're surprised that not all the keyboard keys follow Lenovo's signature layout, as is typical on IdeaPads, but at least the Ctrl and Fn keys are in their traditional positions, unlike ThinkPads. The light color isn't bad, but it's a shame there wasn't a darker color option (not black, which is typically only seen on ThinkPads, but a darker gray would have been nice). The touchpad is a good size. We found the number of ports interesting, but the Ethernet port's position wasn't particularly helpful, being on the right side. It's interesting that it also has an SD card reader. The number of LEDs also caught our attention, with one next to each USB-C port, in addition to the power button itself (which we really like being separate from the keyboard). We liked the backlit keyboard and the dedicated \"?\", \"/\", \"°\", and \"Menu\" keys, although they sacrificed one of the Ctrl keys. At least it didn't come with the \"Copilot\" shortcut. We didn't really like the notch in the webcam area and found it a rather questionable design decision, but we understand its usefulness. We also liked that it came without those infamous labels on the palm rest, just the Intel seal.\n\nSCREEN: We liked the quality of the IPS, but we were disappointed that the screen had excessive IPS Glow at the bottom edge, quite visible with the screen on a black background even in bright light. My brother was okay with it, but I didn't like this defect at all, which I'm already accepting is quite common in current LCD screens, as I've also seen notebooks and even smartphones and tablets from other brands with this issue. It shouldn't happen, but we've come to understand that IPS Glow is now part of the experience of having an IPS LCD screen, which is unfortunate. At least we like the thin bezels.\n\nSOUND AND WEBCAM: Neither impressed in any aspect, but neither disappointed.\n\nBATTERY AND CHARGING: The USB-C charger is interesting. My brother tested it by playing YouTube videos in 1080p with maximum brightness, and it lasted over 5 hours unplugged. For a 60Wh battery, it's an okay battery, but it could be better.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND USABILITY: Regarding performance, considering its specifications, I consider it okay. It worked very well even for running virtual machines via VirtualBox. We didn't notice excessive heat on the keyboard when heavily loaded. My brother installed the Big Linux distro, and in testing, it has worked well, including mirroring the laptop screen to our Smart TV wirelessly. My brother was unable to get BlissOS, based on Android 13, to work, as it didn't recognize Wi-Fi, but emulating Android on Big Linux with WayDroid has worked well most of the time.\n\n**Have you also purchased a Lenovo ThinkBook? Share your experiences with it in the comments below.**",
  "Looks cool",
  "I got the same laptop, with 8gb of RAM, and im quite satisfied with it. I use it mainly for college stuff, and it can handle an entire day of coding, browsing the internet and even playing some light games (such as Horizon Chase). \n\nBattery life on it is quite impressive on linux. I get 6-8h of usage with it. That's more than i get with Windows (i have no idea why i just get 3-5 hours on Windows), but i've seen some minor compatibility issues on linux, such as the mute key not lighting up or the volume keys getting \"sticky\" (if i hold it a little bit, it goes to max volume or 0), but overall, the laptop is very usable.\n\nI plan to upgrade to 16gb soon, because on my use case, 8gb is too low, especially when i get 16 tabs open for research + some niche software from 10 years and VScode.\n\nOBS: Você é o CAVBR do fórum Adrenaline, não é?",

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Lenovo Thinkbook 14 2 in 1 gen 5 or Yoga 7 gen 10? Currently on the market for a new laptop to replace my 2 in 1 chromebook for uni work and sketching on the go.\n\nBoth of those options seem to be on my budget and seem to be highly regarded.\n\nSo, whilst I'm personally leaning towards the yoga 7 due to better screen, better chip, audio and battery. I'd love to know what everyone else thinks.\n\nThe main advantage I've gotten so far for the thinkbook is slightly better built quality, upgradability (but the yoga I'm looking at already comes with 24gb ram and 1 tb storage) and a built in finger print sensor.",

  "LOCKED BIOS - Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE) I bought a Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE) at an auction. The BIOS/UEFI is locked with a Supervisor Password. A repair shop reflashed both EEPROMs from scratch (64 MB BIOS REGION and 16 MB ME REGION), but the password remained. They concluded the password resides in the MEC1723N EC, which isn’t rewritable with conventional bench tools and also has epoxy underneath, making replacement difficult. I’m trying to contact the original company to have it cleared officially.\n\n**Device**  \nModel: ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (Intel), Type 21HE\n\n**Repair shop’s assessment**\n\n* From their investigation (including reading and analyzing the extracted hex), they did not find any sector in the EEPROMs where the password might be stored.\n* Conclusion from their studies: on some T14 units, the Supervisor Password is stored in the **Embedded Controller (EC)**, specifically the **MEC1723N**.\n\n**Practical issues:**\n\n* The MEC1723N would have internal firmware with no known method for reflashing using standard bench tools;\n* Lenovo uses black resin/epoxy under the chip, making desoldering/replacement almost unfeasible;\n* Even swapping in a “blank” chip would require the proper EC firmware, which the shop does not have.\n\n**Technical confirmation:**\n\n* On a **ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE)** with **MEC1723N**, does the **Supervisor Password** indeed reside in the EC?\n* Has anyone here successfully **reprogrammed or replaced a MEC1723N** (preserving firmware integrity), or can confirm that it cannot be done without Lenovo’s proprietary resources/firmware?\n\n**Legitimate paths:**\n\n* Beyond **system board replacement** and the **official process via the previous owning company**, is there any **authorized route** (e.g., **Lenovo Authorized Service Centers**) that can **reflash/synchronize the EC** to clear the SVP?\n\nThank you.",
  "The MEC1723N does contain the SVP, and reading online from people who have attempted it, it is very much possible to remove the black resin, although with some roughness.\n\nhttps://www.badcaps.net/forum/troubleshooting-hardware-devices-and-electronics-theory/troubleshooting-laptops-tablets-and-mobile-devices/3498772-guide-to-transplant-mec1503-ec-chip-and-eeprom-reprogamming-for-t14s-gen-2-and-x13-gen-2\n\nMy best bet would be replacing the whole chip with a cleanly flashed one, and then after using this guide to change your model name, serial, etc back to original",

AMD processor is power efficient, good processor, Lenovo has a good display and robust build quality.\n\nIntel is not bad compared to the AMD, Intel has 4 extra E-Cores that perform less demanding tasks like Paaint (its a joke), less demanding tasks like opening task manager (another joke, sorry).\n\n**Cores:**\n\n* Intel has 2P+8E = 10P & 12 threads\n* AMD has 6P & 12 threads\n\n**RAM:** Samsung has DDR-5600 RAM & Lenovo has DDR5-4800 RAM\n\n* Samsung doesnt have the RAM upgrade option as far as I know, researched about it.\n* Lenovo has 2 upgradable slots & upto 64GB RAM (imagine 16GB DDR5-5600 vs 64GB DDR4-4800)\n\n**Storage:** Both Samsung & Lenovo offering 2 SSD slots for upgrade upto 4TB (2tb each slot)\n\n**Warranty:**\n\n* No info on the onsite/offsite warranty for Samsung\n* Lenovo has 1 year Onsite Warranty ; no rushing to service and standing in queue to get your device registered\n\n**Favorism:** I am an AMD person.",
  "Laptop Advice- Lenovo ThinkPad X9-15 Aura  vs. the 14″ MacBook Pro M4 ",
  "Which one did you go for?",
  "How good/bad is the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 15 Gen 10? I can get the 15\" IPS model with the Ryzen 5 7535HS and 70 Wh battery for less than 700 euros not choosing to have a OS preinstalled (689 euros instead of 719).\n\nI'm looking for a laptop that got at least a 100 % sRGB color coverage with a good processor and without Numpad, and this Lenovo is what i'm searching.\n\nBut how good/bad is the quality of IdeaPad? Om Reddit i see peoples complains about problems over problems for the previous gens but the reviews for this gen are speaking good.\n\nI will NOT using for work or university but for a more semi-occasional home usage and when i'm travelling for RAW photo editing.",
  "Am not big fan of Lenovo ideapad and i never tried one, I just see one with my friend and it was old and bad, I heard some people talk about the older version of the built quality.\n\nWhat about asus Vivobook S15, i think it come with a 2K, oled display, it will be great for you or buy a used or refurbished MacBook",
  "Also i want to add that i have found also the Yoga Sim 7i Gen 9 with the Core Ultra 155H and 60 Hz OLED display for a extra 50-60 euros.\n\nBut the thing is how bad will be OLED burn-in on this entry level OLED panels?",
  " Hey i just oredered the same model but with an oled panel 165hz for the same price. \n\nI think it should be enough for ur basic needs",
  "The Vivobook is bigger (beacause there is the numpad) and i find it to be way more expensive for the OLED models.\n\nA alternative that i have found is also the Yoga Sim 7i Gen 9 with the Intel 155H and 60 Hz OLED display for 750 euros. \n\nIs the Yoga better than the IdeaPad on a build quality standpoint?",
  "Considering getting this laptop, how’s it holding up? Specifically, how is the build quality? Many thanks",
  "Yoga slim 7i is a perfect option for what you looking for with the price and just watch reviews for it cuz i don't trust the hinges of any 360× laptop",
  "Almost using it daily, Very nice oled screen, lightweight alimunium build. Pretty fast for normal daily tasks. Good keyboard and glass trackpad. Not loud at all. All around im pretty happy with it.",
  "[deleted]",
  "Mine is 54.7wh also it might not be macbook level but im pretty happy with. If i watch movies i think it should atleast last 6 hours without energy saver and max brightness. Its really effecient",
  "Hi man, I’m considering buying this laptop. Can I ask you if you are still satisfied with it? The battery life is still good? Thank you",
  "Yes its overall a pretty good laptop especially for the price, i think you wont be  disappointed.",
  "Can you tell me how long the battery lasts? What is the average hours you get out of a charge? Thank you",
  "HP EliteBook X Flip G1i vs Lenovo ThinkPad T14s 2-in-1 Gen 1 Hi there,\n\nthere is a choice between:  \n**HP** EliteBook X Flip G1i  \n\\- Ultra5 226v   \n\\- 16Gb  \n\\- 512 Gb  \n\\- 14'' (568 cm²), 1920 x 1200, 60 Hz, antiglare, IPS - 400 cd/m2  \n\\- active Pen included  \n\\- 3 years warranty\n\nand   \nLenovo ThinkPad T14s 2in1 G1  \n\\- Ultra5 225u  \n\\- 16Gb  \n\\- 512 Gb  \n\\- 14.0\" (35.6 cm) 1920 x 1200 matt, 400 cd/m2  \n\\- active Pen included  \n\\- 2 years warranty\n\nthe laptop is for a pupil for everyday use, I'd estimate 70% typing / 30% writing.\n\nHP costs $200 more, though it is not black and the pupil likes it a lot.  Otherwise the specs sound about identical.\n\nNeed advice on which one to pick.",
  "Asus Vivobook S16 OLED (S5606CA) or wait for Lenovo ThinkPad T16 Gen 4? Hey folks, I’m torn between getting the **Asus Vivobook S16 OLED (S5606CA)** now or waiting for the **Lenovo ThinkPad T16 Gen 4**.\n\nI’ll mainly use it for work — I run a company (SemioDigital), and I’m a sysadmin with a focus on Linux and cybersecurity. I’ll also do some light content creation on the side.\n\nThe **Vivobook** is tempting: for the price, you get a latest-gen i7, solid performance, light chassis, good battery, and that OLED screen is just gorgeous… but glossy.\n\nOn the other hand, the **ThinkPad** is a business classic — more rugged, easier to service, has a matte display (less pretty but more practical), and overall better for long-term use. The downside is that it’s heavier, the current screen isn’t great (compared to the oled), and I’d have to wait for the Gen 4 to match the Vivobook’s specs — at a higher price.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar dilemma? Thoughts?",
  "Why not the vivo book with the HX370?",
  "I've briefly had vivobook with hx370 - mediatek wifi was basically unusable ( newest firmware, newest kernel on ubuntu). So what i've done is configured a environemnt and that's it - but seemed to work great other than that wifi issue, and some random internet guy have said that havent got the same issue as mine.  \n  \nNow i'm rocking intel core ultra 255h version of that vivobook, and it has some weird performance issues - something like it would be heavily bottlenecked with storage? Or maybe sometimes it let's those ultra efficient cores to work on something? Not sure, \"wait\" in top rises, nothing is happening when it should be launching an app.  \nIt does work slower under linux when it comes to blender. Some blender operations do impact whole system, and it can freeze.\n\nIt is maybe because of some drivers are not ready yet?\n\nGlossy screen in great indoors, somewhat useable outside - especially in shadowed area.\n\nIt gives me about 6hours of battery under linux, while doing some light coding. Not great, but kindof enough for me.  \nIt does throttle heavily while charging(sic!) - something is triggering PROCHOT. So no real work while it's charging :|\n\nI've tested it under ubuntu 25, with linux 6.14.\n\nTomorrow is last day that i can return it, and i think that i will - this experience is not as good as price was high.",
  "I can't find it anywhere",

  "Debating on a refurbished Acer nitro v15 with an rtx 4050 and a 13th gen 17 or a brand new Lenovo loq 15 with an rtx 3050 (both same vram) and an 8 core i5 12th gen I'm kinda sceptical on the Acer on things I've heard but I can get both for the same price. ",
  "Dont go for acer nitro v15 fans are jet poor thermals yuck and hinge will break in just 2 years.",
  "The loq has motherboard issues, the nitro has way better specs",
  "Did you get the Acer? If so how are you getting on with it?",
  "Well crap thanks for bringing that up I'm probably going get the Acer now I looked it up and it's way more common then it should be.. il just have to get a cooling pad for the Acer then..",
  "Nope I actually decided on an Asus tuf a16 with an Rx 7700s instead, much better buy",
