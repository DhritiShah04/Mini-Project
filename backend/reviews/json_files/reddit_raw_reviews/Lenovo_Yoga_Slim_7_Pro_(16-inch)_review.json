  "Getting a new laptop through my work at a discounted price, looking for stylus note taking, modelling, gaming and office use. Help me choose \nI'm able to get one of these laptops through my workplace for a somewhat discounted price with a 3 year warranty. My main use case is going to be writing some notes on the device as a tablet with a stylus, lightish gaming, CAD and video editing. Then some general office and Uni work. So Clair Obscur is a game I want to play, some light modelling in blender maybe or autocad, and editing 1080p footage and possibly short 4k video in Da vinci. Any thoughts? May be able to get others a slightly lower cost than standard but curious to see what people think. Thanks.\n\nMSI Summit E16 AI Studio A1VETG-002, 32GB RAM, 1TB, RTX 4050 – price £792\nSKU # 9S7-159621-002\nMSI Summit E16 AI Studio A1VETG-002UK Intel Core Ultra 7 155H Hybrid (2-in-1) 40.6 cm (16\") Touchscreen Quad HD+ 32 GB LPDDR5-SDRAM 1 TB SSD NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) Windows 11 Pro Black\n \nAsus Proart PX13 32GB RAM, 2TB RTX 4070 – price £1604.40\nModel: HN7306WI\nASUS ProArt PX13 OLED HN7306WI 2-in-1 Laptop | 13.3 Inch 3K OLED Touchscreen | AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 | 32GB RAM | 2TB PCIe SSD | Backlit Keyboard | Windows 11 | Stylus Pen : Amazon.co.uk: Computers & Accessories\n \nLenovo Yoga Slim 7i Gen 9 Aura Edition (15\" Intel) – price £943.20 \nPart Number: 83HMCTO1WW\nLenovo Yoga Slim 7i Gen 9 Aura Edition (15″ Intel) | AI-Fueled Creativity | 83HMCTO1WWGB4 | Lenovo UK\n \nLenovo Thinkpad E14 Gen 7 – price £764.40\nPart Number: 21U2CTO1WW\nThinkPad E14 Gen 7 (14 inch Intel) | Next-Gen AI PC for Business | 21U2CTO1WWGB2 | Lenovo UK \n\nAny particular standout? Very tempted by the Proart but not sure if the £800 extra over the MSI is justified for better specs. The Lenovo are more hoping the IGPU will be enough for me, instead being lighter for portability and better battery. Unfortunately can't find many reviews on the MSI, I know the 4050 isn't great but wondering it it'll do for me. Thanks.",

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "ASUS Zenbook S14 vs. Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura 15 vs. LG gram Pro 16/17 - which would you choose?

  "Thank you for your detailed list and preferences it makes it really easy to compare! Notebookcheck made a comparison of both laptops, and I think they will be really helpful for you. [Asus review.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-VivoBook-14X-OLED-K3405-Laptop-Review-No-frills-multimedia-laptop-with-Core-i5-13500H-and-vibrant-2-8K-OLED-display.726592.0.html) [Lenovo review.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-Slim-7-Pro-X-laptop-review-The-Asus-VivoBook-14-alternative.697031.0.html#nbc_nbcompare_div) \n\nThe Asus' advantages are much better battery life (8 hours vs 5 on Lenovo) and an HDMI port. The Lenovo has a better screen, thermals, fan noise, and build quality. In terms of performance, the Asus has noticeably higher CPU performance than the Ryzen 9 according to the review. Since you are considering the Ryzen 7, this will be an even larger gap. However, Lenovo has noticeably better GPU performance.\n\nI would personally choose the Asus between the two, since battery life and CPU performance is really important, and the GPU is only 10% behind. But the biggest factor would have to be QuickSync, which is some magic Intel hardware acceleration that [beats the Desktop RTX 3090 in some cases of video editing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ovRtmTxjuE) And since you will do video editing, getting Intel will be much better. \n\nSince you say you work on your lap, these laptops get really hot on the bottom (50 for Lenovo and 54 for Asus). This is the case for most laptops with a dGPU. I really don't know the situation in your laptop market, but why don't you consider getting a Lunar Lake laptop? You will get respectable iGPU performance since the 3050 is not that strong anyway. You will also get much better CPU performance, portability, thermals, battery life, and build quality.",
  "Hi, can u share why tho?",
  "Lunar Lake one? I mean the price...",
  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",
  "HP spectre 16t vs Lenovo Yoga slim 7 pro 16 Hello guys, \n\nTrying to choose between two laptops. Both are 16 inch.  There is an option for HP to buy 4k oled, 60hz screen. Lenovo has a 3k 120hz ips screen. Both have rtx 3050 gpu. Which one would you buy? There are just few reviews on youtube for both of the laptops",
  "i generally go for the lower resolution high refresh rate since I dont expect high settings at high resolutions and I play older AAA games on my laptop so I can have a smooth experience \\~100 fps or I can limit it to 50 if I want the laptop to be quiet if im in a room while people are sleeping (military deployed life)",
  "Also the Spectre is 2-in-1/convertible, while the Yoga has a numpad. Might want to check the I/O on both in case there's an important difference for you. IDK what the price difference is but assuming the same price, you should pick based on which features you need the most. If it's mostly for gaming, or if you do a lot of data entry, then the Yoga has an advantage. If you want something for media or portability, then the Spectre.",
  "I am with you. I'm in good shape now lol I was scrolling and scrolling trying to find where exactly it broke and couldn’t figured out a way. Thanks for posting it. I followed that and did fine. Its pretty obvious which one would be happy if someone promoted another religion to them.\n\nThe biggest issue I have about the theory \" I need to go touch some grass and get a trustworthy birth chat?"
