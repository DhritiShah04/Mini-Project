  "Lenovo Yoga 7i Gen10, 14-inch laptop (2025) review **UK-based Laptop Review**\n\n**1. Title:**  \nLenovo Yoga 7i Gen 10 (2025) Review: power and portability\n\n**2. Introduction:**\n\nThis is a review for the 2025 yoga 7i gen 10 model from Lenovo with intel core ultra 7 258v and 14 inch screen. I bought the configuration from the UK Lenovo website with 32GB RAM, 1TB SDD, 2.8k OLED 120Hz screen, Luna Grey colour and optioned the fingerprint scanner for an additional £10, paying £1090 in total (including the 10% VIP discount for healthcare workers). This is a premium grade 2-in-1 consumer laptop with a solid build, great for anyone who needs a portable and powerful device.\n\nI haven’t seen many user reviews for this particular generation of laptop so thought it would be useful for anyone considering it.\n\n**3. Design and Build Quality:**\n\nThe chassis all metal, which gives it a very solid feel. The build quality is great, there’s very little flex in the case or the keyboard. The body does not pick up fingerprints. At 1.4kg, it’s not the lightest laptop but it’s still very portable. It fits my 13 inch laptop sleeve. I don’t have much use for the tablet mode as I find it too cumbersome when compared with holding an actual tablet. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and the trackpad is smooth and accurate. I appreciate the double height enter key. Coming from the LG gram 16, this is a much better typing and trackpad experience.\n\nPort selection is good. There are 2 USB-C ports, one on either side, with one USB-A, one full-sized HDMI, a microSD card slot and a headphone jack. The power key is on the right side which I’ve mis-pressed a couple of times so I’ve disabled it in the settings.\n\nThe display is a 14-inch glossy OLED touchscreen with 2.8K resolution (2880 x 1800), 500 nits brightness (1100 nits HDR Peak). I find the screen bright and vibrant. Watching video in a dimmed room is fantastic with zero light bleed. Reflections and fingerprints can be an issue, especially when viewing dark things on the screen and there is bright ambient. However it is still useable under these conditions.\n\nThe hinges are solid, with little screen wobble when typing but it does require two hands to open the lid. The look and feel of the laptop is very nice with smooth rounded outer edges.\n\n**4. Performance and heat:**\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 258v is perfectly capable of handling my usual tasks of multiple Chrome/ Firefox tabs, connecting to my remote desktop for work and steaming video content.  I have tried some gaming and the experience with casual  games has been very good. Fortnite runs at 120FPS. Cities Skylines runs great. I’ve tried playing Watchdogs and although it could play it, the framerates were only around 40fps and the processor got quite hot with the fans getting noisy.\n\nThe keyboard and palm rest areas are always cool. The area under the screen gets warm under load but the hot air is blown out through the vents on the back, away from the user which is a good design.\n\n**5. Audio and Webcam:**\n\nThe speakers are fine, they are up firing from the sides of the keyboard and they are rated for Dolby Atmos. I can clearly hear the 3D effects when watching YouTube or Netflix. There isn't much bass but it is acceptable for a thin and light laptop.\n\nThe 5M IR camera is decent for video conferencing. There is a privacy shutter switch just above the camera. Windows Hello usually takes just a few seconds to log me in. I have found the fingerprint scanner works faster, especially when the lighting conditions are not ideal for Windows Hello.\n\n**6. Battery Life:**\n\nThe 70WHr battery lasts all day for me when web browsing/ streaming videos. I use a 100W Ugreen 4-port USB C charger to charge all my devices and the laptop fully charges within a couple of hours.  \n\n**7. Software and User Experience:**\n\nThe OS is Windows 11 Home 64 and comes with some minor bloatware including McAffee Antivirus, Lenovo support/ vantage/ AI shenanigans. The Lenovo Vantage software has some useful features including dimming various parts of the screen to save battery – I only use the taskbar dimming though as I find the background dimming too distracting. It also enables you to switch the laptop on just by lifting the lid, which means the much maligned side power switch is hardly ever used. There have been reports of this power button breaking easily on other models and thus bricking the device.\n\n**8. Price and Value:**\n\nThe base model costs £1000 (£900 for students or those that qualify for VIP member) and comes with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and a14inch WUXGA OLED screen (1920x1200, 400nits, 60Hz). I was happy to pay the \\~£200 premium for the better spec’d screen with double the RAM and SSD. Mine came with a 65W USB-C charger and a stylus pen which magnetically attaches to the lid.\n\n**9. Pros and Cons:**\n\n* **Pros:** Screen, performance, battery life, keyboard\n* **Cons:** Screen reflections, power key positioning.\n\n**10. Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a well-built laptop where the pros far out-weigh the cons. The OLED screen is fantastic and it has been a pleasure watching content in a darkened room. It is very easy to travel with, having all-day battery life and a thin and light form factor.\n\n**Final Rating:** 9/10",
  "Really nice post.\n\nIm looking into this as pretty much the only option as the price is really good compared to others.\n\nIm sceptical about the hinges, but you say they are fine. And also if the performance is okay, if i could spec it id go higher but there arent really any options. \n\nThe next thing is vivobook which goes about 50% more with worse screen",
  "How about the weight, does it feel heavy...do you think it's worth the penny and do you think it's a good investment until 2028 atleast?",
  "Im setting up my 16 inch model right now and the fans are running on low constantly and high pitch too, did yours do the same?",
  "Hey, I am curious how did you opt for the fingerprint scanner. I can't find it in the configurations. Thanks.",
  "Potentially stupid question...\n\nI'm comparing different Lenovo Yoga 7s on their website,  and nowhere does it say which generation is which... How do you guys know this information?\n\nThere's so many reviews out there 😵‍💫",
  "I'm thinking of getting this laptop but I'm wondering about the CPU performance for things like python and matlab number crunching(data/optimization/small simulations etc)\n\nJust curious what kind of work do you do on it and is the CPU fast enough for that? I'm still not sure whether the lesser multicore compared to a 200H arrow lake is a problem or if I'm overthinking about the 258V",
  "hello, here some questions:\n1. what version of hdmi port does it have?\n2. What components could you upgrade? ssd, battery, keyboard?",
  "Just a question: does the screen have a plastic border, or is it all glass? ",
  "[removed]",
  "Hi OP, I read a few other reddit posts regarding poor battery life on this particular screen option (2.8K) compared to alot of the youtube reviews (which seems to be based on the 1200 screen option). When you say all day do you mean \\~7 hours? Are you leaving your screen on 120Hz or reducing it to 60Hz.",
  "Hi, I’ve used a Lenovo Yoga 7 AMD from a few generations back with the Ryzen 6800U for the past 3 years and have had no issues with the hinges for what it’s worth!",
  "Thanks. Only time will tell regarding the hinges but they look and feel sturdy to me and these double hinge designs should in theory spread the force out across the 4 contact points on each hinge, reducing the stress at any one point. I'll update if I have any problems with the hinges",
  "It doesn't feel heavy but it's not feather-light like the LG gram. The LG gram can be lifted from a corner with one hand easily whereas I'd struggle to do this with the Yoga 7i. The Yoga 7i   feels more substantial, more premium. However it is still easy to carry around in a back pack.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase so far - it does everything I need and I feel it is good value for what you get compared to an equivalent from HP or Apple. As long as I keep the battery in good condition and the hinges don't break, I'm sure it'll last a good 3-5 years. \n\nIf I didn't play PC games, I would have strongly considered a macbook air 13\".",
  "The 14 inch model doesn't have this problem at all. It's mostly silent. Your 16 inch model should have even better thermal handling given the extra space. The constant fans might be due to all the updates being installed, see how it goes",
  "It came up as an option for me when I selected luna grey as the colour",
  "https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-pro-series/lenovo-yoga-pro-7i-gen-10-aura-edition-14-inch-intel/len101y0058\n\nIt can be confusing. The UK lenovo website states which gen it is,  the i is for Intel, they usually have AMD in brackets for AMD models. X means snapdragon. I think the gen 10s are sometimes called Aura Edition too",
  "1. The HDMI port is a standard sized 1.4b\n\n2. The SSD can be upgraded via the M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe SSD slot but that's about it. The RAM is soldered on the model I got.",
  "There is a black border around the screen but the glass extends over it. The border houses the web cam",
  "I turned off the side power button and activated the open screen to switch on option which works really well. It means I never accidentally mis-press the power button and it should last a lot longer",
  " battery life has been fine for me, I've kept it at 120Hz and only charge up to 80%. Off power, I've been using it for 5 hours now, browsing/ streaming at 50% screen brightness and there's still 45% remaining, so that's just 35% battery use after 5 hours of light usage. I would expect at least 12 hours from a fully charged battery",
  "So pc games work on this one? How is the performance, which games did you try out and does it heat up?",
  "Do you still see that option? Cause I don't see it when I want to configure it",
  "Interesting... Yea the Canadian site doesn't mention generation. We have all those versions though.",
  "yea the cpu and size are all included in the full model name, but aura edition stands for the optimized intel partnerships versions that have slightly better battery life and perfs",
  "Is it possible to replace the keyboard?",
  "Awesome. Thank you ",
  "[removed]",
  "Whats the thought behind charging to 80% - does this extend overall battery life long-term?",
  "Yes, you can play PC games. Fortnite runs at 100-120FPS on the native screen resolution. Cities Skylines plays well.  I wouldn't expect to be able to run the latest AAA 3D intensive games well, but it can run most of them on low settings but I wouldn't recommend it for that as the fan noise gets quite loud if pushed too hard.",
  "Yes, it's still there as an option on the Lenovo UK website for the Lenovo Yoga 7i",
  "You would have to replace the entire assembly including touchpad",
  "I've used the laptop for a few months now and on the rare occasion that I do need to use the side power button (maybe twice so far), it's worked as it should. I think if the usage of the power button is so low, it should easily last the entire life of the laptop",
  "Yes, it's an option in the power management software to prolong battery health. It's standard practice for all lithium batteries",
  "Will the ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2025) Handle My Workload ArcGIS Pro + AutoCAD & Tons of Multitasking? I am looking for a laptop to use as a workstation in case I need to provide my own equipment in the future. I am a Design Engineer working with Aerial & Underground fiber optics in the Telecom field. I mainly use ArcGIS Pro & AutoCAD for drafting & designing routes. While I have one of those programs open, I also must have MS Teams, MS Outlook, MS Excel, Adobe Acrobat, Google Earth Pro, 2 to 3 File Explorer folders, plus a web browser running Katapult + Katapult Photo + Katapult Map + Client Engineering Support Platform + Sharepoint + Smartsheet (around 6-7 tabs depending on Google Earth Pro/Google Maps) all running at the same time. I can get away with Google Maps most of the time. Long story short heavy multi tasking processing is a must.\n\nI do not know much about the difference between AMD & Intel processors but from what I have heard AMD excels at multi tasking & Intel is better at running single tasks. Please correct me if any technical information is wrong. Things have evolved a lot since I last purchased a laptop a decade ago for college.\n\nMy current position supplied me a laptop I am very happy with. Here are the specs:\n\nDell Precision 5690\n\nIntel Core Ultra 7 155H (3.80 GHz)\n\n32 GB RAM Speed 7467 MT/s\n\n1 TB SSD\n\n128 MB Intel Arc Graphics\n\n16 inch touchscreen\n\nI have had bad experiences with the Dell I used throughout high school. After having it serviced 7 or 8 times because of the cheap plastic hinge, I replaced it with an all metal Asus in 2017 when I started college. Here are those specs:\n\nASUS Q504UA\n\nIntel Core i5 7200U (2.5 GHz)\n\n12 GB RAM Speed 2133 MHz\n\n1 TB SSD\n\n128 MB Intel HD Graphics 620\n\n15.6 inch touchscreen 2 in 1\n\nEven though I had bad experiences with Dell in the past, this Precision 5690 is really nice. I like the all metal design for the shell & hinges. My only problems with it is that I have yet to see them go on sale and I hate that it only has USB C ports. The XPS goes on sale from time to time but I do not know if that will give me what I need.\n\nAfter doing research the unanimous answer from coworkers, gamer friends, the internet, & even AI was that the bare minimum I need is 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, an AMD Ryzen 7 or 9 / Intel Core Ultra 7 or 9 / Intel Core i7 or i9 processor, & a dedicated graphics card. Preferably I want something that has an extra RAM slot & an extra M.2 slot so that I can upgrade RAM & storage in the future.\n\nI pulled an all nighter last night going through all of the Best Buy Black Friday deals trying to find THE ONE. I narrowed it down to Lenovo, & Asus. I ended up with three options: Lenovo Yoga 9i Pro, Lenovo Legion Pro 5, & the ASUS ROG Strix G16. All three had 16 inch screens but the Yoga got kicked out because it does not have expandable RAM or storage. That left the Legion Pro & Strix G16. I watched a ton of review & comparison videos, checked rtings, & I think I finally did it. I chose the ASUS ROG Strix G16 based on my personal preferences, AMD over Intel processor, & the nail in the coffin was my childhood friend’s recommendation plus his father’s recommendation. They preferred Asus over Lenovo. His fathet owned a Legion Pro, the best Alienware 16 inch, & recently switched to the Strix G16 & loves it. The only difference between my choice & his is that mine has the RTX 5070 while his has the RTX 570Ti, which in my opinion is not worth the extra 800 dollars which is the current difference with the black friday sale favoring mine.\n\nHere are the specs for the winner:\n\nASUS ROG Strix G16\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9000 9955HX3D (2.5 GHz with boost up to 5.4 GHz)\n\n32 GB DDR5 RAM (5600 MHz)\n\nExtra SO DIMM slot (tool free)\n\n1 TB SSD PCIe 4.0\n\nExtra M.2 slot (PCIe Gen 5 ready)\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 with 8 GB GDDR7\n\n16 inch 2.5K 240 Hz 3 ms Nebula Display\n\nNow here are my questions for you all:\n\n1) Will this do what I need it to do?\n\n2) Do these laptops last or will it brick in a few years?\n\nI plan on babying this laptop if that helps.\n\n3) Is 20% off the best sale I am going to find for a current generation ROG Strix G16?\n\n4) Do I need an external cooling pad or fan? If not needed, would you still recommend one, & if so which one works best with this laptop?\n\nThis is going to be my personal computer that can double as a workstation if I need it. The fact that it is a gaming laptop is a plus for when I finally make the switch from console. I like the fact there are 2 x USB-A 3.2 in addition to the the 2 x UBS-C ports. I do not know if I will ever be a full PC person since I like being able to move around, laptops are my power meets portability. My job tried to give me a computer but I declined as I visit family and a tower is not a realistic option for me to travel with.\n\nI am sure this is probably way too much information & I might be making too big of a deal out of this. This thing will probably do everything I need & more. I just like doing my homework before sinking a grand or more into something. Buying a new car took years & the only reason I finally did it was because squirrels totaled my old one.\n\nThanks for your help guys and gals I really appreciate it!",
  "Honestly, think about if you actually NEED a laptop. With this budget you can build a WAY faster desktop.\n\nPersonally, I'd build an equivalent desktop which would save some cash, sell my current laptop and use that money to buy like a 4050 laptop.\n\nYou'd have a capable workstation at home, and a machine to get you by during the day.\n\nThat's of course if you don't NEED portability at all times. \n\nIf you do, this should be fine. I know a engineer who uses a RTX 2060 laptop for work to this day. And my dad's company (which is for construction), had some similarly powerful workstations a few years ago.\n\n\n\nTldr; This is fine, but if possible get a desktop + a reasonable laptop, for your use-case.",
  "I would say get intel, it had a lot more cores then amd, but in all fairness the laptop should be enough for all of your tasks, 32gb might not be enough so consider upgrading, but i think you should get the laptop",
  "I appreciate your feedback. I actually did think about it. Right now I'm doing well in my position, just was getting worried about the future. I have that ASUS that still works, & a back up Lenovo that was a hand me down to replace the eye sore that was my old Dell. The 2 in 1 ASUS got me through college using AutoCAD, Inventor, ArcGIS, & Solidworks. I don't think I need a new laptop (or desktop), I may have just been giddy at the prospect of getting a deal. I am a sucker for deals & have been known to be impulsive not to miss out on them. The deal is good for 1 more day so I'm going to sleep on it again tonight, but more than likely I may not move forward on it right now. As long as things are going well with work I don't need a personal work station. If I do need it in the future I will have done all this research & it will be an easier ordeal not having to start from scratch. \n\nThank you for your candor!\n\nEdit: I slept on it. I did some more research based on the other person's comment I looked for more comparison videos between the Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 U9 275HX & AMD Ryzen 9 9000 Series 9955HX3D on the ROG Strix G16 (2025). Based on that research I've decided to move forward on my purchase but have switched from the AMD to the Intel processor since the Intel model is newer, has an improved chasis,  & has a lot of newly improved features that support more future proofing and quality of life than the older AMD model. \n\nI am not a desktop kind of guy, portability is more important to me than strictly power & perfomance. I understand PC will outperform & be lower cost when compared to laptops. Also having both isn't a realistic option for me, it would be one or the other. My personal preference or bias is laptop > desktop.",
  "I did more research after posting & it looks like you were right. JarrodsTech compared the Intel & AMD versions. The Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 U9 275HX model came out ahead of the AMD Ryzen 9 9000 Series 9955HX3D in most cases. It also has easier access to the internals with a pull tab instead of 12 plus screws just to remove the bottom panel. The Intel model supports the next generation PCIe 5 for future proofing on both SSD ports whereas the AMD only supports PCIe 5 on 1 of 2. The Intel version includes 3 USB A ports where as the AMD only has 2 USB A ports. They have the same number of USB C ports but the port speeds are faster on the Intel than on the AMD model. The Intel also has WiFi 7 compared to WiFi 6 on the AMD.\n\nThe Intel model looks better with the 360° RGB, & it runs cooler thanks to the updated vapor chamber design. It also uses liquid metal & cools both the CPU & GPU, while the AMD version only cooled the GPU. The Intel also support facial recognition whereas the AMD does not. The Intel was more energy efficient and has a 29% longer battery life when compared to the AMD.\n\nI really appreciate your comment because it pushed me to dig deeper and helped me make a better informed decision. I was close to skipping a laptop upgrade this year, but based on Jarrod’s testing & how this newer Intel model performs and looks, I have changed my mind & am going to stop by BestBuy after work today to go ahead and place my order!\n\nIn case you wanted to see the comparison video I was talking about here is the link to it.

  "I just realized in the checkout that the Intel has the RTX 5060 GPU (the 5070 is available but at a +$400 price hike) vs AMD which has the RTX 5070 GPU. The sale price between these 2 is exactly the same at 1,699. I'm thinking about sticking with the Intel because of the new and improved chasis, both M.2 SSD ports being PCIe Gen 5 compatible, improved cooling, ports, wifi, battery life, energy efficiency, and RGB.",
  "Getting a new laptop through my work at a discounted price, looking for stylus note taking, modelling, gaming and office use.

So Clair Obscur is a game I want to play, some light modelling in blender maybe or autocad, and editing 1080p footage and possibly short 4k video in Da vinci. Any thoughts?

  "swift go 14 sfg14-72-53bp (125H, OLED) UPDATE: 4 months later. i love love love it. it's perfect for me. a 14\" MBP that can do everything that i could ever imagine. no problems thus far. :fingers\\_crossed:\n\n[https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72-53bp](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72-53bp)\n\ni was writing a comment on [Im planning on getting the Acer Swift Go 14 with the oled screen... is this a good idea? : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1dh9jne/im_planning_on_getting_the_acer_swift_go_14_with/) and basically ended up writing a review, so:\n\nI just got the 125H version (mis-posted as 135H) off eBay for $550 \"like new\"/\"open box\". It's incredible, especially when coming from a limiting chromebook and an even more limiting iPad mini, lol! The 125H goes for $850 and the 155H goes for $1000 on the Acer US store.\n\nof note: the older [Acer Swift X 13500H RTX 3050 version](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-x-14-laptop-sfx14-71g-5911) (an older *non-touch* IPS screen) is going for $800 new! That's a significantly better gpu, but likely more power-hungry and perhaps limited by the 65w battery and even 100w charger, but who knows: those AMD ryzens seem to do way better than the intels of their time. Highly likely to find one going for a low price compared to bigger names. The next jump is at $1300 for a new swift go 14\" 155H rtx 4050.\n\nhere's a quick useful video review about it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3I3q48674&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3I3q48674&t=180s)\n\nmajor notes:\n\n* **the version with the OLED screen does not have touch input.** I found this out the hard way. :( I guess i assumed that the swift's \"go\" series was like \"flipbook\" and \"spin\", in that the touch-screen is it's main feature, without the flipping/spinning part. I was wrong. (the 155H version has touch-screen: [SFG14-72T-71QF](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72t-71qf) along with a 16\" version. Look for the icon with a finger pointing.)\n\nmajor cons:\n\n* the battery life is lower compared to other ultrabooks, maybe 6-10 hours vs 10-14 hours zenbook, perhaps due to the 65w vs 75w battery(?). I can't say yet, and maybe windows (and it's bloatware) is still doing something, but i got 10 hours on my first three charges, draining at \\~10%/hour; But i also always use minimum brightness, and just had the normal 30 tabs open (edge, most tabs sleeping) with music playing. Conversely, perhaps because it has a smaller battery, it charges very very quickly: an hour or so (with the given charger). It's also nice that usb-c was standardized for charging, though i wished the usb-c cable would detach from the power block... A minor gripe. After the first few drains, i've kept the laptop charged, and used some pre-installed Acer program to limit charging when plugged-in (to 80%, no choice). This really is it's only major con.\n* the OLED is glossy. so glossy you can see a deep, deep, and rich reflection of yourself. It's like looking into a dark mass of water. It raises self-awareness and horror :cold\\_face:\n\nproblems likely similar to other ultrabooks, and other notes:\n\n* fan noise, and heat. when it speeds up, it's clearly audible in a quiet bedroom when it starts up. it can start with very little computering ([the zenbook got panned in a review for being worse](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Zenbook-14-OLED-review-The-1-2-kg-subnotebook-with-120-Hz-OLED-and-Core-Ultra-7.805236.0.html)), then it goes back to silent mode, and thankfully, *stays* silent. And when it's silent, it's *absolutely* silent! It's apparently not louder than it's competitors tho?? sounds fine to me... *Thank goodness!* Along with fan noise, it can get a little warm at the palms. I think this happened during the beginning of it charging. Thankfully, the aluminum(?) case ensures it cools down quickly, and keeps it cool. (this is my portable-desktop-laptop, wherein i plan to use a separate mechanical keyboard most of the time anyway). However, when it's not charging, it seems to stay quiet 'n cool, which is the most important time.\n* the speakers are bass-less, but the amp is surprisingly incredible(!!).. but then again, i've never heard good laptop speakers in my life. Zero bass, which i'm okay with, as i'm a dreamy-pop treble music person, but just say no to lo-fi/city-pop. It's interesting to hear bass guitars without the bass.. It reminds me of my old purple 'n gold ATH-AD700 headphones that i adore, but far worse mixing. The audio goes through some artificial spatial surround sound software: the mids seem to live recessed in the bottom center of the laptop (vocals), then are overtly forwarded to every direction / speaker in the artificial speaker system (piano), the highs are all over the place, moving from one part of the laptop to another; and the lows remind me of bad midi music. Your favorite music will *not* move you. You will however listen to your favorite music in a very different way.. Having said that, the speakers can get very loud, easily able to fill up a room(!!), and most importantly: beyerdynamic 300r 32ohm headphones sound great at a mere 10% volume!\n* the up and down arrow keys share a single key area. I use wasd for gaming, so it doesn't bother me. This also keeps the keyboard's shape to a neat rectangle.\n* the left modifier keys aren't big. they're the same size as the letter 'n number keys. The right modifier keys, however, are slightly wider. They had to do this to make space for the function key. UPDATE: i re-mapped/swapped left-control with left-alt, mac-style. much better. i'll likely re-map holding caps-lock to left-control too.\n* the keys feel only slightly better than my $40 samsung chromebook 4, which, now that i'm looking at it, surprisingly, has the big fat left modifier keys and complete arrow keys too! Not bad, that thing! (for programmers the tilde key and delete keys are nice to have, and nicely placed, as are the half-size function/special keys... tho, i'm scared of what bloatware the acer key will manifest..!) UPDATE: in retrospect, it's actually a great keyboard. I ordered a keychron k6, and those red keys are god awful. Seriously, who want's to press a key down for a one-half inch?? I've become used to the tiny distance of laptop keyboards..\n* the 14\" screen is a huge surprise coming from an 11.6\" chromebook (2.4\" is a lot!) and even the 13.3\" macbook, yet it's dimensions are only very slightly larger (<1\"). There's about an inch of empty space on both sides of the keyboard--I'm the sort of person who saw the 15\" Macbook and thought, *\"ugh, what is all that space for!?\"*, and didn't buy one until the 13\" came out. The massive OLED screen gets as close as you'd want to the edges--any closer, your fingerprints would smudge the beautiful screen when opening/closing it. As does the massive trackpad.\n* the bigger touchpad may cause more accidents. I haven't had enough experience, but thus far, it seems fine for my hands, for the most part. I did have had it click on random parts of this review i'm writing quite a few times.. but then again, i'm currently sitting at a bad angle. UPDATE: i love it. bigger is better. i must have gotten used to it, as i don't accidentally touch it anymore..\n* the ports are perfect for me, as i'm not updated on current technology: two thunderbolt(?, new to me), two usb--one on each side!!!, one hmdi, a headphone jack, an sd card reader, and a good ol' kensington lock, lol. I've never used a lock before, but have always found it intriguing . I feel the port choices are very old-school, like me. :) It might be possible for 4 displays for this chip...!? (note: smaller 13.3\" laptops can compromise on ports)\n* bloatware. after 20 years, this still exists. Why? McAfee still exists..?? I did however use the 1 year of 100GB dropbox. Could someone please ship me a usb flash drive or sd card so that i can re-install windows? ;(\n\nwith all the similar \"ultrabooks\" (Asus zenbook, Lenovo yoga, HP spectre, Dell xps 14, maybe even the lower-end Acer spin, Asus flipbook, Asus vivobook, HP pavilion plus, Dell inspiron plus, 'n so on), i felt it's pretty hard to decide on one, and just went with what good deals i found on eBay, and checked the review on notebookcheck, and double-checked that the specs are indeed \"ultra\" (weight, size, build quality--not plastic).\n\nit's direct local (to Taiwan) competition is the asus zenbook, and i actually think that's a better notebook. Better speakers, better keyboard (i prefer big keys over the macbook chiclet-style), betters looks (premium business ultrabook vs macbook clone), lighter (an insane 1.3kg), and most importantly a better battery (75w vs 65w, 12+ hours vs 8 in tests!), but, notebookcheck's review noted a fan noise problem, due to it having a single fan / heat-sink vs this Acer's double fan 'n heat-sink. The problem could just be a fluke, but def worth researching other users experiences about it. Beyond that single problem though, i def prefer the zenbook. However, if a macbook clone is what you're really into, this Acer is just that!: a 14\" Macbook Pro (possibly for half the price due to bad resale value)\n\ni personally chose the Intel ultra series for it's great games/power balance, and x64 architecture. I missed out on the entire AMD marathon. An older asus rog flow x13 (g14 doesn't have touch-screen), razer blade 14, or microsoft surface pro (intel ultra series, not the newer ARM arch models) would have been my top choices, if i were to accept something more used. The previous gen surfaces were way too expensive! But i'm super stoked with what i got for $550. Wow! Also, i love Taiwan (made in Taiwan <3), so Acer 'n Asus were actually my top choices (they do all the hard work of making everything, and are absolutely lovely people with an incredible culture to behold, so let them have all my monies!). Actually, i've been fond of the swift series laptops, particularly swift 3 series and 5 series, ever since that time i went to a physical store to test 'n compare laptops. They were by far the best deals in the \"budget\" range. They were all ultrabooks in my eyes, for a fraction of the price of one.\n\nthe OLED is stunning. Now there's absolutely no need for a Macbook for me. My last one was a late-201313\" MBP. Hello again, Windows. How i've missed you dearly. And oh my, how you've accepted Linux..?? I don't even need Linux anymore, and that's coming from Arch! Also, having done some programming, i can't justify the sufferings that Apple has made programmers go through over its reign. Microsoft has since made a big turn towards accepting open-source, linux, programmers, etc. Strange, but good... i hope.\n\nfor my personal needs, the lower-resolution IPS touch-screen would've been ideal, for both touch input and possibly better gaming performance (*does native resolution matter nowadays..?*). It is indeed a major bummer. However, i feel that without the the ability to swivel the screen around (\"convertible\"), it would've made an odd touch-screen experience anyway, quite different from tablets. Also very important to note, **there's quite a few touch-screen OLED notebooks--**[**including the zenbook**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/13wdvxm/oled_touchscreen_is_awful/)**--, that suffer from a grainy screen problem**--though, i don't know which exact models / year have this problem. So, in the end, i feel it was more of a blessing. Anyway, i'm hoping my next job will pay for a premium laptop. At the moment, if money were not a factor, i'd go for either the Asus rog flow x13 or dreamy z13. The z13 is all i've ever dreamed for, ever since the iPad came out. ;) ...but i've read that even the z13 suffers from a very low battery life. :/\n\nUPDATE: now that i've got OLED, i can't imagine ever going back.. o.o\n\nso, if i were to choose again, a \"new\" 2022 asus rog flow x13 ryzen 7940HS would have been my choice, and very very surprisingly, it's going for a mere \\~$800!! So, unless you find a deal like mine, you should just go for one of the best out there! Otherwise, this is an incredibly solid laptop for its price. It has also easily convinced me macbooks aren't worth it anymore, as it was a decade ago, even considering the newer ARM M-series. I'm a believer of Acer/Asus/Taiwan!",
  "Is the fan noise not that big of a deal? I plan to buy this same model, and will be using this inside my university's computer laboratory. And I don't want to distract others with the fan noise.",
  "I bought my Acer Swift Go 14 on September 28, featuring an Ultra 5 125H processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and a 90Hz OLED HDR display running Windows 11 (23H2). I got it for 60,000 INR after discounts, down from around 80K. My previous laptop was the ASUS FX504, which I used for 6 years.\n\n# Negatives:\n\n* Wi-Fi Speeds & Performance: The ASUS consistently outperforms the Acer in download speeds, and I occasionally feel a static sensation when touching the metal surface while charging.\n* Sharp Trackpad Edge & Heat During Charging: The trackpad edge is uncomfortable, and the right side gets hot while charging, making it tough to use on my lap.\n* Useless Copilot Key & Keyboard Backlight: I remapped the Copilot key to Ctrl using AutoHotKey, but the keyboard backlight turns off too quickly, which is frustrating.\n* AI Features & Webcam: The AI eye contact feature is poorly executed, and the wide-angle webcam captures too much of my surroundings.\n* Glossy Display: It's highly reflective, which isn't ideal for bright environments.\n\n# Positives:\n\n* Stunning Design & Trackpad: The laptop looks sleek, almost like a MacBook, and the massive trackpad is so good that I hardly use a mouse.\n* Solid Hinge & Great Keyboard: The hinge is easy to open with one hand and feels premium, while the keyboard is clicky and visually appealing.\n* Outstanding Display: It's bright and colorful, with excellent HDR for movies.\n* Useful AI Features & Decent Speakers: The AI background blurring and noise cancellation work well, and the speakers are good for a laptop.\n* Convenient Charging & Good I/O: I can use my phone's USB-C charger, and there are multiple USB ports and useful features.\n\n# Performance:\n\nWhile I haven't tested it with games or benchmarks yet, the Acer is significantly faster than my ASUS for everyday tasks. It handles multiple apps smoothly, even on battery.\n\n# Battery Life:\n\nYou can't expect stellar battery life with a high-resolution H-series processor. I got around 5 hours of SOT with regular use and 4 hours while looping a 4K movie. There are ways to extend battery life, but I prefer using it to its full potential since it stays on my desk most of the time.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nFor the price I paid, I believe I found the best laptop for my needs. I'm very satisfied overall. **For the full review, check out my post** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcerOfficial/comments/1g75rhv/new_acer_swift_go_14_ai_pcs_review/).

  "I can hear fan noise for a few seconds each time I turn on the Acer Swift Go laptop that I purchased from Costco.  However, it's generally very silent when watching youtube videos, browsing the web, and doing office work.  Can the fan noise be permanently controlled via BIOS (if I wanted to install Linux on the system) or is one forced to use the AcerSense app?  Frankly though, I've been spoiled by the Thinkpad laptops (X230, T450, and T460s) which are really silent.

  "I bought this exact laptop (yoga pro 7, Intel ultra 7, rtx 4050, 32gb Ram, 1tb) for Christmas. I’ve been searching for the perfect lightweight, slim laptop that’s ideal for schoolwork and gaming.

And most of all it will have insane, best-in-class battery life.\n\njust do a little research to see if there’s something wrong with the model, otherwise, get it!\n\nThe only reason to go for a windows laptop is for a proper gaming laptop, because Apple doesn’t care about games: gamers nor game developers (nor software developers for that matter). Oh also, if you actually need to use windows, i’m not sure if windows even runs on ARM..?? (see link). And what about all those games/apps made for x64 or even older 32-bit? You’d have to research into Mac’s emulation. I would hope the x64 emulation is good, as it takes time to transition cpu architectures.. I personally just wouldn’t want to bother with all of this, so it better be dang good! The intel Macs was a good time imo, having Mac and windows run natively via boot camp. ARM, i have no idea. I haven’t bought a computer in a decade! lol. But that’s the reason I didn’t even bother with the surface pro with ARM (Snapdragon). The whole thing reminds me of proprietary charging cables. It’s not, but that’s how it feels.\n\nBut do note, I have two very strong biases: as a childhood gamer turned game maker, and having at one time the horrific experience of using objective-c and Xcode to make a game for iPad, I value being able to play games (and apps) and not adding more complexity to making games (and apps). Forcing people to buy a Mac product just to deploy to it is insane to me (though surely there’s a service for that now..). Adding restrictions such as which programming language you can use (no JIT, meanwhile Android runs on JVM..). I’ll take the messes that are windows and android/linux any-day.

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Laptop buy help Hi im about to buy a new laptop this weekend, haven't been able to check on physical stores if they have them or not so i just did initial research using their website. I'm currently under IT program, I play valorant from time to time, I also use After effects and Adobe Illustrator for some projects (no heavy 3d work). So far I've researched reviews on these laptops  \n\n\n|Model|CPU|GPU|RAM|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Thinkpad T14 Gen 6 14 Inch| AMD Ryzen™ AI Pro 5 340  |AMD Radeon™ 840M|16 GB DDR5|\n|Yoga Pro 7 (14'', Gen 9)|AMD Ryzen™ 7 8845HS|AMD Radeon™ 780M |16 GB|\n|ThinkPad X1 Carbon G12 [](https://www.lenovo.com/ph/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx1/thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-12-14-inch-intel/21kc0070ph#reviews)|Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 155H Processor|Intel® Arc™ Graphics|16 GB|\n|DELL XPS 14 |Intel  Core™ Ultra 7 155H or 165H |RTX™ 4050, 6 GB |16GB LPDDR5x |\n|Dell 14 Premium Laptop |Intel^(®) Core™ Ultra 7 255H or 265H|Intel^(®) Arc^(™) 140T Graphics or RTX 4050|16 GB|\n|ASUS Vivobook Pro 14|R9-5900HX|RTX 3050|16GB DDR4|\n\n  \nI'm eyeing on thinkpads however they're quiet expensive, so my second choice would be the yoga however I've been seeing comments on how bad the hinges are, and I'm quite worried about it since I really want this on the long run as much as possible I don't want any issues or replacements much. I've had this Dell Inspiron 5570 for about 6-7 years, I've had replacements with it such as the HDD to SSD then ram upgrade, it's been great with me on the long run however the battery is broken. With my experience with Dell, I'm considering to get the Dell XPS or Premium or whatever is good with them right now but they're not really a hot topic now so i can't get much info on the current dell laptops. \n\nAnyways please do recommend on which are really worth getting",
  "*Dell Premium* is supposed to be a successor lineup to the *Dell XPS* family as Dell does not produce new XPS models anymore. That's why the Dell Premium you see there has the Series 2 ultra chip, whereas the XPS has the Series 1 since that was the latest chip they came with. Between those two I would just choose the *Premium* as the Series 2 chips from Intel are a significant improvement over the Series 1 in every circumstance.\n\nIf you really value performance within Adobe After Effects, I would suggest choosing a laptop with a GPU such as the 4050. Integrated graphics are fine for *lightweight* effects work, assuming you go with at least the 780M or Intel Arc, but it's highly recommended to get even a low-power card, such as the 4050, to assist with graphics acceleration.\n\n**The Vivobook is the worst option you listed. I wouldn't buy it.** Great processor for its time, but it is outclassed by processors of this generation. The RTX 3050 was never even a decent GPU, but it doesn't consume a lot of power which is why it's favorable for graphics acceleration within laptops. Still, a 4050 mobile GPU is better.\n\nI would choose between the Thinkpad T14 and the Dell Premium 14 with an RTX 4050. The Thinkpad is built to last, but the Dell Premium gets you better hardware for the price. **The memory in the Thinkpad is upgradable**, while the Dell is soldered LPDDR5X. Take your pick.",
  "need laptop that'll last me for all of college + more possibly! hi everyone! my dad is offering to buy me a new laptop (budget \\~$860 before taxes), and although i'd like to consider myself a computer nerd, everywhere I go I see mixed reviews on every laptop possible. I'm looking for a laptop with a solid battery life that'll last me for about 9+ hours on battery (although I'll be keeping it plugged in at the dorm), 16gb+ ram, 512gb+ storage, and good cpu/graphics for multitasking and light gaming (Roblox, light steam games, video editing, photoshop, Minecraft etc..).

  "How has it been? Im looking at this exact model",
  "I actually just bought this computer for Uni😭really hope its good ill comeback once i receive it this Friday",
  "Ok Thanks. But I think the screen on this one is upgradable to OLED. Also if it's a sub par screen in what ways are they bad as in like would they break easily or?? And I'll check out the last Gen 7i",
  "Just bought this model (Lenovo Yoga 7 2-in-1) when I went in dead set on getting a MacBook. I felt like this was more bang for my buck, they also include Xbox gaming on here, which I am a gamergirl so that's a plus.  Although, upon initial start-up it's seeming like this laptop is kinda slow/buffering? IDK maybe wrong choice of words but definitely have experienced some lagging to where I was like WTF? this is a brand new damn laptop.  I also live outside of the local city, my WIFI is bootycon meaning ABSOLUTE TRASHHHHHH so I am just hoping it's because of that.  I bought this laptop instead of the Macbook for 2 main reasons, the 1TB for roughly $700 & I was spoiled to the touch screen concept. (my other/previous laptop is a lenovo 2-in-1 ideapad? thinkpad? IDK but its a small laptop with google chrome), I needed the upgrade bc my exams are required to be proctored online and google chrome blocks the Guardian browser, which is what they use to proctor), Overall I'm hoping I don't regret this buy.  Any one know how long I have to be able to return for a full refund at bestbuy? \n\n\n\nAlso, if you come across any great pros about this laptop I'm here for it, this thing is apparently capable of alot so I want to reap all of it's benefits.",
  "Lmaoo I found a guy who bought it and was really positive about it...I'll also be buying it once I am back from vacation but lemme know when you get it",
  "Hey man, How is the experience with this PC? any heating / battery issues?",
  "updates?",
  "hey can I get a quick review on it ? performance overall, heating and BATTERY LIFE. How is it?",
  "Screen quality, I ordered one, still havent picked it up, but have heard about it not being very color accurate or bright",
  "hello!! Thinking of buying it, what do u think of it now? I personally also need it for school :) Thanks in advance!",
  "Hmm hopefully its just your wifi, ive read it comes with a lot of bloatware sp maybe that? It does seem the best bang for buck especially for a 2 in 1.",
  "Ciao, anch’io volevo comprare questo modello quindi volevo sapere se ti ha dato problemi fino ad ora. Per il gaming com’è? Poi riguardo al riscaldamento e consumo batteria durante il gaming?",
  "Phew okay what a relief that its a good laptop, it was recommended to me by a best buy employee and yk how they be so i HOPED they where being honest, since I was initially going to get the Microsoft Surface 5. yea ill let yk fs🔥💪🏻",
  "Heyy im back i didnt get the ryzen one but i got the intel one, its a solid computer it can handle games, school work, its not heavy or light its okayy, pretty good for school. I didnt find myself using the folding too much other than for movies. Got any questions? I can prob answer them!!",
  "Yea that's what I also saw somewhere...which screen did you get oled or ips?",
  "[removed]",
  "Hellooo did you buy it?",
  "Yea lol it has amazing specs imo I just wanted some reviews and from that one person it seems to be doing well",
  "hows the battery backup? and heating  \n and do the fans get loud?",
  "how long have you had it for? is there any issues?",
  "Ips, got a really good deal for the specs but idk, might cancel and get a Dell XPS (2022) or M1 Mac air (8gb version)",
  "I personally don't mind the color accuracy, I personally don't edit photos or videos, it's just my work laptop, hell I don't even watch YouTube on it. \n\nSo what are my notes:\nGlass: fingerprint magnet, reflective, makes colors more vibrant\nScreen: too dim for outdoor use, perfect for class/work conditions but not great outside",
  "Looking at this same machine. How did it turn out?",
  "The battery is pretty good depends on what you have it doing obviously but if you are doing homework most of the time you‘ll be good. The fans dont get loud. There is different performance settings when I play games i usually set it high and its not really loud but you could hear it. Its good tbh. Keyboard is fine, screen is good, good computer for a uni student although i recommend you get a mouse just cuz, the pad isn’t bad i just Dont really like pads a lot.",
  "Ive had it for about 7 months",
  "I was thinking about macbook but it's not my thing so imma check out the dell xps as well",
  "[removed]",
  "Love it bro got it like a couple days ago and I am very satisfied",
  "[removed]",
  "Yea it's not mine either but price to performance wise it's a smart buy",
  "Yea fs",
  "[deleted]",
  "Thanks for the response!",
  "Yea it works well i suggest you to buy a type of stylus pen obviously, but yea its works good. Theres prob settings to make it better that I dont know of. But i dont really use it a lot.",
  "[removed]",
  "Hello! Can I ask if you bought it? Im also debating whether I should buy it rn. But a lot of people have been complaining about the battery aswell which I assume you've already seen considering that you're asking about it too lol and how it breaks in just a year or two :') , and how about games too?",
  "They seem fine. Idk about 5-10 years of use but they seem sturdy for now",
  "Best Choice? Hello,\n\nI'm in the market for a new computer as I just started grad school ( business, so mostly web browsing and excel) and my [current laptop](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-flip-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-1tb-hard-drive-black/2995123.p?skuId=2995123) is from 2015 when I started undergrad.\n\n\nI narrowed my search to these 3:\n\n[Lenovo Ideapad 5](https://www.costco.com/Lenovo-Ideapad-5-14%22-2-in-1-Touchscreen-Laptop---AMD-Ryzen-7-8840HS---WUXGA-(1920-x-1200)---Windows-11.product.1816898.html?sh=true&nf=true)\n\n[Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5i](https://www.costco.com/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Slim-5i-16%22-Touchscreen-Laptop---Intel-Core-7-Processor-150U---WUXGA---1920-x-1200-Display---Windows-11.product.1816969.html?sh=true&nf=true)\n\n[Lenovo Yoga 7i](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-2-in-1-series/lenovo-yoga-7i-2-in-1-gen-9-14-inch-intel/83dj0003us)\n\nAny significant differences between Ideapad, Ideapad Slim, and Yoga?\n\nAny significant differences between AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS, Intel Core 7 150U, and Intel Core Ultra 5 125U?\n\nThank you in advance",
  "First one, the amd two in one is def a good deal especially if you like the two in one feature.",
  "First fosho, that’s a great price and I *love* having a 2 in 1. If you are a student, see if you can get a discount to bring that down even more and that will be a godly deal",
  "In this case choose AMD Ryzen 8000 Series over Intel Meteor Lake U Series. Similar battery efficiency but the AMD has better integrated graphics.",
  "First one, no contest",
  "Lenovo IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 WUXGA IPS AMD Ryzen 7 Octa Core 8845HS - (16 GB/ 512 GB SSD/Windows 11 Home) 14AHP9 2 in 1 Laptop (14 inch, Luna Grey, 1.6 kg, With MS Office) is way better with better GPU",
  "1",
  "Pure garbage. Don't buy this thing, many reported hinge problems including mine. Few months after the 2-year warranty expired, my left plastic hinge cover cracked and crushes the display glass. Thankfully the LCD still works fine, touchscreen is dead 1/3 of the display. \n\nTried to complaint to Lenovo service center and whaddya know, 2 people also had the same problem (they still got their warranty). Unfortunately they couldn't do anything.\n\nThe screen is also dim and muted in colors. The addition of touchscreen is nice, but not as nice when it broke. Do yourself a favor and get a Thinkpad or Ideapad 5 Pro if you're going Lenovo as they are much more robust.",
  "I have the second one, the Slim 5i and I would not recommend it for $700 in 2025 for three reasons.\n\nIt is slim but takes up a lot of surface area with the taller 16:10 screen ratio. Not something you want to carry around. \n\nThe big screen would be great but it isn't color accurate or bright. Has a 45% NTSC rating where everything including YouTube feels washed out with a layer of white colors. Basically the same screen they were using in 2021, and likely just threw it on here because they have a lot of old stock.\n\nThe internals feels underpowered and lacks quality. Trackpad makes a flimsy clicky noise, keyboard isn't as polished with key travel, speakers sound tinny with no bass, webcam feels like a phone camera from 2015, it doesn't have 40 GBps thunderbolt 4 instead just basic 5GBps USB c ports. The Core 7 is a rebranded 2023 processor, not to be confused with the new Core ULTRA 7 processor from 2024.\n\nIf you haven't already you can go to a Costco and see these on display and play around with them. I doubt this lasts anywhere near 10 years like your old laptop, maybe just 3.",
  "duly seconded. the processor is a beast, the laptop itself is a good size, and it's too good of a value",
  "the second one is a bad deal considering the processor......its no way near close to the 8840hs performance...also the IGPU is very good",
  "you're right!",

  "Thank you for your detailed list and preferences it makes it really easy to compare! Notebookcheck made a comparison of both laptops, and I think they will be really helpful for you. [Asus review.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-VivoBook-14X-OLED-K3405-Laptop-Review-No-frills-multimedia-laptop-with-Core-i5-13500H-and-vibrant-2-8K-OLED-display.726592.0.html) [Lenovo review.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-Slim-7-Pro-X-laptop-review-The-Asus-VivoBook-14-alternative.697031.0.html#nbc_nbcompare_div) \n\nThe Asus' advantages are much better battery life (8 hours vs 5 on Lenovo) and an HDMI port. The Lenovo has a better screen, thermals, fan noise, and build quality. In terms of performance, the Asus has noticeably higher CPU performance than the Ryzen 9 according to the review. Since you are considering the Ryzen 7, this will be an even larger gap. However, Lenovo has noticeably better GPU performance.\n\nI would personally choose the Asus between the two, since battery life and CPU performance is really important, and the GPU is only 10% behind. But the biggest factor would have to be QuickSync, which is some magic Intel hardware acceleration that [beats the Desktop RTX 3090 in some cases of video editing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ovRtmTxjuE) And since you will do video editing, getting Intel will be much better. \n\nSince you say you work on your lap, these laptops get really hot on the bottom (50 for Lenovo and 54 for Asus). This is the case for most laptops with a dGPU. I really don't know the situation in your laptop market, but why don't you consider getting a Lunar Lake laptop? You will get respectable iGPU performance since the 3050 is not that strong anyway. You will also get much better CPU performance, portability, thermals, battery life, and build quality.",
  "Hi, can u share why tho?",
  "Lunar Lake one? I mean the price...",
  "Need help Why am I feeling buyers remorse from returning my laptop I just got from Best Buy the Lenovo yoga 7 with Ryzen 7 8840hs and rx7780 whatever the Radeon innegrated graphics are and getting a dell Inspiron 2 in 1 with 2560 x 1600 display touch screen 90hz integrated graphics no dedicated GPU and 16:10 display with core ultra 7 155h cou and Intel arc innegrated graphics. The only upgrade I got was a better screen and 90hz refresh rate gs 60 which 60hz was awful to look at and 32Gb of ram but if I ever wanted to I couldn’t upgrade the ram over time like I can on the HP omen 16.1 inch if I went with that. The HP omen has a worse screen on it and is 16:9 vs 16:10 on the Dell Inspiron and only 1920 x 1080, but has 165hz refresh rate and a etc 4060 with 16gb ram which can be upgraded to 64gb ram if I ever needed it down the line for cybersecurity and has a Intel core i7 13620H which but only has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 IPs 165hz. I just feel like the dell Inspiron laptop I gun runs more laggy and slow than my old Lenovo yoga 7 and the Lenovo yoga 7 feels more premium and better built and looks better than the dell and the speakers sounded way better on it same with the keyboard but the display was crap on it Lenovo just put all the budget into the built quality keyboard and CPU that’s about it cuz the display was only 60hz and it was advertised for creator, but the display is only sRGB 45% colors are so washed out on it and looks very plain and dull and the dell feels more cheap and plastic and less durable and I just keep asking myself why did and why would I ever spend $500 more on a laptop to not have a GPU and be able to upgrade to 64gb ram down the line if I ever needed cuz right now I’m stuck with just 32Gb ram which is soldered onto this laptop and can’t be upgraded. \n\nDo I return the dell Inspiron and get the HP omen for a worse display and better performance or keep the dell Inspiron cuz on the dell induction it has a touchscreen and is a 2 in one comes with a pen and I can use it to do math on it n stuff if I wanted to for school next semester. I just keep wondering why I would spend $500 more on a laptop to not get any gains in performance and just looks and display. What do I do here cuz if I really wanted to or needed to I could just return the dell Inspiron and get the HP Omen or any others around that price with the same specs. The main issue I have is I prioritized looks over performance here and it’s just for what I need this laptop for I’m running multiple VMs at a single time and I literally only had 2 VMs opened windows 10 and windows 11 vm with web browser opened and 3 taps opened one of which was my assignment submission page and I was ready at 18gb used and when I opened up kali Linux cuz I sometimes need all 3 VMs opened together it was reaching 20gb used but the crazy thing is when no VMs are being used and I just have web browser opened it’s a whooping 15gb ram is being used at once with only 8 tabs opened and nothing else is running. I even checked the arrow on the bottom right and checked task manager and disabled everything I could on both host windows 11 and VM windows 10 and windows 11 and still so much ram is being used and I can’t get a single YouTube video to run or web page to load and this shit is so much slower than my desktop computer which has a Intel Core i9 14900k with 64gb cl30 6000 ram and RX6950xt soon to be rtx 5080. But I could just be too spoiled form such a fast machine that it makes this laptop feel so slow cuz I’m used to everyone loading up instantly and no lag. But I feel like all this is making me need more than 32Gb ram.  \n\n\nThis is the link for the laptop I originally first got: https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-yoga-7-2-in-1-14-2k-touchscreen-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-8840hs-with-16gb-memory-1-tb-ssd-artic-grey/6571366.p?skuId=6571366\n\n\nThis is what I swapped the Lenovo yoga 7 for: https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-inspiron-2-in-1-16-ips-led-fhd-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-7-with-16gb-memory-1tb-ssd-ice-blue/6575151.p?skuId=6575151\n\n\nThis is the HP omen that was around the same price I was thinking about getting instead that has a dedicated GPU and although only comes with 16gb ram to start off I can upgrade the ram to 64 GB over time or possibly even higher but the display is a$$ only 1920 x 1080 but has sRGB100% so colors are at least accurate and it’s IPS so the viewing angles of the screen would be good and has a dedicated GPU RTX 4060 and has a better CPU in it core i7 13620H and I wouldn’t be playing game on this at all cuz I have a desktop computer with 540hz monitor and this would be such a downgrade and installing just one or 2 games would takes up all storage on my on it but having that GPU would future proof me if I ever need it later down the line but the fact I can get upgrade the ram to 64gb or more than just having 32Gb an stuck with that on the dell Inspiron is a huge help. But this it it:\nhttps://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-omen-16-1-165hz-full-hd-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-ddr5-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-1tb-ssd-shadow-black/6571057.p?skuId=6571057",

  "Yeahhh I’m just very indecisive cuz I’m used to having the best of the best when it comes to PC parts I usually don’t compromise anywhere but when I’m on a budget for laptop it makes it harder for me to decide cuz if I could go all out I’d either get the Razer Blade 18 with Mini LED Oled 360hz display Intel Core i9 14900hx rtx 4090 64gb ram version or if I’m going for looks I’d go the Lenovo legion 7i route in that stunning white color it’s half the price of the Razer blade 18 and comes with same specs as the Razer blade 18 and a better keyboard cuz Lenovo is known for making the best keyboard for laptops and that white just looks amazing. But anyways that’s besides the point but I’m in cybersecurity and I have around 8 or so VMs installed on computer at once and and I will be graduating next next year and I plan on going into the field of white hacking which from what I saw videos on and research on you need very powerful computers in them if you are having passwords using John the ripper trying to crack passwords. The one video I saw the people in the company who do this stuff only make the person with he best computer crack those passwords n stuff cuz the faster the computer is the faster the passwords will get cracked and you won’t be waiting weeks for the passwords to be cracked. But this can only be good for digital forensics if I ever do that cuz they do they same kind of stuff. But anyways the guy computer in he was using was a Ryzen threadripper Pro 7000 CPU with 64 cores and 128 threads with 256gb of ram and 2 RTX 4090. The lowest end guy like the guy with the worse specs was using a HP victus 15.6 inch with core i7 12650h and rtx 3050 with 16gb ram. I do need at least 1tb storage cuz downloading these VMs and partitioning all these drives and all the programs I need to download and all these disk files reports I need to create for digital forensics takes up a lot of storage so that’s why I was looking at the HP omen this one: https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=HP+omen&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys  but idk if it’s the exact same model as in this video I saw: https://youtu.be/UOdFBV4foNg?si=3IGI30oTkZZ14KUf  cuz in this video the guy said the display is crap on it and should never be used. I did get to see it in the store a bit but I didn’t get to se the colors other than blue because windows needed to be reinstalled on it so it was stuck on the blue screen. It didn’t look bad to me but I’ve only used 1920 x 1080 my entire life at 540hz cuz I stare at a benq zowie xl2586x TN panel not even IPS like these laptops are monitor all day for gaming and then my phone is the only other thing that is higher resolution than that but not like I notice really any difference other than if I’m not looking directly at the monitor I can’t see shit on it cuz it’s TN and viewing angles are a$$ on it. Anyways the point is idk if it’s the exact same HP omen as in his video cuz in the video he said the Canada version is a different model than the USA version and his version has exact same cpu and GPU and ram as the one I saw on Best Buy and it’s also made in 2023 the on on Best Buy and his version only has 144hz while the one on Best Buy in the USA is 165hz which makes me think the USA is different than the Canada version the one he has and maybe the USA one does have a better display on it. The easiest way to tell would be if he said if the Canada version the one he has has a sRGB rating of 45% 65% or 100% because the USA one on Best Buy is sRGB100%. But as you can see in this picture I only have opera GX opened and 8 taps opened and I’m already at 15.6GB used like how when all I have is 8 tabs opened and nothing else opened. The ram should not used by that much if I got the 16gb version of this dell inspition 16inch laptops the one I sent a picture of above I would have been cooked and all my ram would be gone. I don’t even have VMware or virtual box running and when I scroll through opera GX it lags so hard and YouTube videos or Netflix or anything I try to click on takes like a few minutes to load and most of the time it just freezes and doesn’t load at all and I have to refresh the page. \n\nI made sure windows everything on windows 10 windows 11 vm and windows 11 host PC is all turned off no animations no nothing to speed it up and not have more ram to be used but damnnn still the ram usage didn’t even go down still at 15.6GB being used. I just need to know by this Friday cuz that’s when the Black Friday deal ends and the laptop I have now the Dell Inspiron 16 inch 32Gb 2560 x 1600 mini LED sRGB100% HDR600 90hz even though on Best Buy they say it’s 165hz I tried different resolutions all of them and the refresh rate is still at 90hz only and it’s the same model as Best Buy shows and on Dells official website it shows 90hz so I’m guess it’s just a mistake by Best Buy’s end which they need to fix their false advertising but anyways technically without the Black Friday deal is $1500 new and the HP omen 16inch 165hz is $13000 so maybe the dell inspiron is better cuz it costs more but they both are the same price on Black Friday sale. The main selling point of the HP omen 16 inch for me was I can upgrade the ram to 64gb if needed which would make that laptop last me years into the bf you’re cuz I’m already hitting limits with even 32Gb ram and 64gb ram would help a lot more and probably solve all this lag issue on this dell Inspiron. I just hade the box chin at the bottom of the hp omen and the 16:9 display when every modern day laptop even the new razer blade 18s and Lenovo lesion 7i are 16:10 and that’s the same as the dell inspirion 16 inch I have now.",

  "Need help choosing next work laptop. I have two for your review. Hi all,\n\nI have a budget of no more than $1400.00. The laptop will be used with very large spreadsheets that are giving my current laptop trouble. i7-10510U with 16gb ddr4 1330MHz Windows 10 Pro Nvidia GeForce MX330\n\nThere are some good sales going on right now. I'm avoiding the $999 gaming laptops because of their abysmal battery life, how heavy they are, and the huge power supplies. But processor performance and ram are my main concerns. The ability to tackle a huge spreadsheet without having to close other programs or crash my pc. I don't really care about how pretty the screen is or if it has a dedicated graphics card. I don't think i really need either of those things.\n\nFor your consideration first up we have the: ThinkPad P16s Gen 2 AMD (16″) Mobile Workstation - Thunder Black that I can pickup direct from Lenovo's website for **$1,339.01**. Part Number 21K90038US It says it has the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 7840U Processor, Windows 11 Pro 64, integrated AMD Radeon™ 780M, 64 GB LPDDR5X-6400MHz (Soldered), 1 TB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 Performance TLC Opal. 4 Cell Li-Polymer 86Wh  \n[Lenovo ThinkPad direct from Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com/us/lenovopro/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadp/thinkpad-p16s-gen-2-16-inch-amd-mobile-workstation/21k90038us)\n\nSecond up we have the: Lenovo - Yoga Pro 9i 16\" 3.2K Touchscreen Laptop - Intel Core Ultra 9 185H with 32GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 - 1TB SSD - Luna Grey  Model:83DN0006US  SKU:6571367 that I can pickup from Best Buy for **$1,299.99** or less if I try to get one of their open box options.\n\n[Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i from Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-yoga-pro-9i-16-3-2k-touchscreen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-9-185h-with-32gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4050-1tb-ssd-luna-grey/6571367.p?skuId=6571367)\n\nThe price differences here aren't much, but the hardware setups are pretty different. I am attracted to the 64gb of ram on the one laptop, but it only has dedicated graphics which i think would be fine. The Yoga has an Nvidia 4050 and 32gb ram with a completely diff processor that looks to be slightly better. Another thing i considered is not getting too beastly of a pc that I can create spreadsheets fine, but when i share them with others their pc then crashes. Maybe i should stick to 32gb ram for that reason? I appreciate any input you can provide. Or even other recommendations would be welcome, although I would expect them to be around the same price point with better performance.",
  "ThinkPad, becaues it's a ThinkPad and is so much better built than the Yoga it's not even funny.",
  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",

  "Also the Spectre is 2-in-1/convertible, while the Yoga has a numpad. Might want to check the I/O on both in case there's an important difference for you. IDK what the price difference is but assuming the same price, you should pick based on which features you need the most. If it's mostly for gaming, or if you do a lot of data entry, then the Yoga has an advantage. If you want something for media or portability, then the Spectre.",

  "Hp envy 13 x360 (R5 4500U white) owner here. Bought it 2 weeks ago, have no problems. So far, there's only one frustrating thing: you can't power on the laptop if you leave it in tent or tablet mode, as the keyboard locks and doesn't respond until you convert it back to traditional laptop mode. \nPerformance is great, so far I've been playing rocket league (stable 60 fps in medium settings 720p) and teardown (720p with 100% render size and high graphics). Gives me 40-60 fps, which is decent. Keyboard is nice, battery life is awesome (I got slightly less than 10 hours of watching videos on 70-100% brightness). 100% sRGB screen is really cool, my unit has pretty much no screen bleed (whatever it's called). I have a 8gb unit and Minecraft (100+ mods) runs at 30-50 fps, but the problem here is in RAM. Portal runs fine, something like 200+ fps. 16GB and R7 is super cool. Ask any questions you want, I'll try to respond.\n\nEDIT1: You may want a laptop with dedicated GPU, because although Vega 6 is great, it may not be enough for heavy video editing, which I haven't tried, as I'm not familiar with editing software.",

  "Lenovo Yoga 720 15 (4K) Review Hey all. As the titles says, I recently bought the new Lenovo Yoga 720 - the 15 inch, 4k model. Here are my thoughts after about two weeks of us. For the record, I bought this laptop as a replacement for the now old Asus Zenbook Pro, so many of my opinions are based on comparisons with that laptop. There is a quick & and dirty tl;dr at the end.\n\nI bought my model at Best Buy at a discounted rate. It has the following specs.

It feels very light for a 15 inch laptop, even though it’s only half a pound lighter than the Zenbook Pro. In handling it, I don’t hear any worrying creaks or sounds or anything of that nature. That goes especially for the 360 degree hinge. I was a bit skeptical about how long it would last but, after using it, I think it can go the distance under reasonable strain. Overall, I would rank the build quality above that of the Zenbook Pro, slightly.\n\nKeyboard: Lenovo’s expertise with keyboards shows here. It has pretty good key travel and feels comfortable. It’s a bit of a learning curve for me because my past laptops have included a number pad along with the keyboard (this gives the overall keyboard a pronounced shift to the left). The Yoga 720 doesn’t have a number pad, so the keyboard is centered. Whether that’s a win or a loss is up to you – but I don’t miss the number pad. Keyboard also comes with backlight which has 2 lvls of brightness… to be honest, the two levels are hardly different – still, it’s nice to have. \n\nTrackpad: Also very good. It is very precise and, texture wise, actually reminds me of the Macbook Pro (minus the size, of course). No complaints at all with the trackpad.\n\nDisplay: This is both the laptop’s strongest and one of its weakest aspects. The screen is nice and very sharp – it actually made me look at the Zenbook Pro’s screen (also 4k) with a bit of disappointment. It’s a bit brighter than the Pro (maybe around 300 nits) and is, again, very sharp. I don’t have a colorimeter or a way of measuring color gamut but, to my naked eye, it looks to have better contrast and colors than the Zenbook, and I know that the Zenbook has somewhere North of 100% of sRGB. The XPS-like lack of bezels is also a very nice touch and helps reduce the overall footprint of the machine. \n\nMy opinion on the screen (which is touch, BTW) would be blazingly positive were it not for a long line of black, dead pixels that appeared after maybe 5 or 6 days of use. The line is diagonal and streaks horizontally across the top of the screen. It’s actually not too incredibly distracting as doesn’t stray more than a millimeter away from the edge of the screen. Still, it’s clearly a manufacturing defect. I will talk more about my experience trying to get this rectified later when I discuss warranty issues….\n\nSpeakers: They are okay. Much better than the tinny speakers on the Zenbook Pro, but nothing too incredibly special. Probably good enough to watch movies and certainly good enough to watch videos. I mostly use headphones, anyway. \n\nStorage: Fast AF. ‘Nuff said. \n\nGaming: I’m not a very heavy gamer, but I do play games such as World of Tanks and Armored Warfare, among others. Set at 1080p, it does do a good job of playing those games at medium-high settings. As expected, it does outperform the 960m on the Zenbook Pro, though not by an incredibly wide margin. Don’t expect to play anything at 4k, though. \n\nCooling: Laptop remains remarkably cool under load. In situations (gaming, for example) where I would expect the Zenbook Pro to reach 80 or 90 degrees C with a laptop cooling pad, the Yoga 720 would sit at 65 or lower without a cooler. I can put my hand underneath the grate on the bottom and actually feel cool air coming out. That’s pretty impressive, given how compact it is. \n\nPhoto Editing: I don’t have experience using Photoshop, but I do use Capture NX-D to retouch my photos. Surprisingly enough, the Zenbook Pro actually performed better. The photo previews came up faster and edits were generated quicker on the Zenbook pro. Given that the Yoga 720 has the better CPU, Integrated Graphics, and dGPU, I am assuming this is any issues with drivers and optimization. Regardless, the performance gap is not very big and I have no issue with using the Yoga over the Pro for photo editing.\n\nBattery Life: Admittedly, I am too much of a power-user to ever just sit and use my laptop moderately for long enough to completely run out the battery. That being said, from what un-plugged use I have had, I think you could easily manage 5-6 hours on a charge with keyboard backlight off and brightness set to 60% or lower. Perhaps more if you were really anemic with your usage. Given the fact that it has a 4k display and only a 74 whr battery, that’s pretty impressive.\n\nWifi: It couldn’t be all fun and roses now, could it? I am not sure if I got a bad copy or not, but the wifi capability of this laptop is quite bad. I’ll offer a few real-world examples: in one case, I was staying somewhere where the wifi router was located in a common area, and where I slept was perhaps 25 feet away from that area. While sitting in the common area – perhaps 6 or 7 feet away from the router – the connection was very strong, as expected. No issues here. However, when I moved to my room, the signal would fall out almost completely. It would be almost impossible to get onto the web. The odd part is that I actually still have the Zenbook Pro with me and it connects perfectly fine from the farther location (for the record, it has a the Intel 7265 wireless card). I dare say it connects almost as if it were still only 6 feet from the router, yet the Lenovo just can’t. I’ve downloaded all of the intel and Lenovo updates, but the connection still remains unstable and weak. \n\nI am actually hoping this is a matter of a bad wifi card, because the alternative is that most models of this laptop may have this issues of poor wifi connectivity. It is quite sad, because I find it to be a very good laptop, but this is a borderline deal breaker for me, personally. If you don’t plan on being very far away from your router, though, then this shouldn’t be a (big) problem for you. \n\nQC and Warranty: Regarding warranty, my situation is a bit exceptional. I bought this laptop in the US and, within 3 days, I left the country to travel to Asia (I am still there). After experiencing these QC issues involving the screen and the wifi, I took it to a Lenovo support office out here. I came to find out that, According to Lenovo, there are certain models of the laptop made for western countries, and certain models made for Asia. I had the model made for the west (obviously), and so the Asian centers didn’t have the necessary parts to replace or repair the laptop – either the screen or the wifi. To translate the agent directly, she said something like “this model does not exist in Asia.” My warranty is still very much valid and I can still get it addressed, I just have to do it whenever I return to the states.\n\nOn that note, there was a bit of a disagreement with the wifi. I told them about my experience with both laptops regarding the similar positioning but vastly different connectivity results, but the agent connected to the office’s wifi and connected without a problem. She went on to say that the office router was actually far away, and yet the laptop connected just fine. That being the case, I am not sure what’s going on – whether there is an issue with the router, with my wifi card, or something else…\n\nConclusion: When I first got this laptop, I was eager to find what sort of corners Lenovo cut in order to produce it so cheaply. For the first several days, I simply couldn’t find those corners. The laptop functioned admirably during that time, to the point where I was ready to say that Lenovo had produced a winner. With the QC issues, though, that kind of comes into question. If you can manage to snag a model without these issues, I imagine you will be very happy with your purchase. I know that I would be!\n\nTl;dr: very capable machine. If you can get past some possible QC control issues, Lenovo has a winner here. \n\nOpen to questions/comments 😊\n",
  "Looks like a pretty decent laptop. ",
  "gtx1050 is not a good display card I think. Its too weak conpared with the power of 1060and 1070.1060 is better than 980 while 1070 is better than 980ti. But the 1050 are even weaker than 960. Sick.",
  "Also had this laptop for a bit. The glossy panel is SO reflective. If you have to do any kind of color sensitive or just intensely detailed work anywhere with natural light, get another laptop. (imo)",
  "Just a note concerning the \"dead pixels\"- I have the exact same problem, and having read through some other forums (and finding someone who took the screen apart) it appears that it's actually an internal piece that's come undone. From what I can gather, it only affects the 4K screens. Regardless, on mine it's less noticeable than you'd think: it doesn't even reach the \"x\" in the top-right hand corner of Chrome. That it hasn't gotten any worse since the issue cropped up a couple of weeks ago is also good news- at this level it's hardly an issue (I'm actually more annoyed at the fact that the Thunderbolt port has 2 lanes rather than 4 (it seems like a lot of current laptops are like that, though).",
  "Most 1070 to 980 Ti comparisons aren't clocked at equal limits. The 980 Ti when overclocked actually comes close to or surpasses the 1070. I don't quite remember what their FPS numbers come down to when both are at the absolute limit, but between the 1070 and 980 Ti it's kind of a wash. Well aside from maybe some of the new driver options and optimizations (if any) the 1070 has going for it.",
  "Yes. you are right.  Im only to show my disappointment to 1050. Actually 1070 always have the same performance with 980ti and when they are both unlocked 980ti will be a little bit stronger. Same for 980 and 1060. I suppose that 1050 are equal to970 or only weaker a little bit, but the reallity is that its even weaker than 960. WHAT A PITY！",
  "Dell XPS 13 Vs Yoga 910 For A Student/Software Developer/Graphic Designer Before I'll start I'm not really asking for a recommendation so the form isn't necessary here, I already have two final options and I only need help choosing which. \n\nI've read almost any review and watched any video about the top ultrabooks on the market currently and got to the conclusion these two (XPS 13 & Yoga 910) are the best for me. \n\n**Lenovo Yoga 910-13 Glass Touch Screen**  with glass lid, \nIntel® Core i7-7500U Processor, 4M Cache, 2.7 GHz up to 3.50 GHz, \n8GB DDR4 2133MHz (1 x 8GB) On-board, Up to 16 GB\nHD, \n512GB SSD PCIe, \n13.9 Inch UHD IPS Multi-touch (3840x2160)\n4K Touch Screen, \nIntel® HD Graphics 620. \n\nAnd the **Dell XPS 13 9360 Without Touch Screen** which has Intel® Core? i7-7500U Processor, 4M Cache, 2.7 GHz up to 3.50 GHz, \n8GB LPDDR3 1866MHz, \n256GB SD, \n13.3 inch FHD AG (1920 x 1080) InfinityEdge display\nAnd Intel® HD Graphics 620. \n\nBoth are practically the same but the Yoga has more space, touch screen and the ability to transform into a laptop, and of course it looks a lot nicer IMHO... \n\nI'm a software engineering student, the main uses will obviously be studying and coding, including Visual Studio  and even Android emulators which are a bit heavy. \nI also like a computer that will allow me to do some light Photoshop editing, I have a desktop PC which allows me the heavy stuff but I'd like to do it on the go as well. \nI'm going to use Windows 10 and probably some Linux distro on a partition so I guess I need more than 256GB of space, I have external 4TB drive so I don't need too much space. \n\nAnyway, the reason I ask you guys is because anywhere I looked the xps 13 is considered as the best there is, but the 13 inch screen is really frightening me and I doubt a few hours of coding will be easy on such a screen. \nAlso, the yoga with the glass lid I ask about is stunning, and has the Fingerprint sensors, which both are maybe not that important but a great bonus. \n\nAbout battery, its not really an important issue, of course I'll want it to be able to run for a few hours without charging, but I'm not intending to go on long trips with it, at least not more then 5 hours with no charging option. \n\nI'm really clueless about which of them I want I'd like the yoga more unless every review would tell me to take the XPS but, are all the reviews are true? Is the 13\" screen really going to be a problem? \n\nThanks! ",

  "I've used visual studio enough to know that I would absolutely hate working with it on a smaller screen.  Especially if you're writing windows form applications or using the drag and drop designer for ASP.NET stuff.",
  "Why not move up into the 15\" class? Dell XPS 15 inch starts at 999; for 1200 you also get an NVIDIA 1050 IIRC. ",
  "Thanks for your answer, but let's assume I'm going to use it for graphics and such for only about 15% of the time, and the rest goes for studying software engineering and for development, would your answer still be relevant? ",
  "14\" screen is considered as small as the 13 or is it acceptable? "
