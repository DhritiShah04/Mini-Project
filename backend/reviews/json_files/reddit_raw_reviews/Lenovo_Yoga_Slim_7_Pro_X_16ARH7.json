  "Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition, AMA? Just received the laptop like 10 minutes ago\nWill try to answer some questions. \nIf you guys want any benchmarks, I can try to do it as well. Battery life those I dont think i can give any at the moment as its fresh out of box.\n\n\n",
  "does it give u unlimited aura",
  "For those that was wondering if pressing the power button does anything when the lid is down and closed,\n\nThe answer is\n\nNo, it does not. You cant switch off your laptop as well even if you press it long enough for normal pc to force shut down. And you cant turn on your laptop as well. Hope this info helps for those worried about the laptop switching itself on in their backpacks.\n\nThough, the laptop does switch itself on by itself when you open the lid, after you shut it down and close the lid (similar to how macbooks are like); add in: just found out you can switch that off in Lenovo Vantage",
  "What's the meaning of death? Well you said anything...",
  "Install Linux, any distro, tell me it works",
  "Specs?",
  "Got one of these today for testing/review..    Fun fact, you can just leave Battery Saver mode on, disable the Lenovo service that tries to change power limits..  Use Throttlestop to max out the TDP (Lunar Lake doesn't go past 40watts anyways) and let it rip.   The machine stays very very quiet and pulls of a 11,3xx CB23 score which is actually a good bit faster than any review i've seen.  The best part is how cool to the touch this machine is under load/gaming..  Probably the coolest running chassis in a long time, granted the CPU is only pulling like 20\\~ watts while gaming even though I have it set at 40w (game dependent of course will change this).    It's a wonderful machine overall, not perfect but pretty amazing as a daily driver.   Battery tests coming soon..   I previously have tested the Dell XPS 13 with Lunar Lake so that's all I have to compare to so far.",
  "how are the hinges",
  "Will you try out linux?",
  "A few things to add in;\n\nLaptop keyboard so far is fantastic, they feel more like the good old membrane keyboard; and definitely feels a lot better to type on compare to laptops like Zephyrus. So far I do feel a Thinkpad's keyboard is definitely better than the Yoga series.\n\nPerformance so far is alright. Gotta test more first before I continue with anything else. \n\nIts a bit unfair to compare like this, but I do get a better experience off with a MBP 14 M1 Pro as the laptop seems more fluid compared to this. Currently I am testing the laptop with Best Performance mode; using mainly chrome with a few tabs (shopping + light browsing) and some Excel work.",
  "Sleep mode battery usage:\n\nI left the laptop at 45% on sleep for around 45 hours, \n\nI'm left with around 29% after I open the lid back up.",

  "So, the laptop is pretty awesome. I’ve had it all week and have found that it’s gotten better with use. The first day I almost took it back because the touchpad was so bad and their own Lenovo Vantage application kept crashing. Once all the updates took effect and the laptop had time to settle in, there were no more issues. \n\nThe WiFi is incredibly fast, and I’ve never experienced a faster initial connection and any device ever, including iPads and iPhones and MacBooks. Instantaneous to the router as soon as your password is in. \n\nThe main feature of the snapdragon version was supposed to be the “snappiness” and the battery life. But this thing has been nothing but snappy—everything happens instantaneously. I’ve never had a machine this responsive. It’s like having your car switch gears without ever feeling the change in the transmission, just unbelievably smooth. That being said, nothing will be the battery life on a Mac, so there’s no real reason to compare. Their ARM efficiency is so vastly ahead of the competition that it’s not even a fair comparison. They’re strange machines to me (MacBooks) in that their computing power is unrivaled, but their interface makes them look like toys for kids rather than serious machines, which I suppose they are but just never really feel that way. My use case on the daily is for Windows-based computing, so that’s why I returned the m3 air I bought earlier this year (that and their new keyboard is awful, paper thin and the keys so closely placed I couldn’t type properly. I was going to lose my mind). Was able to get through work days with no battery life issues, ended up around 40% every day with about 5-6 hours of use, so definitely use dependent. I am not sure if the battery is compromised by having to run a virtual desktop all day? I’m sure someone here can better attest to that. \n\nThe screen is glorious—I’ve never been a fan of OLED for a laptop so that’s actually a plus for me. I almost went and bought a refurbished Lenovo for the mini LED screen it featured, but it was much bigger and heavier than this laptop. \n\nThe portability is insane; the engineering to pack a 15.3” screen while using essentially the body of a 14” laptop is mind boggling. I was reliant on my 2018 intel MacBook Air (still just perfect except for the giant bezels and dwindling battery life) until the aura, and, when you place the 13.3” air over the aura there’s only minimal excess laptop all around. Just an exceedingly slim experience. \n\nI wish the materials were just a tad more premium, with the feeling of the sleek aluminum from the Air still more solid in the hand. Being able to open the laptop with one hand would have been nice, but life goes on. \n\nThe x1carbon aura will probably be the perfect machine w the haptic pad and the choice of oled or IPS based on your preference, so if you’re willing to wait and spend double the cash for the same specs and a one pound lighter laptop then I would do so. I didn’t think it was worth all the extra cash for the upgraded materials, essentially doubling the cost. The HD is fast enough, and for my purposes shelling out extra for a 2280 disk would have made no discernible difference in daily use. \n\nAll in all, stunning and I’m glad I waited for this instead of the yoga 9i meteor lake which was what I was considering previously. \n\n32g \n1 tb \nWindows 11 pro\nAt no additional cost on Lenovos website I was able to also add Office Pro and Acrobat 2020, so that’s an extra $500 or so of software. Good deal right now\n\nArrow Lake and Panther Lake look promising. The future is bright for intel, and the spinoff on their design business is going to be one to invest in for sure.",

I'm just a bit miffed about the lack of OLED screen, and slightly concerned about reviewers saying it's performance is just a bit slower on multi-core, but probably doesn't make a difference for basic usage.",
  "Could you take a picture with the flash turned on and just have it showing a black screen, but put it next to another glossy screen and a matte screen if possible, with all of them tilting to face the camera?\n\nOne of my biggest pain points might be that it doesn't have an anti-reflective coating. \n\nRegular laptops have not very good anti-reflective coatings. \n\nThe Asus g16 with a ryzen 370 AI has a really good anti-reflective coating.\n\nBut then, this has better battery life than any X86 Windows laptop.",
  "Very curious about its abilities to do basic video editing (like having one or two B rolls and simple cuts and transitions with iPhone 1080p footage and footage from a Sony mirror less alpha a6000 - not 4k)\nAnd things like running a live stream with lbs studio and two cameras and an audio interface",

It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do? I bought this from BestBuy in the U.S., but I’m currently not in the United States.

  "It's made out of aluminum, but when i played around with the yoga 9i and the slim 7x they just felt like better quality. The one thing I didn't mention was the keyboard--it's phenomenal. The main reason I didn't consider the HP or the ASUS, the two main competing lunar lake laptops that look really phenomenal, was that I really disliked their keyboards. This is the best typing experience I may have ever had on a laptop. It's not that this computer isn't well built--it certainly is, it has the military grade durability and so on, but it just doesn't have a \"pro\" look or feel. You can tell it's consumer-grade material. It's like comparing a commercial kitchen product to a consumer grade line--they may be moth stainless steel but there's just a difference in the quality that's probably related objectively in some way, but it's difficult for me to describe or quantify. Please note this is a really nitpicky thing to say--this is the best laptop I've ever owned, and it's not close. I was between this and a macbook pro14\", but I'm super satisfied and felt like it was a great deal to upgrade the RAM to 32 and the 1 tb HD w the free office pro/acrobat std. Really good deal and very high quality with an excellent processor. The silence and coolness of the laptop are really evident as well. I played COD MWIII just to see how it ran compared to my prior Microsoft Surface Book 2 from 2017 which had 16 gb ram and a NVDA 3050 card, and it's not even close how smooth and well this computer handled it. \n\n  \nWould highly recommend if the OLED was an issue for you, because most manufacturers seem to be going OLED route, so if you are happy w the Snapdragon chip and there's no compatibility issues, the only real competitor here would be the Surface laptop, which would cost you another 1500 to have all of the above specs/software. I have been waiting to see what was next for my laptop world since it's been so long, I had to learn a lot about the chip game to understand what I was waiting for. I think the only thing I'd say is if you're not in a hurry, see how these compare to Strix point laptops. If you're like me and have more basic needs that aren't super tech dependent, this is an excellent daily driver. Of course if you have a specialized need you're probably not in this forum anyhow. \n\n\n\nFor the money, you can't get a better laptop. \n\n  \nHope that helps!",

  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",

  "Thanks for this insightful review.\nRegarding the fan noise, is it possible to use tpfancontrol (or more recent) to customise it ? On both T15 (Gen 1) and L14 they work well to start the fan sooner than the firmware does, but I do not know whether it is possible to delay the fan startup...\nThanks,\nP.S. : additional question : what is the lowest rpm that tpfancontrol can achieve ?",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",

It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do?

  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues. And if anyone has solved the above issues i'd like to know how to fix it. (I tried bloat removal and even windows reinstall but the issue still persists)",

  "As I sit here looking at my non-upgradeable to Windows 11 Surface Book 2.  You felt and looked premium, I paid a lot for your middle tier processor, I learned what heat throttling was, sometimes you think the screen is disconnected when it isn't, we had a good run. No more MS laptops for me thanks.",
  "Just read it, some great detailed insights there. Definitely swaying me towards getting the SL7, especially given the low/no noise from the fans which is very important to me. Thanks for replying!",
  "How would you compare the screen reflectivity between the SL7 and the Aura? Still waiting for my Aura to arrive",
  "OK, thanks for trying, it is good to know that it is not compatible... by the way, there are several variants, depending on the model (eg 1 or 2 fans) : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qjlal2/tpfan_control_on_newer_thinkpads_share_your/\n\nOn the Aura, there is also a built-in BIOS configured power management, accessible through Fn+Q command : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1fufeoa/lenovo_yoga_slim_7i_aura_edition_ama/lqcjek5/",
  "What if you set the performance/fan mode to quiet? Does that make it quiet enough? I'm thinking of getting this too and have heard mixed reviews about fan noise",
  "Ya, it’s been hit or miss on battery life. Touchpad gets finicky w longer use, appears to be pretty sensitive to the oils on the skin and any grime so I try to use the mouse. I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",
  "Its actually not too bad in person (at best buy) when viewed side by side to the book 4 screen.   I think the book 5 screen has more anti-reflective coating and they did not have that model for testing.",
  "Is the reflection problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "Does anyone tried this?",
  "It had been on sales for £1100 for the Aura 258V 32GB RAM model in the UK (e.g. Lenovo Store, Currys).",

  "Tell me how the type of graphics card can affect eye strain. Eye strain and other discomforts are caused by PWM and temporal dithering. These are defects or characteristics of displays, and intervening components are unlikely to be the cause, but I could be wrong. Please comment.",
  "I exchanged it",
  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast. The screen is very glossy though. if you work in a very bright room with bright background/light behind you, then yeah it can be very annoying to clearly see your reflection on the screen even at 80% brightness. it's depends see if you can find a sample in the nearest store.",
  "I like your little candy cane for scale",
  "Can you share me the settings that you have used while testing this and was there any major tweaks done to this? I got the same laptop but seems like my idle drain is little bit higher, although I did clean install of windows.",

  "Ah, interesting. Looks like a universal issue then.",
  "Both are glossy glass surfaces, but I remember the SL7 looked less reflective. The aura can look a bit mirror-like at times.",
  "My bluetooth is awful.  I can pair all devices, but they will NOT stay connected.  My earbuds connected, and I was able to use them for about 1 minute or so, but I could only get the Right side to receive sound.

The internet is full of people with the same bluetooth issue.",
  "Yes, a few people on reddit shared their experience of this already. They said the outcome is comparable to the new M4 nano texture screen coating. Less reflection but more grainy, as you would expect.",
  "I am going to buy this laptop soon. \n\nIs there display glare problem a deal breaker?\n\n  \nSome people mentioned : glossy displays leading to poor battery life because you have to crank up brightness to max to combat glare.\n\nI am a software developer, i opened many tabs, run heavy tools like docker, visual studio and local database servers.",
  "You could try to check if the problem is related to your Windows install, or a hardware issue (e.g. WiFi chip, antenna connection). \n\nOne relatively easy way would be to create a Linux bootable USB stick (e.g. Ubuntu). Boot up from the Linux USB stick and check the WiFi speeds. \n\nIf the speeds in Linux are normal, you could then try a \"clean install\" of Windows (download Windows USB install media from Microsoft website).\n\nIf the WiFi speed in Linux is also very low, then it might be worth opening up the laptop and checking the WiFi chip and antennas (does not void warranty). Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",

  "Yeah, for some reason it worked fine for me or maybe I just didn't notice it. I think a few BIOS updates can fix some of these pesky annoying issues in otherwise an ideal laptop.",
  "Now I'm thinking to just get the Yoga Pro 9i with the IPS. Should check all the boxes. Just not the battery life",
  "It is a glossy screen, so some glare is there, but not anything significant to be a deal breaker. Battery life has been excellent so far, usually lasts 5 to 8 hours on a single charge of 80%.",

  "If it's dropped like that again it will be Number 1, or very near it. Prices are a rollercoaster at this time of year and there's not much in it. There's a whisker between these and choosing what suits you best will leave you with a great laptop either way.",
  "The 9i looks like a nice machine especially with mini-LED, but the chassis is quite cheaply made, like the Pro 7. All plastic interior, including the hinge assembly.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

So you may have to try the links a few times. \n\nIf you have good WiFi speeds with an external USB WiFi dongle then this is also indicative of a hardware issue. I suggest you find a friend who can help you check out the WiFi inside your laptop.",
  "For the benchmarks, i go for the max possible score. I'll have Windows Set to Best Power efficiency and the Vendor's app set to maximum efficiency (no overclocking, USB charging turned off, silent mode if not low power, disable diacreet GPU if relevant etc).

  "hi I am someone using this laptop for a month. Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo. I have a desktop that goes 165hz and that's more for gaming. sure it's smooth and all but eh not worth the batt life tradeoff).\n\nif you realllly wanna stretch the life, use MS edge as ur browser cuz that's the least battery draining browser out there.

Unfortunately, she decided return the laptop after just one week as the case kept splitting open at the front under the touchpad. This indicates some poor built quality. I tried it out myself for a bit and also found the feeling and aesthetics rather on the cheap and plasticky side. The system also felt very sluggish and performed poorly in everyday web browsing and office tasks.\n\nAfter the MSI Prestige, I recommended my friend to get a full aluminium Lenovo Yoga 7i 14\" instead.

I only learned this after a month of waiting for it to arrive and it being in the ready to ship stage, still showing that they had stock. When the error was discovered they offered to cancel my order and find a machine that “fit” my needs at whatever price they were selling it at. No, I wanted a machine with the closest specifications at the price that I ordered and paid for the first one that you said you had in stock. They didn’t budge at all. I ordered a machine at $250, the next one that had the closest specifications was $750. The original price of the machine I ordered was $950.

  "Most likely true. I work at a very large company and work in picking and shipping orders, and it's generally the same for every company. If a product is in stock and is purchased, the order is automatically added to the queue and dropped in the next wave of orders for the warehouse workers to pick and ship it. \n\nMany times the packlist/order receipt will show the total price of the order, but nobody really pays attention and even if a warehouse grunt sees it, they will assume nothing and still send it out. No managers or financial workers will see the order until well after it is shipped and delivered in most cases",
  "I have worked at a popular grocery store for over a decade. In the U.S. if a store has a price sign in front of a product that indicates an incorrect price, we have to honor it. Otherwise it’s called bait and switch. I have no idea how this is handled online or internationally however.",
  "They don’t. Law undergraduate here. This falls under contract law. A website listing or product is considered as an **invitation to treat**, and not an **offer**. To define an offer, I will quote it from the case of Preston Corpn Sdn Bhd v Edward Leong: An offer is an intimation of willingness by an offeror to enter into a legally binding contract. Its terms either expressly or impliedly must **indicate** that it is to **become binding on the offeror** (buyer) assoon as it has been **accepted by the offeree** (seller).\n\nEven if the customer were to send an offer (by checking out), a **binding contract** is not yet formed because Lenovo has yet to accept that offer and they can choose to back out as there is no **legally enforceable agreement** yet. (A confirmation email is also not signifying of acceptance of order!)\n\nA similar example to this would be Chwee Kin Keong v Digiland Mall Pte Ltd. TLDR is that an employee keyed in a pricing for a product at $66 instead of $3,854 (MSRP) and the company obviously didn’t want to fulfil orders that were made and got taken to court. Court ruled in the company’s favour.\n\nIn consumer court, courts do consistently rule in favour of the seller during obvious pricing mistakes like a $1 phone etc. because they take the view of a **reasonable person in consideration and apply the objectivity test**. \n\nFor example, in this case, the court said:\n“I find ... that the plaintiffs, given each of their backgrounds, would in any event, each have separately realised and appreciated, before placing their purchase orders,that a manifest mistake had occurred – even if no communications on the error had taken place between them. Further, the character of the mistake was such that **any reasonable person** similarly circumstanced as each of the plaintiffs would have had every reason to believe that a manifest error had occurred.” . \n\nOtherwise, the court would also simply treat it as a **clerical or unilateral mistake** and not punish the seller. Similarly in this case, Lenovo would win.\n\nIf there’s any Law graduates reading this and want to improve on my stand, please do! I’m still studying and open to improvement",

  "True, but I was just giving an example to explain. However, if we look at it in layman terms, the universal legal principle will be the same. You simply cannot reasonably expect to enforce a contract based on a price that is **obviously an error**. So in any jurisdiction, I’m highly confident that Lenovo would win should this be taken to court. \n\nIf you search up similar topics, you will find that across common law (Singapore, UK, US) and civil law (France, Germany, EU), the courts follow the same reasoning:\n1.\tObvious pricing errors = no binding contract.\n2.\tBuyers cannot exploit a mistake they recognize.\n3.\tThe worst that happens to the retailer is refunding the money.\n\nHowever, if we are referring to say, a $599 MSRP laptop being listed erroneously at $499, the court may order the seller to honor some of the orders, which has happened in many jurisdictions before, since borderline errors (e.g., 10–25% off normal price) can be interpreted as a discount/promotion and would lead a reasonable person to believe that there is no mistake in pricing.\n\nIn this case though, it’s a laptop for $1. So it’s pretty obvious and no court would side with the buyer.",
  "Incorrect.\nTL;DR Lenovo (and most other companies) explicitly states that a confirmation email does **NOT** signify acceptance of the order. **No acceptance = No contract.** (This clause is commonplace for every business) Consumer will lose if he tries to go to court, even if he has the best lawyer. Below, I will cite Lenovo.\n\n**Full explanation:**\n\nA confirmation email, if you dig deep into any businesses’s Terms and Conditions (the thing that everyone ignores), has built in protective clauses in their Terms of Sale, and they’re not obliged to provide the consumer with any goods or service with a confirmation email alone. **Confirmation email ≠ acceptance.** A confirmation email only signifies that they have **received** the order.\n\nHere, I will specifically cite for this case, Lenovo. Under their T&Cs, it clearly states that **a confirmation of Lenovo receiving and/or processing your order does not constitute acceptance of the order.** (1.2)\n\nSource: https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/legal/new-products-and-warranty-services/?srsltid=AfmBOop9YcXqtlgbWWSEtLd4WCy7paTFtCMABKIs8xZmfYyPvIBRyTbc&ut\n\nIt also states under 1.1 that:\n\n1.1) **No contract** for the purchase of Products or Services will be formed until Lenovo accepts your Order by **one of the following**:\n\n**(a)** shipping the hardware Product and sending you a shipment confirmation email; or\n\n**(b)** making the software Product available to you; or\n\n**(c)** providing the Service to you.\n\nTherefore, that confirmation email is **not a binding acceptance** and is more of an acknowledgment that they’ve received your order and are processing it. Until shipping occurs (or software is delivered, etc.), Lenovo **reserves the right** to cancel or adjust your order **even if** you’ve already received a confirmation email or any other form of confirmation.\n\nI personally think that TV shows these days make the law seem very shallow to the average person, like; “Little guy sues company and wins!”. \n\nThe reality is, that every business has multiple built in protective and failsafe clauses layered into their contracts etc. to make sure that real consumers **will never win against them** in court. I feel like the average person should read more into the T&Cs so they know what they’re getting themselves into, but we don’t, so companies take advantage of that; and that is why we have lawyers :)",

  "No coil whine and I don't believe this one has liquid metal, so no leakage issues there. Overall, it's been great. The build quality is pretty solid, but it's not as good as the MacBook or the Razer Blade I had. However, Razer got rid of the glass on their displays, which has led to them feeling lower quality to me, and lesser in comparison to the Macs that still use glass. The bottom panel is a cheap plastic one which again, feels lesser in quality vs those other two, but it's not something I notice in my regular usage because it's either docked or on a desk and then going in and out of a bag. \n\nIt has a minor issue on the trackpad, but it's still very usable, just annoying. Since I rarely use the trackpad and use external M&K when at home, or a mouse and the built-in keyboard while traveling, it's not a big deal. \n\nPerformance-wise, I'm still able to max out all of my games on absolutely Ultra settings including Path Tracing on Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2 with good frame rates on my external 34\" Ultrawide. When playing on the 2560x1600 internal display, performance is obviously even better. \n\nI bought this because I needed the absolute most power possible in the lightest, most portable package possible. I traveled for work weekly for the past few years, and I travel regularly, so having this has been a godsend. I remember playing Warzone in LaGuardia at one of the bars when my flight got delayed and blowing off steam was great. I took this to QuakeCon for 3 years now, and the ability to pack more power than my desktop into something that fits in my backpack is amazing.  \n\nComing from a Mac, probably your biggest hurdle is going to be battery life, but the latest CPUs are supposedly much better in that regard (though we hear that every generation so YMMV).",

The integrated microphone is *extremely* good for a laptop, hands down best laptop mic I've heard.

  "Old ones okay maybe if decently priced. Problem are new ones, being super overpriced while offering very little. An example : A mid range T14 G5 with a core ultra 5 125U, 60hz 1200p sRGB IPS display, 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage, which for those two are getting below today's standard, is priced at 1200€. Those are specs you'd find on a 600-700€ laptop, not a 1200€ laptop. At 1000€ you can already get something well built with a Ryzen 7 8th gen, 32gb of ram and 1tb of storage (Asus Zenbook, HP Elitebook, etc). In this case that laptop OP showed was a pretty fine deal, but if you took a Thinkpad for the same price you'd have an E14 Gen 6 with even worse specs. They stay good, don't get me wrong : but at any price range there's pretty much always a better deal.",

  "Keyboard's alright. As for the burn in, I think it'll be fine, especially if you don't run max brightness (the screen is very bright, even half brightness is much brighter than most laptop screens) and auto hide taskbar. Bonus point if you use a OLED friendly theme (iirc the O365 suite has one where the background and ui is pure black). Those are only preventive measures and not really 100% necessary unless you're really scared.",

  "Strangely it's hard to find an 8845hs or 8840u ddr5, good battery life + screen laptop here in India without overpaying a lot. \nBut I found an almost equally good Ryzen 7 AI 350 laptop with 860M igpu, 32 GB ddr5 5600 MT, 60wh fast charge. I think that'll be almost equally good as your laptop?",
  "so the intel would be the better choice ? between it doesn't have the multi threading capabilities, that's why i hesitate",
  "The ai 7 350 has a weaker iGPU but is normally slightly better than the 8845hs, would be close or even better since it also consumes less.",

  "Lenovo Yoga 7i Gen10, 14-inch laptop (2025) review **UK-based Laptop Review**\n\n**1. Title:**  \nLenovo Yoga 7i Gen 10 (2025) Review: power and portability\n\n**2. Introduction:**\n\nThis is a review for the 2025 yoga 7i gen 10 model from Lenovo with intel core ultra 7 258v and 14 inch screen. I bought the configuration from the UK Lenovo website with 32GB RAM, 1TB SDD, 2.8k OLED 120Hz screen, Luna Grey colour and optioned the fingerprint scanner for an additional £10, paying £1090 in total (including the 10% VIP discount for healthcare workers). This is a premium grade 2-in-1 consumer laptop with a solid build, great for anyone who needs a portable and powerful device.\n\nI haven’t seen many user reviews for this particular generation of laptop so thought it would be useful for anyone considering it.\n\n**3. Design and Build Quality:**\n\nThe chassis all metal, which gives it a very solid feel. The build quality is great, there’s very little flex in the case or the keyboard. The body does not pick up fingerprints. At 1.4kg, it’s not the lightest laptop but it’s still very portable. It fits my 13 inch laptop sleeve. I don’t have much use for the tablet mode as I find it too cumbersome when compared with holding an actual tablet. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and the trackpad is smooth and accurate. I appreciate the double height enter key. Coming from the LG gram 16, this is a much better typing and trackpad experience.\n\nPort selection is good. There are 2 USB-C ports, one on either side, with one USB-A, one full-sized HDMI, a microSD card slot and a headphone jack. The power key is on the right side which I’ve mis-pressed a couple of times so I’ve disabled it in the settings.\n\nThe display is a 14-inch glossy OLED touchscreen with 2.8K resolution (2880 x 1800), 500 nits brightness (1100 nits HDR Peak). I find the screen bright and vibrant. Watching video in a dimmed room is fantastic with zero light bleed. Reflections and fingerprints can be an issue, especially when viewing dark things on the screen and there is bright ambient. However it is still useable under these conditions.\n\nThe hinges are solid, with little screen wobble when typing but it does require two hands to open the lid. The look and feel of the laptop is very nice with smooth rounded outer edges.\n\n**4. Performance and heat:**\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 258v is perfectly capable of handling my usual tasks of multiple Chrome/ Firefox tabs, connecting to my remote desktop for work and steaming video content.  I have tried some gaming and the experience with casual  games has been very good. Fortnite runs at 120FPS. Cities Skylines runs great. I’ve tried playing Watchdogs and although it could play it, the framerates were only around 40fps and the processor got quite hot with the fans getting noisy.\n\nThe keyboard and palm rest areas are always cool. The area under the screen gets warm under load but the hot air is blown out through the vents on the back, away from the user which is a good design.\n\n**5. Audio and Webcam:**\n\nThe speakers are fine, they are up firing from the sides of the keyboard and they are rated for Dolby Atmos. I can clearly hear the 3D effects when watching YouTube or Netflix. There isn't much bass but it is acceptable for a thin and light laptop.\n\nThe 5M IR camera is decent for video conferencing. There is a privacy shutter switch just above the camera. Windows Hello usually takes just a few seconds to log me in. I have found the fingerprint scanner works faster, especially when the lighting conditions are not ideal for Windows Hello.\n\n**6. Battery Life:**\n\nThe 70WHr battery lasts all day for me when web browsing/ streaming videos. I use a 100W Ugreen 4-port USB C charger to charge all my devices and the laptop fully charges within a couple of hours.  \n\n**7. Software and User Experience:**\n\nThe OS is Windows 11 Home 64 and comes with some minor bloatware including McAffee Antivirus, Lenovo support/ vantage/ AI shenanigans. The Lenovo Vantage software has some useful features including dimming various parts of the screen to save battery – I only use the taskbar dimming though as I find the background dimming too distracting. It also enables you to switch the laptop on just by lifting the lid, which means the much maligned side power switch is hardly ever used. There have been reports of this power button breaking easily on other models and thus bricking the device.\n\n**8. Price and Value:**\n\nThe base model costs £1000 (£900 for students or those that qualify for VIP member) and comes with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and a14inch WUXGA OLED screen (1920x1200, 400nits, 60Hz). I was happy to pay the \\~£200 premium for the better spec’d screen with double the RAM and SSD. Mine came with a 65W USB-C charger and a stylus pen which magnetically attaches to the lid.\n\n**9. Pros and Cons:**\n\n* **Pros:** Screen, performance, battery life, keyboard\n* **Cons:** Screen reflections, power key positioning.\n\n**10. Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a well-built laptop where the pros far out-weigh the cons. The OLED screen is fantastic and it has been a pleasure watching content in a darkened room. It is very easy to travel with, having all-day battery life and a thin and light form factor.\n\n**Final Rating:** 9/10",
  "Really nice post.\n\nIm looking into this as pretty much the only option as the price is really good compared to others.\n\nIm sceptical about the hinges, but you say they are fine. And also if the performance is okay, if i could spec it id go higher but there arent really any options. \n\nThe next thing is vivobook which goes about 50% more with worse screen",
  "How about the weight, does it feel heavy...do you think it's worth the penny and do you think it's a good investment until 2028 atleast?",
  "Im setting up my 16 inch model right now and the fans are running on low constantly and high pitch too, did yours do the same?",
  "Hey, I am curious how did you opt for the fingerprint scanner. I can't find it in the configurations. Thanks.",

  "Hi OP, I read a few other reddit posts regarding poor battery life on this particular screen option (2.8K) compared to alot of the youtube reviews (which seems to be based on the 1200 screen option). When you say all day do you mean \\~7 hours? Are you leaving your screen on 120Hz or reducing it to 60Hz.",
  "Hi, I’ve used a Lenovo Yoga 7 AMD from a few generations back with the Ryzen 6800U for the past 3 years and have had no issues with the hinges for what it’s worth!",
  "Thanks. Only time will tell regarding the hinges but they look and feel sturdy to me and these double hinge designs should in theory spread the force out across the 4 contact points on each hinge, reducing the stress at any one point. I'll update if I have any problems with the hinges",
  "It doesn't feel heavy but it's not feather-light like the LG gram. The LG gram can be lifted from a corner with one hand easily whereas I'd struggle to do this with the Yoga 7i. The Yoga 7i   feels more substantial, more premium. However it is still easy to carry around in a back pack.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase so far - it does everything I need and I feel it is good value for what you get compared to an equivalent from HP or Apple. As long as I keep the battery in good condition and the hinges don't break, I'm sure it'll last a good 3-5 years. \n\nIf I didn't play PC games, I would have strongly considered a macbook air 13\".",
  "The 14 inch model doesn't have this problem at all. It's mostly silent. Your 16 inch model should have even better thermal handling given the extra space. The constant fans might be due to all the updates being installed, see how it goes",

The UK lenovo website states which gen it is,  the i is for Intel, they usually have AMD in brackets for AMD models. X means snapdragon. I think the gen 10s are sometimes called Aura Edition too",
  "1. The HDMI port is a standard sized 1.4b\n\n2. The SSD can be upgraded via the M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe SSD slot but that's about it. The RAM is soldered on the model I got.",
  "There is a black border around the screen but the glass extends over it. The border houses the web cam",
  "I turned off the side power button and activated the open screen to switch on option which works really well. It means I never accidentally mis-press the power button and it should last a lot longer",
  " battery life has been fine for me, I've kept it at 120Hz and only charge up to 80%. Off power, I've been using it for 5 hours now, browsing/ streaming at 50% screen brightness and there's still 45% remaining, so that's just 35% battery use after 5 hours of light usage. I would expect at least 12 hours from a fully charged battery",
  "So pc games work on this one? How is the performance, which games did you try out and does it heat up?",
  "Do you still see that option? Cause I don't see it when I want to configure it",
  "Interesting... Yea the Canadian site doesn't mention generation. We have all those versions though.",
  "yea the cpu and size are all included in the full model name, but aura edition stands for the optimized intel partnerships versions that have slightly better battery life and perfs",
  "Is it possible to replace the keyboard?",
  "Awesome. Thank you ",
  "[removed]",
  "Whats the thought behind charging to 80% - does this extend overall battery life long-term?",
  "Yes, you can play PC games. Fortnite runs at 100-120FPS on the native screen resolution. Cities Skylines plays well.  I wouldn't expect to be able to run the latest AAA 3D intensive games well, but it can run most of them on low settings but I wouldn't recommend it for that as the fan noise gets quite loud if pushed too hard.",
  "Yes, it's still there as an option on the Lenovo UK website for the Lenovo Yoga 7i",
  "You would have to replace the entire assembly including touchpad",
  "I've used the laptop for a few months now and on the rare occasion that I do need to use the side power button (maybe twice so far), it's worked as it should. I think if the usage of the power button is so low, it should easily last the entire life of the laptop",
  "Yes, it's an option in the power management software to prolong battery health. It's standard practice for all lithium batteries",
  "Lenovo Yoga pro 7 i’m thinking of pulling the plug and buying the lenovo yoga pro 7. it’s for college and it kind of fits all my needs. i can get it for around $1200 cad and i don’t really know if it’s a good deal. Could i get something better for the same price or less or a bit more expensive? please let me know ",
  "Yoga Pros are solid ultrabooks, but whether it’s good for you depends on the exact specs of the laptop and what you are studying/doing/gaming/working on.\n\nwhat’s your field of study at uni? some degrees will require specific hardware, such as a graphics card, and not all of the Yoga Pro models have discrete GPUs which brings up the earlier question about specs.",
  "It's a bit heavy for my tastes at over 3.5 lbs, but it seems like a decently compact powerhouse.\n\nAnother system to consider is the Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition. It's an Intel Lunar Lake machine, about 2.75 lbs, Arc graphics, up to 32 GB of RAM. It's cheaper, and would have a better battery life, but the Arc graphics are slower than the 3050.",
  "mechanical engineering. i do plan to get a desktop with a better gpu in the future but the yoga pro 7 has a ryzen 7 8845hs and 3050",
  "i have been looking at that but it’s pretty much out of stock everywhere i’ve looked. i would get the 4060 of the pro 7 but i can’t find it either",
  "that configuration should be enough for your degree. it’s very unlikely you’ll need more than the 3050 for your undergrad.",
  "Can't help you there. It was in stock on Lenovo.com, but that's pricey. I got mine new on ebay with the full manufacturer warranty for $799 (256V model)",
  "okay that’s good. i see so much 3050 hate online so i thought it wasn’t really worth it😅",
  "well, it’s objectively an underpowered and limited discrete card. the hate is warranted, especially for the desktop variants which are extremely poor performance for the price you pay. **it’s a terrible option if your goal is to play video games**. \n\nits use case is different for laptops and students. for what the 3050 lacks in performance, it makes up for in being a very efficient card that draws very little power. in a laptop, you don’t necessarily want a powerful, power-hungry card that heats up like crazy and drains the battery life in 5 seconds. all laptop card variants are much worse than their desktop counterparts, anyways.\n\nfor you specifically, having a discrete GPU at all is largely beneficial for CAD software and other modeling software. sometimes, these softwares require a discrete GPU to even function properly. \n\na laptop is where a 3050 probably shines brightest. for more context, the 3050 is one of the few relatively modern cards that has a model without a power cable. there’s a low-profile desktop GPU 3050 that draws a max of only 50W and is powered solely through the PCIe connector. cool stuff.",
  "that does make a lot of sense. thanks for the clarification, i mainly wanted something with a dgpu but most laptops with them are heavy and loud",
  "slight update. i just found an omen 14 with an ultra 7 155h and a 4060 for $1300 and i might be going with that because it literally better in every way?",
  "it is a much higher performing laptop for sure in every aspect. like I said, the Yoga Pro is enough for your degree, but the Omen 14 is a gaming laptop and you could legitimately use it to game in many modern titles as well.",
  "okay thanks for the clarification. i might as well get the omen then but ive heard the battery is terrible",
  "it’s a gaming laptop with a powerful CPU. the H model Intel Ultra chips have more cores and faster clock speeds which draws significantly more power. once again, the Yoga Pro is better for battery life and it’s more than enough for your studies, but the Omen is a powerful gaming laptop. its first and foremost built for gaming, which you will never do on battery anyways.",
  "Laptop comparison: Zenbook14 (amd) vs Yoga slim 7 intel vs Yoga slim 7 gen 10(amd) I just graduated and am planning on buying my second laptop. I am considering either a ZenBook from Asus or Yoga from Lenovo. I will probably receive a work laptop so I need a laptop for normal browsing, maybe upskilling, movies and I play Genshin Impact consistently. once in a while i might play valorant, basically light gaming. I would prefer a 16GB RAM and 1TB storage. 512GB is also fine if other features are good. looking for a laptop with OLED Screen.\n\nI have 3 options that I really like:\n\n**1. ZenBook 14 OLED(2025) :  89,990 Rs**  \n[ZenBook 14 OLED](https://in.store.asus.com/ai-powered-light-weight-laptop-asus-zenbook-14-um3406ka-pp240ws.html)\n\nI really like this laptop and wanted a ZenBook for quite some time. I love everything about this laptop - the color, build, display quality. The amd version of this was released in India a few days ago. It has Ryzen AI 5 340 Processor which i know is quite good. Only downside is its 1TB Version is not yet available in India and I am not sure if it will be released any time soon too. I will have to pay extra for warranty too.\n\n**2. Yoga Slim 7 Gen 10 - AMD AI : 81,275 Rs**  \n[Lenovo Yoga slim 7 Gen 10](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-s-series/lenovo-yoga-slim-7-gen-10-14-inch-amd/83jycto1wwin1)\n\nThis also comes with Ryzen AI 5 340 Processor same as ZenBook. But the display of this laptop is not as good as ZenBook. looks wise i like ZenBook more but this is pretty good too. If i customize this laptop then the cost increases as:\n\n* \\+4000Rs Warranties that are automatically added \n* \\+2000Rs Microsoft office extra\n* \\+4900Rs for 1TB Storage\n* \\+4200Rs for Ryzen AI 7 350\n* \\+3850Rs for *35.56cms (14) 2.8K (2880 x 1800), OLED, Glare, Non-Touch, HDR 1000 True Black, 100%DCI-P3, 1100 nits (HDR Peak)/500 nits (SDR Typical), 120Hz*\n\nThe cost might go upto 93k - 99k depending on the combo. I don't know if Lenovo custom laptops are good cause one of my friends told me something negative about them.\n\nThese 2 are my top options.\n\n**3.** **Yoga Slim 7 Intel, 35.56cms - Core Ultra 5: 79,491 Rs**  \n[Yoga slim 7 Intel Ultra Core](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-s-series/yoga-slim-7i-gen-9-14-inch-intel/83cv008lin)\n\nThe intel version of the 2nd laptop. I was planning on going with amd but this laptop looked pretty good. This one has Ultra 5 125H Processor and its 1TB. I can customize it to Ultra 7 155H processor for extra 15k but then i have to pay extra for warranties and Microsoft Office too. Total would come around 97k.\n\nThese 3 are my major options. Should i consider Ideapads or vivobooks? Please help me with it.",

  "Am I about to make a mistake?

Cannot for the life of me find a single review directly of this model. Or a related one with different specs. It's all Slims and 2-in-1s. \n\n\nWHY AM I LOOKING AT IT?\nNot for gaming, other than maybe a light cozy thing here or there. It's so I can do office type and browsing functions while I am on the move and potentially some light music production. \n\n\nThin and light would be good. Want to be able to carry it around without hassle. \n\n\nNeed a good battery life but not insane. 8 hours would be fine. Sales tech said this would get at least 10. I'd reduce the refresh rate to 60hz, I won't need 120 most of the time. Presumably that'll eek more time out. \n\n\nBest I can tell CPU should be pretty future proofed. Seems basically as good as it gets for this category. \n\n\nRAM is confirmed by sales tech as dual channel. Unfortunately there doesn't seem an option to do 64gb instead which would give me future proofing comfort. \n\nBut as far as I can tell the RAM (LPDDR5X-8533MT/s) is basically top of the line for portable laptops. \n\n\nWHAT AM I WORRIED ABOUT?\nMain thing keeping me from pulling the trigger is glossy screen as I like bright rooms and sitting outside haha but... seems like nearly all of then have that. I assume I can maybe put a screen film over it of some kind? \n\n\nSecond thing is overheat potential. Without reviews on this specific configuration, seems a risk the ultra 9 285H might get SPICY. I presume I can maybe manage this by reducing power in the settings...",
  "Idk about this model specifically as I'm researching a 2in1 to purchase, why are all the Lenovo 2 in 1's so much more expensive than their pro counterparts?? My local retailers won't even stock them as their price is just absurd.\n\nAlso, because these brands make multiple laptops of the same format with different specs, usually have to look at them as a whole, then the changed specs individually. Look for reviews on the yoga/yoga pro (compared to other brands, some great reviews and minimal complaints), then make sure the cpu is good.",
  "Hmmm. Interesting. What region are you in? I'm in Victoria Australia and here it seems like the 2 in 1s are pretty affordable, they just use the less heavy duty specs (Vs instead of Hs). \n\n\nBut yeh that's kind of what I've had to make do with RE reviews. Kind of gettins the vibe of similar names and judhing it off that. My exact thoughts on it. The complexity of the seemingly similar but not quite same laptop models with different nearly the same name and completely different specs has made the review space completely fucked to navigate hahaha.",
  "Im in QLD, I should have clarified for the same specs, the 2in1's are more expensive. Currently I'm trying to find specs for a version JB hifi sell but Lenovo have removed completely from their website. Of course they do that and JB don't specify.",
  "To be fair JBs laptop prices are uniformly atrocious hahaha. They charge amounts for specs that are several tiers below what that price point should provide. I think their target market is mostly people who know nothing about computers haha",
  "That's true, but jb for at least one of the models is the exact same price as Lenovo website, without the 3-5 week wait.",
  "Yeh they sometimes might be ok generally, but i notice A lot of the lenovo website prices themselves are inflated. \nLike the one I posted is apparently 40% off, as are other ones im considering which are slightly less speccy, full price of 3.2k or so. But the literal same laptop at a retailer like HN or Office Works is like 2.3k full price. \nSo lenovo website on sale is a genuine sale price but not on sale they're wildly expensive.",

  "Torn between HP OmniBook X Flip and Lenovo Yoga 7i - Both have major flaws at $799 I've been researching 16\" 2-in-1s and honestly both options at this price point are disappointing. The HP OmniBook X Flip has that \"lattice-less\" keyboard design that's getting roasted everywhere - PCWorld and Tom's Hardware both called it out for being way too flat, and people keep hitting wrong keys even after getting used to it. Plus if you upgrade to the OLED version, you're looking at 60-70% worse battery life and burn-in risks if you use photo editing software with static UI elements. The Lenovo Yoga 7i avoids the keyboard issue, but the base IPS display is dim at only \\~297 nits with poor color coverage.\n\nHere's my real problem: Lenovo offers OLED on the Yoga 7i but NOT at the sub-$1300 price point, which feels like a deal killer when you're trying to get a decent display for creative work. The base screen is just too dim and washed out. I'm stuck choosing between a laptop with a terrible keyboard or one with a terrible screen, and honestly neither feels like a win. \n\nAnyone has experience with both the 2 in 1 laptops please guide.",
  "I have the omnibook X flip 16, core ultra 7, 32g ram, 2tb HDD 2k screen, and it's a killer laptop. Build quality is awesome, runs great, fast, no issues so far. I have it plugged into a thunderbolt dock with dual monitors and external mouse and kb all day so my use case is different than yours but I'm extremely happy with this laptop. And it's all metal case is super solid. I started with the Asus 3k OLED zenbookS or whatever and had all kinds of issues with it and the OLED screen wasn't worth the price in my eyes. I know hp gets flack and I'm sure their cheapo laptops are subpar but the last two (omnibook X flip and spectre) have been some of my favorite laptops I've owned.",
  "The Omnibook X Flip 16\" is like $429 at BestBuy right now.",

[Thurrott](https://www.thurrott.com/mobile/copilot-pc/323971/hp-omnibook-x-flip-16-review) for example had no real complaints with the keyboard on the OmniBook.\n\nFor your use cases, a quality screen should be a bigger priority. As the Lenovo doesn't have an OLED option at your price point, that should rule it out. Granted neither is really geared specifically towards photo editing (photo editing would be utilizing the AdobeRGB colorspace, which neither has full coverage of. Digital video is what DCI-P3 is targeted at).\n\nBrightness is a secondary if not tertiary concern to color gamut and quality of the out of the box color calibration, especially if the system does not support recalibration of the display via a color calibrator.",

To me, the build quality and keyboard felt better and the battery life was greater enough to matter. I'm using it mostly for work when mobile, and so the OLED doesn't constitute a major advantage for me; but I can see a case for it. \n\nThe 9i Yoga with the 3K OLED and 32GB RAM in that sleek blue finish is maybe the finest piece of laptop kit I've ever handled, but it was overkill for what I needed by a lot.",

I am taking art classes and a touch screen laptop would be great. If this, the Yoga, is junk, what else should I look at? Thought about Samsung, but I'm also rather unfamiliar with those too.

Unfortunately, I'm limited to BestBuy and ThinkPads are out of my price range, otherwise I'd just get one of those and deal with the mouse drawing. I'm glad to hear that you've had a good overall experience with the brand though; I'll definitely keep this in mind when I finally make a decision.",
  "Do the hinges seem pretty good? ",
  "Ah, alright. Do you think it would be a reasonable idea to get a tablet for drawing, and a non-touchscreen laptop (only reason I've been looking at touchscreens is for the drawing, I don't care about them otherwise) for assignments and such? \n\n\nEither way, do you have any suggestions on what I should get?",
  "I am from France, so customer protection is pretty important here, btw I have a Lenovo ideapad pro 5 gen 9 (780€, oled, 2.8k, 84Wh, 32go ram, amd ryzen 7 8845hs, 1.5kg, full aluminium), I compared mine with some yoga I say in shop and even thought yoga should be higher quality, my ideapad pro feel better in quality (I suspect that is because it’s a Chinese version product = \"xiaoxin\" coz Chinese version generally have a higher quality and lower price)",
  "yes smooth action can initially open with one finger then use 2 to open fully",
  "Used to think the same for touchscreen that I needed it but actually I don’t, but here you’re drawing which I don’t do a lot. You can try a drawing pad.\n\nAnyways, i don’t know much about 2in1s, i only know bad models.",
  "Wish I could say the same about America and customer protection; I've had some pretty bad customer service experiences with pretty much every laptop brand out there, and they usually want me to pay more money, even with a warranty, to get a fix. Wish prices weren't so crazy here too. Feels like I'm spinning in circles just to find something I can afford that I'll be happy with.\n\nI've definitely heard better about the ideaPad pro build quality, so your statement makes sense. The ideapad that I had, and returned, wasn't a pro, and the casing was plastic and felt very cheap tbh. Perhaps I'll just steer clear of anything with a plastic case and see where that gets me.",
  "Oooh, I forgot about drawing pads. Haven't used those since like.. middle school. I'll consider getting one of those and picking a laptop with good build quality. Thanks for your input.",
  "What, US have the best price eve… wait a minute, since the 🍊 head became president did he impose tariff here? Then again, my DREAM laptop cost 2000€ in France and it’s 1100$ in America, the G14 ASUS zephyrus, did price hike by a lot? \n\nAnd yeah aluminum for the win, another good business laptop is ASUS zenbook, some like it (like me) other don’t (coz the material feel plastic and it’s way to light) search some video about it, it’s one of the most esthetic one for me lol, price should be low in the US.\n\nIdk if u have huawei laptop in the us since apple got scared of huawei, but they have some VERY good looking, high quality, good specs one for extremely low price even in France where price are HIGH, it’s only 550€.\n\nAnother brand is Samsung, some are great, some are expensive, it’s also extremely light and have a phone glass like panels",
  "I'm kinda on a tight budget so I'm probably a bit biased when it comes to my definition of \"crazy prices,\" but from what I've seen, it does appear that tech prices in general have jumped if they are imported in some way. Don't completely take my word on that tho, that was only like 30min of reading stuff online. Not surprising if it's true, it's a dumpster fire over here right now.\n\nNo easy access to huawei that I know of, over here; looks like ebay would be the best option for getting one. I've never heard of them before your comment, so definitely not common over here as far as I'm aware.\n\nThanks for the other suggestions and commentary about them. I'll take a look at the zenbook and Samsung - I was considering getting a Samsung galaxy book 360 when it was on sale but I took too long trying to decide, since I know almost nothing about them as a brand, and then it went offsale lol.",

Cannot for the life of me find a single review directly of this model. Or a related one with different specs. It's all Slims and 2-in-1s. \n\n\nNot for gaming, other than maybe a light cozy thing here or there. It's so I can do office type and browsing functions while I am on the move and potentially some light music production. \n\n\nThin and light would be good. Want to be able to carry it around without hassle. \n\n\nNeed a good battery life but not insane. 8 hours would be fine. Sales tech said this would get at least 10. I'd reduce the refresh rate to 60hz, I won't need 120 most of the time. \n\n\nBest I can tell CPU should be pretty future proofed. Seems basically as good as it gets for this category. \n\n\nRAM is confirmed by sales tech as dual channel. Unfortunately there doesn't seem an option to do 64gb instead which would give me future proofing comfort. \n\nBut as far as I can tell the RAM (LPDDR5X-8533MT/s) is basically top of the line for portable laptops. \n\n\n\nMain thing keeping me from pulling the trigger is glossy screen as I like bright rooms and sitting outside haha but... seems like nearly all of then have that. I assume I can maybe put a screen film over it of some kind? ",

  "Lenovo yoga 7 14inch 2 in 1, amd ryzen ai 7 350, oled 2.8k screen, 32gb and 1tbssd gen 10 I ended up purchasing this laptop in the end, I tried to cancel the order but it was already on a plane flying over to the UK from China which by the way was the quickest delievery ever, sailed through customs within a few hours and was at my door step within 2 days. Highly reccomend Lenovo UK website to order. \n\nAnyway, the laptop is better than I thought, I'm a student so that will be my sole purpose of use, I have a phone to watch ny yt videos and stuff, I just need Microsoft 365 and Google for research. \n\nWarning: it really isn't a gaming laptop from what I can tell, however you can still play but I don't think you will get the most out of the games. \n\nPossitives:\nThe screen is beautiful 😍  I paid extra for the 2.8k oled and it was worth it, crisp, sharp, colourful and overall vibrant. \n\nIt's a touch screen, using my fingers is smooth, you can adjust the settings for touch sensitivity which I did, it's responsive, smooth and quick. I'm not sure about the pen I'll mention that in the negatives. \n\nThe sound is beautiful, it's louder, and alot clear compared to my previous laptop. No issues with sound and comes from both sides of laptop which is good. \n\nMakes zero noise, since I got it and I've put the updates on, which was super quick by the way, but it's silent. Probably no sound or if there is a sound I cannot hear it. I can hear a fan it's pretty peaceful. \n\nCharges super quick.\n\nPen charges super quick and battery lasts a few days depending on use. \n\nI've used the laptop all day working and researching and it's smooth, handles the workload well, and hasn't heat up like my older laptop which heat up and made a bit of noise when the workload got heavy. \n\nThe battery has last me from 5pm Thursday to 10pm Friday night. I'm happy with this, I was constantly updating, and doing my studies so it definitely holds up good. \n\nYou can remove the ai features which I did. \n\nSimple setup \n\nLooks beautiful especially in Tidal Teal\n\n14inch is big enough for carrying around. The 16 inch is similar in price but I personally found it too big and heavy the 14 inch is the right weight and perfect screen size. And honestly the 16 inch in general is far too big to carry around unless you plan to keep it in one place. \n\nNegatives: \nThe hinges don't seem strong. I hate to say this. It's a shame but I will probably not be using tablet mode, although when placed in tablet and tent mode it's still smooth and works great. But the hinges are a bit concerning. When in laptop mode the screen wobbles a bit too much. So yeah those hinges are a concern... \n\nRyzen ai 7 350 is meh. It's still fast and smooth but it's definitely not as amazing as I thought. I would reccomend the intel version over the amd ai. But it's still a good laptop for school work \n\nThe pen is not as sensitive as the finger, they send the new release yoga pen with the laptop and it isn't the best. Better off getting another type of pen.\n\nThe slot for the memory card looks concerning, I have not tried it yet but I'm not sure if I will..doesn't look like it will ever come back out. \n\nYou'll forever be cleaning the laptop no matter how much you wash your hands and they are clean this laptop is a magnetic for finger prints, the keyboard too. The touchscreen isn't that bad I've not had to clean it much. \n\nOverall I reccomend this laptop to students \n\n",
  "Hi , thank you very much for this review, I'm looking into buying the exact same model , but I have a few doubts could you please clarify them \n\nU mentioned this is a touchscreen \nThe same model i found: [here on lenovo ](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-pro-series/lenovo-yoga-pro-7-gen-10-14-inch-amd/83kgcto1wwin1?cid=in:sem:218hlv&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22385956031&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxo_CBhDbARIsADWpDH7jP6TxR9xBBmBMBMnYZi8RqzEZzOIFA1zIGyXw4jR5ZWVppoYqErsaAlw9EALw_wcB) \n\nSays it isn't touchscreen, can u confirm both are the same models \n\nI do not game , my use case for laptop is dev and design (figma and davinci resolve) , so do u still recommend this laptop?\n\nThis is costing me 725 pounds due to corporate discounts , is this a steal?",
  "Hi all, sorry if I haven't replied ive been busy with work and school work, \n\nJust an update, my laptop refuses to update, and the screen freezes consistently and doesnt save my work after, its always a reboot job, the track pad doesnt recognise my finger sometimes and lags sometimes the pointer goes missing on the screen and then... freezes all after a few updates. Before the update laptop was good. \n\nI would not recommend this for gaming and work in general it struggles to deal with basics. \n\nWhen laptop lid is closed it doesnt save anything, it will turn everything off ive changed setting etc and still doesnt just standy. \n\nUpdate seems to have left out important bits because new update refuses to download and says error. \n\nBeautiful looking laptop but not functional.",

  "Thanks for sharing. I recently bought a Lenovo yoga 7 2-in-1 touchscreen laptop too. I was hesitant since I’ve heard the hinges might become a problem in the future. I’m going to use it pretty much only for school so tablet mode is not too necessary",
  "Hi, what is your conclusion after a few months with this laptop, would you still recommend it? I'm considering buying it for school however I want to make sure im not disappointed. Thanks!",
  "I had an awful experience with this laptop (Yoga 7 14\" 2-in-1, 14AKP10). The sound drivers were so bad that even three OS reinstalls and a BIOS update didn't help. There were some AMD/Realtek sound issues that couldn't be fixed at the time (maybe because the CPU was brand new, or for some other reasons). The sound from the laptop's speakers was laggy. I tried all the suggestions from Reddit and other relevant websites and decided to return the laptop after a few days.",

And I would have got it in silver the Tidal Teal shows the finger prints too blatantly no matter how much you wash your hands and clean the laptop. \n\nIf you're using the laptop for heavy professional stuff like editing gaming definitely upgrade... for light work like browsing and Microsoft 365 etc get the 350",
  "Yeah, seems like it. It seems safe using it as a laptop though but I wouldn't use it as a tablet just seems too fragile.",
  "Leneovo UK website . I'm in the UK",
  "Honestly, with the price point you can get a better spec, this laptop has its issues or \"teething problems\" yes it looks pretty, vibrant and colourful but it can lack in the performance, for example it freezes a lot when in tablet mode, the side buttons turn the laptop off when accidently pressed, the pen is not that great, the pen also leaves a lot of marks on the laptop screen which is hard to get off, almost like faint scratches, but the pen in general does not respond well to laptop and is not smooth, the laptop mouse or trackpad freezes, although the recent update did fix this, but ill be honest the tent mode and tablet mode freezes a lot, not sure why. \n\nThe hinges look weak! However not broken so far so cant be as bad as they look \n\nThe laptop for the price is not worth it and I recall somebody on here telling me to get a better spec but I didnt listen and I wish I did. \n\nThe web cam is terrible too almost like sometjing from the year 2000\n\nBattery life is terrible even in the power saver mode its awful lasts me around 4 hours maybe 5 when in heavy use my Dell lasted me 8 hours straight. This laptop needs charging often \n\n\nThe positives are I managed to turn AI features off besides a few which is great! \n\nThe 14inch is a godsend its perfect!!! If you plan to use it as a tablet or tent mode do not get anything bigger it will just feel and look awful and chunky \n\nThe laptop is slim in design looks sleek. \n\nBattery charges super quick like very quick the first charge I did up to 100 and then after that I set it to 80 to protect the battery life spam and it makes no difference either way it needs charging after 4 or 5 hours or heavy use. \n\nIts bright, the display is gorgeous 😍 \n\nIf I could return it and choose another I would opt for a thinkpad and opt for specs, performance over looks and the tablet mode gimmick \n\nHave a look after to see if there are better specs for the similar price range and ask ppl on reddit who know about laptops they gave me good advice which I didnt lsiten to much",

  "I would get it in intel if you're thinking about it and also if you really want amd go for ryzen 9 ai 370 if you can get it",
  "I can't answer that. A device is only worth what you're willing to pay",
  "It even feels slow for it's specs",
  "Thanks, but I have somewhat bad prior experience with Intel (typing this now on a Yoga 7 with Intel 1260p) and their integrated graphics, especially on Linux. AMD on the other hand works like a dream, and Linux support for AMDGPU is the best of the bunch by far. That's why your laptop is exactly what I was looking for. And yes, getting a HX370 is next to impossible now. I guess AMD has really low yields with 300 series and all 370s and above end up in high-end devices with dedicated graphics (like ProArt and Zephyrus) - which doesn't make sense as 890M is already a really powerful GPU. But given no desktop-replacement GPUs from AMD right now (no 9000 mobile series yet) it seems the high-end gaming will be stealing our AMD CPU supply for some time to come.",
  "Yes ofc. You said you felt it wasn't worth the price. So I was wondering how much you spent on it",
  "Yep unfortunately I went for a 2 in 1 and lenovo focused on looks over anything else",
  "That's really interesting,  im a big fan of amd and and dont think I've ever used an intel except for at work maybe, but this is the only laptop I found intel runs so smoothly and is probs a bit better and for the life of me I cant figure out why. \n\nIt does do the job though, I only use it for research and Microsoft 360 light browsing so it fits me needs don't think its good enough as a gaming laptop",
  "I paid £995 when first released \n\nYou can get a better spec with this price",

  "Hp omen max with 5080 or Lenovo legion pro 7 with 5070ti Pretty much the same price on black Friday deals.

Build quality, experience with one or both, or just opinions would be welcomed",
  "Tough one the 16 go of vram vs 12 on the legion but I would compare the cpu and screens. Do you have the details?  Not all  hp omen max come with oled screens, so that’s a plus for the legion. Plus the legion typically uses the faster ddr5-6400 ram.  I have a legion pro 5 and have been really happy and typically online reviewers prefer the legions over hp.  Is there a store you can go look at em? The touch of the keyboard or track pad might be an instant no go.",
  "Yeah I realized after posting this that the omen doesn’t have the oled screen. Got caught spec chasing and didn’t realize. Now I’m trying to decide whether to get the 5070ti legion with intel i9 or 5080 with amd 9950hdx",

Istg the only deciding factor here is the price, I could get the Lenovo for much cheaper but am I gonna pay for choosing the cheaper option long term?",
  "Ok so come back I just found a better version of the Lenovo with 32gb of Ram and 1tb storage so now I really don’t know",
  "I’ve heard people say the Unix terminal is better but hardware wise the Lenovo is giving me 32gb ram and 1tb ssd which is double the M4’s (16/512)  and the Lenovo costs less so now I’m really f’ing confused",
  "Okay I'm a CS grad as well, with industry and research experience so let me give you my opinion on this. \n\nThe nix shell or the posix shell is better yes and you'll be better suited with it, but considering budget and pragmatism,  you can also use windows subsystem for linux or wsl. So right now, the main deciding factor for you should be which os you're more comfortable with? Hardware specs are one thing but if you have to sacrifice years of workflow and familiarity it's not worth switching. So if you're on Windows now, stay on Windows. If you've been on macOS, stay on macOS. \n\nAnd obviously cost is a no brainer. If you want more bang for the buck and the Windows machine does your job, why not? \n\nP.S. - 32 GB should make it a breeze to run WSL as the underlying VM takes up about 4GB and you can shut it down when you don't need it. (Automatically shuts down after a while of inactivity)",
  "Thanks for the advice but I think I’ll switch to MacOS because I used my brother’s MB Air a few times and it was the best laptop experience I had and I think I also want to explore other options apart from Windows. I’ll only be using it for 4 years then after graduation I’ll return home where I can build a desktop with better specs!",

  "Lenovo Yoga 7 Pro vs Asus Zenbook 14 OR Lenovo Yoga 2 in 1 vs Zenbook S14 Hi, so I am looking for a premium thin and light powerful laptop with great battery life in the premium segment. I have shortlisted to 2 categories and 4 laptops which I have mentioned in the title.\nHere are some basic configurations :-\n1) Lenovo Yoga 7 Pro \n- Intel core ultra 9 285H\n- 3K Oled display\n- Intel arc 140T graphics card\n- 32GB RAM / 1TB SSD \n- Aura édition 8853 MT/s\n- Touch\n\n2) Asus Zenbook 14\n- Intel core ultra 9 285H\n- 3K Oled display\n- Intel arc 140T graphics card\n- 32GB RAM / 1TB SSD\n- Normal édition and less than 8853 MT/s\n- Touch and stylus support\n\n-> 3) & 4) Both have Intel core ultra 7 258V processor which I'm worried won't be sufficient for tasks such as light gaming even. \n\nPlease provide your valid inputs with your reviews and also I would consider yoga 7 Pro but it comes in a single color which I found a little bit unsatisfactory than the zenbook's looks.\nInputs are welcome! Thanks\n\nP.S. - I am going to buy the laptop tomorrow so I need quick suggestions please.",
  "I have the Zenbook 14 (mine has the 1920x1200 OLED, otherwise specs as you listed) and would definitely recommend it. In mixed use (some Youtube, web browsing, a couple hours playing 9 Kings) I've been getting 8-9 hours of screen on time out of the battery, and performance has been excellent. Battery might be slightly better or worse on Windows (I am using Debian Linux), but for the performance I think that much battery life is still mindblowing. The hardware is 100% a premium device. If I could do it over, I would buy this laptop again.",
  "Damn, but didnt you consider yoga 7 Pro cuz it has better features otherwise",
  "Been looking everywhere for someone who has this OLED! The 3k doesn’t appear to be available in the UK. Do you have the reported issues with seeing dots on the digital layer for the touch screen? Do you do a lot of reading and typing as supposedly it’s not great for that either?\nFinally, how is wifi 7 card?\nThank you",
  "I did not. The Yoga 7 Pro doesn't appear to be readily available in the US (where I live) in anything close to the spec you listed, so that takes it out of the running for me. I did find a listing for $200 more than I paid for the Zenbook, which doesn't inspire me much. Are the prices for the two similar where you are?",
  "> Do you have the reported issues with seeing dots on the digital layer for the touch screen?\n\nI don't; however, those seem to be reported by people who view a lot of white backgrounds. I just checked out a white background myself to try to look for it and I *think* I saw a little of it on a fully white screen, but frankly the sheer amount of white light was far more offensive than any pattern that may or may not have been there. With anything not majority pure-white I can pretty confidently say it's not an issue.\n\n> Do you do a lot of reading and typing as supposedly it’s not great for that either? \n\nNot sure how a screen would be bad for typing, personally - if this is re: the keyboard, I have found it to be very solid as far as laptop keyboards go. Primary use case for this for me is as a web browsing machine/capable PC on the go, but it is not my main PC. I have not noticed anything that would lead me to say it's not great for reading, though.\n\n> Finally, how is wifi 7 card?\n\nWorks well, though I can't speak to the Windows-specific aspects of it. No complaints once it was up and running (If you're a Linux user, it wasn't detected by the Debian installer, so I had to use a USB-C-to-Ethernet dongle to get the OS installed; worked fine out of the box once the OS install was complete. If you're a Windows user I am sure it will be perfectly fine out of the box.).\n\nOverall, I'm really happy with this laptop. I bought it as a secondary device as mentioned, but I could happily use it as my main PC (outside of graphically-demanding games) if needed. It's got tons of power in an extremely portable form factor with an excellent screen, which is exactly what I wanted from it.",
  "Well well it's even about a 100$ cheaper here the yoga",
  "Really appreciate you taking the time to reply, thank you.\nI think the reading/typing comment was tied to the screen in the sense of it being suitable for that type of work (coding, desktop publishing etc) vs gaming/entertainment, but I’m satisfied hearing from a real world not review world use case. \n\nI’m probably going to go for ultra 7 rather than 9 - my use case won’t really benefit from the extra power when the trade off for the power is slightly less battery time , and more heat and subsequent fan noise. \n\nThat conclusion is also formed from reviews though, so if you’ve an opinion on that I’m all ears! (I will be running Windows)",
  "I may be wrong (going off of the US website as that is where I am based) but it looks like the Ultra 7 variant is the older 155H, whereas if you want the current crop of CPUs the Ultra 9 285H is the only option; from what I was able to find the 155H and 285H get similar battery life, but you get a healthy chunk more performance with the 285H (as you'd hope). If the pricing is similar imo go for the 9. Haven't found heat or noise to really be an issue with this machine anyway (yes the fan can be heard when it's on like any laptop, and yes putting a big fat 16 core CPU into a thin and light chassis like this means the fan will be coming on regularly - that will be the case both with the 155H and the 285H, so I would not consider it a factor in purchase decisions personally). Obviously, if the 155H meets your needs and comes at a decent discount, then it makes sense to go for it.",

  "Air will be much better",
  "I would 100% take the better display, refresh rate, more ram, and more storage, for the cheaper price. If you said a MacBook Pro that's a different story but this Yoga is so much better than a base MacBook Air tbh. Also 512gb of storage is crap and in the Lenovo you can actually upgrade the storage later if needed.",
  "I'm looking at the yoga pro as well! For your use case, could genuinely go either way. Unless you're doing really heavy coding and/or music production, or big multitasking, 16GB of RAM and 512 GB will be sufficient for you, so both will perform relatively well. \n\nIf you want longer battery life, a generally nicer build, better longevity and resale value, and you don't mind some compatibility issues with certain software, using macOS, or paying a bit of a premium, go Macbook.\n\nFor my use case (more heavy spatial analysis work, some editing and music production too) the Yoga is better. Ryzen 7 has slightly better multicore performance than the M4 chip, and the extra 16GB of RAM and double storage is good for heavy tasks. Battery life will of course be much worse than the Air and generally less premium build, but this is minimal so doesn't bother me. It's a tad cheaper at least in Australia, and also has a nicer and bigger screen. \n\nFor your use case I'd think about what you need and go from there. What do you value most? \n\nIf you do decide on the Yoga, the AMD version is cheaper and offers better battery life than the Intel ultra 7 255H, at a slight cost in performance.",
  "I am also planning to buy this. Should I pick the Ryzen or the Intel version? Or should I go for the macbook if I prefer longevity of the laptop?",
  "I like the new intels, personally but prefer the ryzens if the display refresh rate is over 60hz, I play light games so AMDs frame gen is nice.",
  "I prefer battery life here because both AMD and Intel give enough performance for my use cases (software dev, light gaming but not an fps guy)",
