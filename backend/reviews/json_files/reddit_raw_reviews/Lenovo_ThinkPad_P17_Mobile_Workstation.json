  "ThinkPad P14s Gen 4 Intel (14″) Mobile Workstation vs. ThinkPad P14s Gen 4 AMD (14″) Mobile Workstation - Thunder Black Hello. I am new to laptops and would like to know which one is better for an engineering student in terms of performance. I would primarily use this laptop for software like Solidworks CAD and similar. Any recommendation on which is better? Is the AMD Radeon 780m better than the NVIDIA RTX A500? Thank you in advance!",
  "Black Friday buying advice This post is for anyone looking to buy a laptop that is at least 1 tier above trash, with info on CAD, gaming, general use and more. I edit this several times a day.\n\nI have created a subreddit dedicated to helping people with tech. Check it out at r/TOOsTechTactics\n\nPlease go here for updated guide. https://www.reddit.com/r/TOOsTechTactics/s/wMiIvI1fDA\nThis post is a little bit of a mess, and it will not be updated anymore. Seriously, if you see this, go to the updated one.\n\nConsidering how well I feel like this post did, I will create a similar post for next year, hopefully with a more intuitive format and more information. Links to all my favorite experts as well. \n\nThis is an informative post not an English lesson.\n\nTo start, laptops come in a huge variety of types and form factors and sizes and specs. There is a huge market for laptops and many people are overwhelmed with their choices. This post will help you choose a laptop with decent specs, however it will not be indicative of things like build quality and warranty. Let's make a few things very clear right off the bat.\n\n1. Use caution when buying anything online.\n2. Never buy from Temu. Among many reasons for that, Temu is China. Literally just China.\n3. Laptops are expensive. Sorry.\n4. One brand can have great super high end laptops and at the same time try to sell you e-waste like it's a bargain. This is why I cannot recommend certain brands. That's a whole book's worth of information.\n5. There is no perfect universal laptop.\n6. Ask a question I haven't addressed here and if I deem it worthy I will post info about it here.\n7. I want to hear if you got a good laptop based on this post, please and thank you. This is to improve my future posts.\n8. If you are nervous about buying online, try going to a Best Buy. That's an (American Big Box Tech Retailer) tech store. Do be aware that they will try to sell you a computer like a car dealer tries to sell you a car. They will help you. If they don't, well...\n9. If you want to ask anyone for tech advice, you gotta realize that it is work. It's work. There is no secret formula to get you the perfect device.\n10. Specs are one thing, but build quality and actual performance are another. Some laptops will break really easily. Some 5KUSD laptops break easily because they use plastic hinges. Acknowledge that not every tech person has handled and used for 5 years every laptop that has come out of the market. We cannot predict failures such as these. \n11. If you ask me for any advice, take it with this in mind. I will do my best, and I will tell you if something is wildly overpriced, or a scam, or not good enough. However, I would rather you overpay for a great laptop than not have a good enough laptop. \n12. As per expert and enthusiast recommendation, batteries should be replaced around every two years, because all lithium ion batteries will degrade in health and capacity over time. You can alleviate, but in no way prevent this decline by keeping your battery temperature at an acceptable level. Among other things, that is the most simple. Battery replacement can be delayed, but you risk battery expansion (look up spicy pillow syndrome, severe cases can destroy your device, either by chemical or physical means.) and you will live with reduced capacity over time.\n13. If your laptop is slow and clunky, there are some simple things you can do to speed it up yourself. Free things you can do, uninstall programs you do not use, and disable startup programs you do not use. This will free up system resources. You can easily look up how to do this faster than I can type out a reply of: go look it up yourself. You can also clean out your laptop. This is done by opening up your laptop and cleaning away dust and debris. This is especially important with laptops that have a fan intake for cooling. These can get dirty very quickly. The next thing that you can do is shop online for thermal paste. What you can do is you can repaste the chips on your CPU and GPU. The paste I use is Artic MX 4, and it costs around $4-12USD. Very good price. You will find that your computer may already have paste, but it could be old and failing, making your computer overheat. Temperature control is extremely important for computers. You would find it preferable to have your computer reach its maximum performance before it reaches its maximum temperature. You can look up a how to video online to find a step by step video guide on how to repaste your computer. Make sure to include your specific model in your search results. The last thing that you can do, and is also most expensive, is replace your HDD and your RAM. If your laptop has 4GB 8GB of RAM, consider buying an upgrade. Look up your computer model and find the type of RAM it uses. Then buy a lot of comparable RAM that has a higher capacity than what you already have. Don't ask me how to do it, just look it up. If your laptop has a hard drive (HDD), it is likely slowing down your computer a lot. You can purchase a SATA SSD for 20x to 200x faster speeds than HDD. This does not mean your computer will be 20x to 200x faster, but it will surely be a noticeable improvement. This will require purchasing an SATA SSD that matches the size you require, and then also buying a SATA to USB converter. You will then have to download a specialized program to clone your HDD to your SSD. This is a complicated process, but it is worth it for those who want to save a buck. This requires much research and patience. If you don't want to do any of this, or your laptop is simply a potato anyways, then it is time to buy a new laptop. Believe it or not, every laptop has a time where it is wholly inadequate.\n\nWith that out of the way here is information:\n\nAs you read, you will find scattered segments on different topics. Make sure you skim through and make sure something you may want to read about is typed about. \n\nMy friend, if you are wanting to buy a laptop that will last more than 2 years, you will need to spend at least $400USD. Add $100USD for each year. If you are not an experienced buyer, this is a good rule of thumb. Make sure that the laptop can have its battery replaced, as they should be replaced every 2 years.\n\nAs you read this, you will find more information, but this is my general spec advice when purchasing any laptop meant to last at least 2 years and perform optimally.\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5 11th Generation up, Intel Core Ultra 5 up, or Ryzen 5 5600X and up (I am not familiar with Ryzen Processors)\nGPU: (for gamers and professional users) NVIDIA RTX 3070 up.\nRAM: 24GB or more type DDR4 or DDR5 and up. LPDDR is essentially the name for RAM for laptops. \n\nThose are my recommendations for decently spec'd laptop. \n\nCompare two laptops? There is stuff out there. You can test specific parts using UserBenchmark.com or even the whole computer in the same place. Do note that many enthusiasts will stand behind Userbenchmark and others hate it. Alternatives are CPUMark for CPU's, 3DMark for Graphics cards, and Notebookcheck for the more advanced user with the tradeoff of more accurate data.) This only shows data of people testing your exact same computer, it isn't predictive. Take it with a grain of salt. Should not be your primary method of making a purchase decision.\n\nIntel Core i3's are the lowest tier of Intel Core.\nIntel Core i9's are the highest tier, but you don't need an i9 unless you are doing serious heavy lifting with your laptop or any computer.\nAn Intel Core i3 14th Gen can easily beat out a core i9 5th Gen. Generation matters so much when it comes to Intel CPU's.\nIntel Core Ultras are slightly less powerful than Intel Cores, but more efficient. They are also a new technology. \nSnapdragon X or Snapdragon Elite processors are basically really supe'd up mobile phone processors. Very efficient. Still decently powerful. Any Intel Core Ultra or Snapdragon processor is going to be a decent if not great processor. (For those interested in snapdragon processors, please see my segment on it)\nCore Ultra's naming scheme is alot like Intel Core naming scheme. Intel Core Ultra 9 is the most powerful, with Intel Core Ultra 5 being lowest tier (Intel Core i3 is lowest tier for Intel Core Processors). Intel Core Ultra and Intel Core have a difference, but the Ultra in Intel Core Ultra does not mean that they are better than Intel Core. Intel Core Ultra processors are a new type of processor that is less powerful than an Intel Core with the benefit of higher efficiency. It also seems that Intel Core Ultra is to be found with \"AI\" laptops. Intel Core uses more power, but is more powerful. Intel Core Ultra is just a different and newer architecture of processor, but just because it is new does not mean it is inherently better. It is important to note that the Core Ultra Processors manage to have a huge advantage over Intel Core Processors with the sheer efficiency.\nIntel Celeron's are the basic of basic processors. New Celeron's are actually pretty decent, but they are not nearly as good as even an i3. If you see an ad for a Celeron, don't buy unless you want the bare minimum. Just don't. Pentium is slightly better than Celeron, the tier above. Same book as Celeron, just don't. \n\nBelow is some really complex information on the naming scheme of Intel Processors. This can help for fine tuning a decision. You don't have to know this, but it can help. Feel free to scroll past this if you need to.\n\nThe naming schemes of CPU's are created to be as specific as possible, and at a glance an enthusiast can identify the processor, but it is confusing for the general consumer. Let's start with Intel Core Ultra processors.\nLet’s take the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, for example:\nThe ‘Core Ultra’ is the processor’s name.\nThe ‘7’ represents the brand level, indicating the processor’s performance tier. Other tiers include 5, and 9. The higher the brand level, the more powerful and capable the CPU is.\nThe ‘1’ shows the processor series. As new series are released, this number will go up, like in the Intel Core Ultra 9 288V, where the ‘2’ represents a newer series.\nThe ’55’ is the SKU, which isnt important for the everyday consumer.\nThe suffix ‘H’ indicates the processor type, with the H-series focused on high performance for laptops. Likewise, if you see the suffix ‘U’, it means it’s a power-efficient chipset. This applies to Intel Core as well.\nFor Intel Core Processors:\nCore i7-14650HX as an example.\nThe ‘i7’ is the tier indicator. i3 to i9.\nThe ’14’ indicates the generation of the processor. So, ’14’ signifies a 14th Gen processor. Similarly, ’13’ or ’12’ would denote the 13th or 12th Gen processors, respectively.\nThe ‘650’ is the SKU, which isn't important for the everyday consumer.\nThe ‘HX’ suffix indicates the sub performance of the Processor. A \"U\" designation means it's a \"mobile\" chip, meaning less powerful but more efficient.\n\nA little bit more hard to digest information, I promise it gets easier. \n\nSuffix\tMeaning for the letters you will see on the end of some CPU processors for laptops.\nHX\tHigh-end gaming or workstation laptops where maximum performance and multitasking are essential. Keep this one cool, or your going to cook your laptop.\nHK\tFor gaming laptops, unlocked for easy overclocking, which means shoving more power into your CPU to make it perform faster than it's Base level. While this isn't inherently dangerous, you need to keep the processor cool to do this, and it can reduce the lifespan of the CPU, which is going to be far longer than the rest of the laptop anyways.\nH\tHigh-performance laptops for gaming, content creation, or heavy multitasking.\nU\tPower-efficient chips for everyday tasks like web browsing or productivity, designed for long battery life. \n\nGPU's are just as important as CPU's if you want to use your laptop for media creation, gaming, and creation software that is used professionally and not casually. This includes CAD software like Autodesk Inventor, Blender, etc. \nMost popular GPU's on market are NVIDIA GPU's\n3050 minimum.\n4090, you are just being overkill. \n30, 40 is the generation.\n50, 90 is the tier.\nAs a side note, NVIDIA 50 series GPU's are on their way, so make sure to keep an eye out if you are interested.\nDon't expect any gaming or graphically intensive processing without a dGPU, that means a GPU separate from the ones that are built into CPU's. \n\nRAM is going to be the second most important item for general performance other than the CPU, unless you are a gamer and have a GPU. RAM is your computers short term memory. It really needs this so that things run quickly and smoothly. 16GB of RAM is decent, even great today. But in a year, it may not be so. I suggest a 24GB RAM minimum. 32GB is going to be a more common option though. If you absolutely cannot afford the 32GB option, don't panic, but realize that you may get hurt from it down the road.\nIt is important to note that your RAM is the single biggest determining factor in the lifespan of your laptop. The more RAM, the longer it will last (basically). If your computer starts acting choppy or slow, it could be a RAM issue.\n\nAs of current, an NPU (of what makes an AI chips so special) is (to my understanding) a bit of a marketing thing. They do have real use, but it's not anything your GPU cannot do. Industry is planning on having computers natively compute AI tasks, and that is what the NPU is for. Thing is that those chips are the absolute bare minimum, and the reason why is that we have no actual application made for them, yet.\n\nIf you go on Reddit asking me or anyone else to look at a prospective buy, you gotta realize 3 things. 1, we are not wizards. There is no secret formula. 2. We need details. What do you use it for, what games, photos? Every single detail. You got kids? Will it be treated nicely? Every single detail. 3, I can speak for all tech people that we have never tested every single laptop in existence. Some 2-3,000USD laptops suffer from poor build quality. That's real. And the truth is the industry as a whole actually really wants your money. I can only recommend based on specs, but not build quality. As far as I know, Apple products and Microsoft Surface products are the two suppliers where I can confidently say that you will get a premium build quality (almost) every single time, however these devices are also extremely difficult and expensive to repair.\n\nI suggest at least an 8th Gen Intel Core i5 (i5-8200 for example) with at with 12GB RAM as the bare minimum. For more than 2 years, I recommend at least 12th Generation Intel i5 (i5-12200 or similar) and at least 24GB RAM. Intel's latest Generation of Core CPU's are 14th generation. Those are solid chips. Intel Core Ultras are also really good, but you trade the raw power of Intel Cores for more efficiency. AMD chips are not as common on laptops as Intel Chips are, but do not underestimate AMD. Getting an Intel Core i9 anything is overkill. Even for the best of gamers, Intel Core i7 is just fine. Unless you are doing engineering work or have a computer that requires extreme processing power, not gaming power, but processing power, then you get an Intel Core i9. 256GB of storage is just fine unless you want to store your photos and videos on it. 512GB up depending on how much you want to put on it. Another thing to look out for is SSD vs HDD. You can often get more storage with a HDD, but an SSD is so much faster. Also, once your computer shoots it's last electrical pulse, and it will someday, all you have to do to get all your photos back is to take the SSD and have someone clone it. Basically take it to your local computer repair shop, and if you know what you are doing, you can DIY it (if you know what you are doing). In the case of an HDD failure, you may have to spend thousands to get your data back. It's a spinning disk (HDD) vs (in really basic terms) a super fast USB stick or super fast phone storage (SSD). \n\nIt is important to note the difference between RAM and Storage. \nRAM often comes in configurations like 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, and as stated above, is important for doing tasks quickly. Storage on the other hand, requires a part called an SSD (Solid State Drive)(Modern laptops should not have an HDD - Hard Disk Drive - because they are much slower. However, they are supreme in the amount of storage they can hold. You can buy 24TB HDD off the market. Data hoarder?) an SSD that you find in a laptop will typically have configurations of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB. One TB (Terabyte) is equal to about 1024GB (Gigabytes). KB<MB<GB<TB<PB<YB<whytheheckdoyouneedthatmuchstorage Your SSD will hold things like Photos, videos, games, and more. \n\nI am sorry that the market is confusing, it really is. You don't understand the difference, and that's normal, and that's not ok. Kudos to you for reaching out. I highly suggest AGAINST buying from an online retailer unless it is specifically from the brand you are buying from. No refurbished laptops online, big no no, especially if not from 1st party. Often 3rd party sellers buy defective parts for cheap and then slap together a laptop and sell it. You can get a real actual working computer that meets your specs, except it isn't a laptop because the charging mechanism is broken. Don't buy from 3rd parties online. Don't! I have discovered that going to your local computer repair shop is a fairly safe option for buying a decent computer. They can sell refurbished computers, but this time each one has had a specific time dedicated to it. Even going to Best Buy, you are more likely to overpay for a great laptop than you are likely to overpay for a crappy laptop. If you buy on Amazon or online at all, no third party retailers even if the price is 200USD cheaper. You will lose out on something every time. Also make sure the seller is in your region. Let's say you live in USA Asus sold you a nice laptop at a nice price. 2 months later it dies on you. You go to Asus for the warranty. Well. You bought your laptop from  ASUS Germany which serves, idk, Europe. They won't give you the warranty because you live in the US. This has happened before folks and will continue to happen. Buy from the correct region.\n\nElectronics are expensive, if you buy a cheap price of crap, can you really expect it to work like a premium item? \n\nDo not buy Chromebooks unless you specifically know what it is. Chromebooks seem appealing and are very cheap, and the battery life is really good. However, there is a reason the battery life is so good. The stuff inside it is so weak, it needs so little power, that that battery lasts forever. It's not as bad as having wait times so high it negates the long battery life, but you are still sacrificing performance. I have also discovered that Chromebooks are very limited in compatibility. The apps that you use on your Windows computer sometimes cannot be used on Chromebook. Is there a fix? Probably not one that someone needs help buying a laptop can do. ChromeOS is a flavor of Linux Debian, which is another way of saying it's closer to a crappy, not well made android phone than it is Windows, which is highly polished with wide compatibility. That being said, Chromebooks so have a use. They are awesome low end devices. Anything to be done in a browser can be done in a Chromebook, just don't expect much performance from it. I say this because I myself have a Chromebook, and multiple windows devices. Chromebook is gr8 if you are an android person. Also Chromebook is natively Linux, if you are that kind of person who would want to know that.\n\nWindows is terrible with low end devices. Chromebook was created for them.\n\nYou think a MacBook or an Apple computer will suit your needs better than a Windows or Chromebook? Never buy the baseline. Ever. Always go at least 1 tier above the baseline. It's an expensive bullet to bite, but it won't be more expensive than buying an underpowered laptop. 16GB RAM is actually fine with MacOS because it's built differently from windows. However, never expect to do any heavy lifting with a MacOS system unless you pay several thousand USD for a ridiculously locked down device (see upgrading your SSD for new Mac pros that cost a black market heart). What you gain with Mac is the Apple ecosystem, which is honestly great for the average consumer, and you lose on performance and compatibility, along with customization. You can also get locked out of switching to windows, its just more difficult to switch back, files etc. I will say again, never buy the baseline Apple Product, and remember that you will not be able to upgrade it.\n\nI've seen lots of computers and laptops that say starting at x price and the starting at is absolutely terrible. Look above for your minimums. Do they meet?\n\nSame with buying any cheap laptop. Business knows you don't know what you are buying. If you see anything 4GB or 8GB RAM, STAY AWAY!\n\nYou may see on your listing for a laptop that a battery will last 12 hours. If you look closer you will notice an asterisk. Usually, a manufacturer will place a laptop in \"optimal\" conditions and measure battery life under that. Never expect your laptop to reach an advertised battery life.\n\nSnapdragon processors:\nSnapdragon processors are not the new kids on the block. They have silently been sitting in phones for a while now, but recently, they have appeared in laptops as extremely efficient processors. (Important side note here, AMD has come out with its own line of extremely efficient processors, but they can't compare in price, and that is why the Snapdragon processor shines. More on those coming soon.) Snapdragon processors are based off of a different architecture, and so lots of compatibility issues can arise. Expect most video games to not work, so don't get for your kid. You can expect anything that you do in a browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, TOR) to work very well. You may very well go several days with hours on hours of use to go by without the need to charge. This is perfect for people who only use stuff like browsers. They are also often cheaper, but you can fill in that cheap price with nice things like an OLED display or more RAM. They tend to be very light as well. In essence, snapdragon processors are perfect for those that use things like YouTube and Facebook alot, as you access those through your browser. There have been some issues that have come up with snapdragon computers, and this is because they are a new tech. Any new tech has issues. (Self driving cars, first phones, first computers, AI) And any issues are being smoothed out and will continue to get better. If this sounds good but you want to avoid any issues, you can always wait for the next generation of snapdragon processors to come out. The specialists that work on the creation of the processors will have gathered data on issues and fixed many of them by then. No games. Exceptional for browser usage, better than MacBook battery life.\nOn that note, experts have compared a Snapdragon laptop as a laptop that has better battery life and can do more. (Sick burn) While the Snapdragon processor has some compatibility issues, it is still a Windows machine, which is so much more compatible than laptops that have MacOS.\n\nIf you want a real laptop, start with Business class laptops or laptops aimed at businesses. There are many many alternatives, but one name brand business grade laptop that is reputable are the Dell Latitudes, and another is HP Envy, and another is Lenovo ThinkPads. They can be expensive, but it's a very decent system. For the average consumer, they are a good option. Business class laptops are really good buys, because generally, a business will make a deal with a company, say Dell. Dell wants to keep their contract with this business. To make sure that the business does not switch to Lenovo, they have to make a laptop that will not break down and is easy to fix. Business class laptops also tend to have more documentation and manuals available. The business wants good computers that don't break down, and Dell wants to keep its contract. Thus, the business class laptop is born.\n\nGaming laptop for your kid? Anything less than $600USD is a waste of your time. Expect to spend $800USD. If it doesn't have a discreet graphics card, don't buy it. (For serious gamers only)\n\nIf you are looking to buy a laptop with an Intel Core i7 12th generation and are buying it for your kid to play Roblox, it will be just fine. Same with Minecraft Bedrock or Java Edition. Fortnite, on the edge, anything more sophisticated, and your computer will likely struggle.\n\nFor those not knowing difference between Minecraft Java and Minecraft Bedrock, Because Minecraft is hands down, yes you too conservative grandpa, Minecraft is one of the most if not the most influential game of all time, (this is my personal opinion). Minecraft Java Edition is more CPU intensive, needing better CPU, but is also less microtransactions, more moddable, and has your kids Favorite servers (2B2T for that concerning kid). Bedrock still has popular servers (you will get all those mini games like PVP and bed wars) but is more compatible, playable on phone, PC, and console. I prefer Java, but that's my personal brew. \n\nIf you want a laptop for your kid to play games on like Roblox, Minecraft, or Fortnite, you will need to spend at least $500 for an Awesome Parent Worthy gaming experience. \n\nSome good gaming laptop brands: Acer Nitros, ROG Zephyrus, and Lenovo Legions, and MSI.\n\nSpeaking of Gaming, ever heard of a Nintendo switch? The handheld one? Well, imagine that, but it's a windows computer instead. Now imagine that exists. Now stop, because it does. Unfortunately, I am very poor, but if I was granted a wish, I would get the ASUS ROG ALLY X (yes caps needed). It's a super powerful handheld machine for around $800 ($700USD Back Friday). Yeah, it's expensive. It's older brother, the ROG ALLY is going for around $500. It's a neat machine, and you can hook a monitor up to them and definitely use it as a gaming rig or workstation. Alternatives are currently the MSI CLAW or Lenovo Legion Go. For gamers, another alternative is the SteamDeck and the SteamDeck OLED. Very good machines, as in AAA games good machines, take a look if you are interested. Maybe it's just got a gold filter over it with me, but I think it's freaking cool.\n\nFor those looking for serious gaming laptops, try looking for an at least Intel Core i7 12th Generation with an H or HX or K at the end of the CPU model name. These letters indicate the performance. Also recommend at least a NVIDIA RTX 4080 or equivalent as very high performance. You really don't need more than 60FPS for biological reasons, but 120Hz is where your brain basically caps out. 240hz is another very small increment of improvemenr, but not a lot. I suggest a minimum of 32GB of RAM.\n\nFramework is a relatively new company that specializes is extremely customizable laptops, and you can easily buy one framework laptop and have it last as long as you want because you can simply replace the parts. If you are willing to pay extra for great laptop, with customizability, look no further than framework. Before you ask me what to get, how about you do an internet search first. \n\nFor people just looking for a laptop with a really nice display, OLED displays are widely regarded as absolutely beautiful. The blacks are truly black, and that makes for a world of difference in regards to contrast. They can suck extra battery though.\n\nFor those looking for content creation laptops, if you draw or create videos regularly, you should look into an external storage device, particularly an SSD for that durability. I personally have a Samsung T7 and I love it. However you may find others at better prices. Keep in mind that so many listings are scams, it's mindblowing. There are many \"2 in 1\" laptops that people seem to like. Go find one if you need one.\n\nFor those looking for laptops used for coding, you will want a laptop with a decent CPU. For great performance I suggest an Intel Core i7 at least 11th Generation, or an Intel Core Ultra 7.\n\nFor those going into day trading, I suggest a gaming laptop or similar. If you need fast response times from your computer, you need a powerful laptop, because those milliseconds matter. Also consider getting an Ethernet port for direct connection to your router. This eliminates any instability that can occur with Wi-Fi, especially if you live in a crowded area or have many devices.\n\nPeople have asked if Intel 13th Generation processors have issues. They did at one point. In technical terms processors had a fault in their microcode algorithm that saw them request elevated operating voltages from the motherboard. That can cause instability because too high a voltage can wear chips like these out with time. Basically they were misbehaving. Intel and it's partners have fixes this by releasing BIOS updates, so if you have an issue, update your computer. The problem is largely resolved.\n\nI just typed this out, but it didn't save. Ugh!\nIt is important to know the difference between Windows Pro and Windows Home. Often, you will feel that with Windows Pro, you will get a better product. There is one large thing that is relevant to the consumer that you get with Windows Pro. Bitlocker (more on that soon). With Windows Pro, you get the ability to use Microsoft Remote Desktop. A remote desktop allows you to use a computer you own like you are sitting next to it. For example, let's say I am at work, 50 miles away from my desktop at home. With Windows 10 Pro on my desktop, and Home on my laptop, I can log into my computer at home (assuming it is on and set up) and then I can control my home desktop as if I was there. Super cool. Microsoft remote desktop works best (extra config needed if outside home) inside your own network. This basically means you have to be inside the same wifi, home, apartment, building to use  Microsoft Remote Desktop. Alternatives that are also free that I use is Chrome Remote Desktop, and Parsec, and those do not require windows Pro. I can control my computer from anywhere with these. Remember to never give people access to remote desktop on your computer unless you know them. Scammers do this often to steal your money and data. Other features of Windows Pro are better ability to control systems (IT for school or business) and overall many features that are useful for business. I do not remember each and every one because those that I do not remember were not important enough for me to remember. \n\nAnother large feature of Windows Pro that is actually useful to you is BitLocker. Bitlocker is a program that runs on your computer all the time to encrypt all do your data. Your computer is the only computer that can read this data. This encryption is so hard to crack, that the United States Government would have a very difficult (not impossible) time of decrypting your data. Bitlocker will protect your data, but not your device. If your device gets stolen, nobody can read your data (government documents, corporate emails, etc.) If your device gets stolen, you lose the device and data, but whoever stole the device gets only the device, not the data. Because your device is the only computer that can read your data, if your laptop breaks and you want to get the photos off of your SSD, it will be basically impossible to get your data back. It is encrypted and gone. Bitlocker is often enabled by default on windows pro devices. This means that if you forget your password and you have a windows pro devices, you are probably very very screwed. I highly recommend to learn how to get and retrieve your blocker encryption key, this is a 25 character password. I suggest you make physical copies, take photos and also keep a copy where you keep documents such as birth certificates and passports. If you do not want Bitlocker, you can turn it off. Basically your computer will take a minute to decrypt your drive and you won't lose anything, it just removes the encryption and makes it so no encryption will happen in the future. Normal retrievable files and data. I suggest this if you are not worried about having your data stolen, but are worried about accidentally making it completely unretrieveable. \n\nSystems with higher Specs are going to tend to have lower battery life and higher temperatures. This is normal. However, in my opinion, the low battery life can be attributed to the 100WHr limit on batteries, as it is hard to transport these high power density batteries due to regulation. Manufacturers also neglect to meet this line, with some laptops having 86WHr or 56WHr batteries.\n\nA commenter (Intrepid_Passage_692) on this thread and an obvious to me fellow enthusiast also pointed out some great things which I will share here in their own words. ---\"the difference between a 100 and 200 dollar laptop is insane. 400 is the next jump, then 800, then 1200. Laptops get AMAZING once you spend over 1200 bucks. Past 2k is the land of diminishing returns, at that point buy what you want.\" ---\n(USD assumed, 2k means 2,000USD, a buck is a slang term for a dollar.)---\n\"just get core ultra. They significantly outperform core chips up to ~80-100W. At that point, no one worrying about sub 2k laptops will even be able to afford a chassis that can contain a chip going over 100W without thermal throttling. I have to use a watercooled laptop to tame the 14900hx. I am looking forward to core ultra, even if it means I lose 20% performance at *checks notes* 210W...\"---\n(W means Watts. A laptop drawing 60 watts for an hour will draw 60Whr (Watt Hours) from a battery., 2k means 2,000USD, 14900hx is 14900HX, a 14th Gen Intel Core Processor that is Top of the line, thermal throttling is a term used to describe when your computer reaches its maximum temperature before it reaches its maximum performance, water-cooling is a form of laptop cooling that involves water. Works like a car engine cooling system, with cooling fluid being pumped from the engine to a radiator and back. I disagree with Intrepid the discarding of the Intel Core Series. I feel that if the differences were that high, I would hear more noise about it. I am currently and always looking into it.)\n\n\nFor anyone who made it this far, know that my prices are high bars with padding so that people who do the bare minimum of research can just go buy a laptop priced at $500 and actually get a decent device. (For consumers, if you read the last sentence and decided to take off $100USD from your budget based on that, I highly recommend you retract that decision). I myself got a used $600USD laptop for $350USD and I can do pretty much anything with it. The difference between experienced users and everyday consumers is that they don't know how to get great laptops at great prices. That is why this subreddit exists.\n\n\nFun facts that you can skip through:\n1. lithium ion batteries should be replaced every two years\n2. SSD's have a lifespan, this is measured in TBW (TeraBytes Written) it is unlikely you will reach the end of a SSD lifespan.\n3. Snapdragon Processors are found in mobile phones.\n4. Minecraft, especially Java Edition, is more CPU intensive than GPU intensive.\n5. When a SSD writes it's last byte, it tells the computer it cannot be written to anymore, this makes the computer angry. You can restore the data by simply reading it. Take it to a local repair shop. HDD require a much more expensive fix, as they have moving parts that have physically worn out.\n6. Data written on mediums such as CD's (Compact Disks), DVD's (Digital Video Disk's), HDD's, SSD's and more have a lifespan? Data can disappear over time. If you have a 20 year old CD with a song on it laying around, well you don't. \n7. Lenovo is actually in part owned by the PRC. However, the way it's business is structured and the fact they don't sell completely custom parts, means that even the United States government trusts Lenovo to provide them with Servers and server equipment.\n8. Snapdragon mobile processors are popular in high end phones. The new processors you find in laptops are tweaked so they consume more power and put out more performance, but they use the same architecture.\n9. In 2005, AMD's Athlon 64 FX-57 was overclocked to 10 GHz using liquid helium cooling. Breaking 10GHz was a significant achievement at the time, but it required extreme cooling conditions and was not a commercially available product.\n10. A CPU's GHz does not equal performance. Like other computer things, many variables are involved.\n\n\nI specifically did not mention AMD Ryzen because I do not know the AMD Ryzen naming scheme like I do Intel naming Scheme.\n\nFor fellow enthusiasts, if I get something wrong or leave something out, please leave a comment so I can address it, I will not be offended. \n\nI put lots of love into this guide, and I appreciate hearing back from you to find out if it helped, although you are under no obligation to do so. I do not do this for money.\n\nPersonally, as one may be curious to know, I recently decided to temporarily go broke and I got myself an ASUS ROG ALLY X.\n\nThank you for reading, if you feel the need, remember to stay posted as I update this guide very frequently. Next year this guide will be deprecated as I am planning on making a new and improved guide available next year.\n\nVery recently, have created a new Subreddit where I will create guides like this. It is very new. Go to r/TOOsTechTactics and you will find it. I have always wanted to do something like this, your feedback and time have given me the push to start.\n\nIf you have read to this point and would like to see the 2025 guide, basically this guide but updated, please go here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TOOsTechTactics/s/Qw88cYk4GQ\n\n-An experienced person who has made lots of mistakes and learned from them.",

  "Second post in this thread, first of all, great post!!\nTo get into Amd is not hard and very mich rewarding since they make very good laptop cpu's. Most people would even say, better then intel on the last 2-3 generations.\n\nAllow me to extend your post with this info:\n\n\nAmd ryzen laptop cpu:\n\nExample: Ryzen 7840HS:\n\nJust like intel the first number is the gen: in this case 7\n\nJust like intel has the i3, i5, i7 and i9 tier, Amd has Ryzen 3,5,7,9 tier.\nLook at the second number, here 8 means it's a ryzen 9 (higher then 7).\nthe 40 is subsequent tier number.\n\nThe suffix, here 'HS' indiquates the power/hear target. HS is the highest (for enthousiasts). Look online for other suffixes.\n\n\nThen current gen:\n\nJust like Intel (I feel a pattern here) AMD decided to screw the naming schemes and call their cpu's 'Ryzen AI 9 370' Which basically says it's Ai-ready, which only means they have NPU core, it's expressed in TOPS (google the acronym). The current tier is 360, 365, 370 and 375, I'm sure more will come. They first had an exclusivity contract with Asus, that's why most HX 3xx cpu-powered laptops are from asus but lenovo, hp and other brands are starting to offer them as well.\nThose new cpu's are very much focussed on efficiency, just like the new ultra intel cpu's, and good iGpu.",

I can get the MacBook for 1200$, which might sound like a bad deal for people in the us, but everything is more expensive here so. \n\nPlease note that since im from Denmark most American websites like bestbuy or american amazon is either not useable or will come with some hefty taxes, so im not looking for specific deals, but more just a hint to certain models. I was also looking at the Lenovo Yoga 7i gen 9, but i dont think thats better unless i could get 32GB RAM for a similar price to the MacBook, but please let me know if it is.\n\nI dont know if i’ve just written a bunch of useless stuff, but i hope it gives an insight to my situation and needs, and i would be extremely happy if anyone would be willing to provide some insight",

  "Hello !  \nThank you for this great post.\n\nIn advance sorry for my english as it is not my main language.  \nI am myself in search for a laptop.  \nConsidering that i used to have the macbook pro (mid 2015) that died on me I am in need for a new computer.  \nAs I am an architect i'm looking for a laptop that could manage Autocad/Enscape/Sketchup/Revit and the Adobe suite (maybe a little photoshop AI) smoothly but not planning on doing 3Ds or big rendering. I don't play either on my laptop, or at most indie small stuff. For the rest, classic internet use and i watch movies on it (so i'd like a screen that is kinf of suited for that also)  \nI have to say I'm used to Apple design so i would like a laptop that is nicely finished and not a 3kg gamer laptop with neon lights.  \nPrice range would be from 1200 to 1800 euros, could go higher if its definitly worth it.  \nAnd mostly a laptop that lasts at least 5 years given the price..\n\nI wanted to go for the Asus Zenbook 14 (or S 14) :  \nProcesseur Intel Core Ultra 7 - Puce graphique Intel ARC -32 RAM  \nThat goes for around 1300 for blackfriday, bur read that for architectural work i should go for an NVIDIA RTX and that the intel ARC is not great, there is the 15' version with AMD Ryzen 7 and AMD Radeon but I don't know what its worth (1299 euros)\n\nSo maybe the zenbook pro 14 :  \nIntel® Core™ i9-13900H NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4060 (233 AI TOPs) 8Go GDDR6  \nBut goes for 1880 euros and i seem to find it only with 16gb RAM that seems to be a little low\n\nThen there is the ProArt with PX 13 and P16, but the first seems to have a too little screen and i'v read that its only 60Hz (event if i don't know how bad that is) and the second may be way too expensive and maybe too big.\n\nAnd at last the Microsoft surface laptop 7 Snap dragon X elite (12core) 32 RAM also at 1880 but i have no idea how this knew tech works with the software i use.\n\nSo I come for help, even if you may know other products that may be better suited ? I can pay a little much but wouldn't want to spend for overkill specs for my use.  \nI am pretty surpised when i read that some recent spec are bad for autocad or architectural design while i used a 2015 laptop for autocad/Rhino during my studies and don't remember struggling that much..",

  "Thank you for this post - it's very helpful!\nI wonder if you (or perhaps another reader on the thread) can comment about build quality (of course nothing is 100% for sure, but still!) and number of cores.\n\nSpecifically, I am looking at two computers:\n\n[Asus Vivobook S 14](https://www.walmart.com/ip/ASUS-Vivobook-S-14-14-WUXGA-OLED-PC-Laptop-Intel-Core-Ultra-7-32GB-RAM-1TB-SSD-Black-S5406/7447569796?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&sourceid=dsn_ad_67b24a3e-8de0-4c6a-a2eb-385363192ede&veh=dsn&wmlspartner=dsn_ad_67b24a3e-8de0-4c6a-a2eb-385363192ede&cn=FY25-Holiday-GIFT-PMax_con_dps_dsn_dis_ad_xcat_s_n&gclsrc=aw.ds&wl9=pla&wl11=online&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA3ZC6BhBaEiwAeqfvymZYDTNdBAzq54K-ePX6-NeGaIbigDYaKaqaltlRMcBxEQsD4hHEBhoCIiwQAvD_BwE)\n\n[Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 11](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx1/thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-11-14-inch-intel/21hm002fus)\n\nWith sales/coupons they end up a similar price (~1000 USD - I know the Lenovo defaults to showing more on that page, but member sales make it really cheap). On paper, the Vivobook's specs are a touch better (slightly newer processor, twice as much storage (terabyte vs. half), larger battery, OLED screen), and otherwise they're pretty much the same.\n\nMy main questions are:\na) do you have thoughts on the processor difference? (Intel Ultra 7 258V vs. Core i7-1365U vPro). Lots of benchmarking sites say that the ultra is performing better, but it also has several fewer cores and I just don't know if that will be an issue in the long run somehow? This is beyond my expertise.\n\nb) What's the catch with the Vivobook/which is a safer bet? The Vivobook is not supposed to be Asus's premium/flagship line, and yet it has amazing specs for very cheap, relatively. Are they known to fall apart? Hinge issues? Something weird? Is the Lenovo a safer bet given that it's from their flagship line? But also I've heard people say their battery life isn't great so maybe it's not?\n\n\n\nI know I can't have it all, but these seem very, very close to it: powerful machines that are nonetheless very light and portable.\nAt this moment they're maybe overkill for my needs - I'm a social sciences researcher so I do a lot of word processing, I make presentations, excel, sometimes R and other research programs, and mostly I often have a lot of programs open at the same time (think word, a reference manager, Spotify, excel, Teams or similar, and multiple browser tabs). I also occasionally watch shows/movies or do very light gaming (when I have time, which currently I don't), but these are much less critical for me. I prioritize performance over storage - I store the largest segments of my data off of my computer anyway.\nBut anyway, I like having computers for a long time and I'm hoping these will last.\n\n\nNo pressure to give feedback - I think I'm just torn between two very good options, and it's hard to go wrong (but also hard to choose)!",

  "Thanks for all the time you put into this! I'm looking for a new laptop because mine which I had for 4 and a half years just stopped working. I don't use it for work (have one for that) or gaming, mostly just watching shows on streaming services, YouTube, live sports, etc. and then general stuff like google docs and whatnot. Therefore I do not need anything specific on it, I just want one that will last. Do you have any brand recommendations and a minimum price recommendation for something like that?",
  "First things first, I appreciate the effort you gave to make this post. I agree with your reasoning too, teaching people how navigate computers is better than a random stranger spitballing recommendations online. If I bought a laptop someone recommended me and it underperformed, I’d be pissed. This atleast helps give people a scope to realize you have to shell out some cash for a decent laptop. I have a few criticisms/add ons though.\n\n1) I9 started being produced gen 8, not Gen 5. Doesn’t really matter other than there isn’t a single i3 (i5s push it) that’s better than the og i9-8950hk. (8 year old chip btw) \n\n2) ram should take precedent over cpu at this point. 8GB of ram makes my 14900hx perform like a 10th gen i5 with 32GB of ram. It literally dictates how long your computer will last. If you want to use it for more than 2 years, 16gb minimum. If you have a computer with 8gb of ram and it feel like things run slow or choppy, it’s the ram. \n\n3) If you intend on doing ANY gaming, you need a dgpu. 0 exemptions other than sims 4 and games pre 2014. Even Roblox/minecraft on integrated graphics is a terrible experience ESPECIALLY with 8gb of ram. \n\n4) your 3 paragraphs going in detail about the suffixes of intel chips can be condensed into one because 3/4th of it isn’t applicable anymore. If people are buying chromebooks from 2020 with 9250g’s in them they should’ve read the beginning of your post better. The only laptops with g or y chips are Chinese temu shitbooks\n\n5) the difference between a 100 and 200 dollar laptop is insane. 400 is the next jump, then 800, then 1200. Laptops get AMAZING once you spend over 1200 bucks. Past 2k is the land of diminishing returns, at that point buy what you want.\n\n6) just get core ultra. They significantly outperform core chips up to ~80-100W. At that point, no one worrying about sub 2k laptops will even be able to afford a chassis that can contain a chip going over 100W without thermal throttling. I have to use a watercooled laptop to tame the 14900hx. I am looking forward to core ultra, even if it means I lose 20% performance at *checks notes* 210W…\n\n7) I understand why you recommend userbenchmark but notebookcheck is infinitely better, just harder to navigate. If you want to do one better look up 3d mark or cpumark scores.",

  "Hi, thanks but I disagree with some things.  \n\nI have CDs over 20.  They still play flawlessly.  The data on a CD is expected to last 100 years.  Longer if you keep them from corrosion.  The data is not magnetic and does not rely upon an electrical charge.  Probably lack a player for playback before the disc goes bad.\n\nMy info says most cheap SSDs will last only 5 years or so before they fail.  Maybe longer depending on usage.  Depends on how much you fill it and how many deletes and rewrites you do.  We'll see in a few years I guess. \n\nCPU Ghz does mean performance.  That's why we have overclocking on CPUs and GPUs.   That's part of why a newer i5 can beat an older i7.  Computationally intensive apps like CAD and even Minecraft will benefit from high Ghz CPUs with great single core performance.  Intel CPUs tend to be better in this than AMD ones.\n\nUS Gov trusts all the spies been in it for decades.  Everywhere from Air Force recruits to US Commanders to US Congressmen like Menendez.  Who cares if they trust Lenova - I don't.  No HP, I don't recommend you either.\n\nLi batteries lose capacity over time but they vary and can still hold 80 percent up to 10 years or more.  Depends on usage.  My laptop is still using a 5 year old battery no problem.  It does not last as long, true.  Probably depends on charge/depletion cycles and the quality of the battery, etc.  They should be replaced when you aren't getting enough usage time anymore.  Hopefully car li batteries last more than 2 years... What happens to all these old batteries?  Where are they going?  Are they toxic?  Does anyone care?\n\nHere's my advice:  1. only buy windows 11 pc's now, 2. laptop ram is not upgradable so only buy one with 16 Gb plus now.  Resist the half priced 8 Gb ones if you work on your pc.  3. Opinions vary but I think Intel i7 14700 is still the best bang for the buck if you do CAD, MineCraft etc.  Leave the Core AI CPUs for later when there's actually some useful AI to bother with.  4. Don't let Windows 11 attempt to update your brand new PC's bios.  The AI and CoPilot are just too dumb to do much of anything correctly.\n\nI just returned my GF's new HP laptop.  Thanks Staples for making it easy.  The laptop was really nice with great look and feel to the hardware but Windows 11 tried to update the bios.  One Drive could not even find its own files and folders.  Anivirus not working warning right at first startup - no antivirus activated on brand new HP laptop - not even Windows Defender.  Popup ads galore every startup.  Do research online just to figure out how to disable all the ads popping up and literally filling the screen with ads.  So back it went.  Just as well, it only had 8 GB ram hard installed when MS recommends 16Gb for its Core CPUs. LoL\n\nGuess what HP and DELL are planning on?  Everyone in the entire world that is still on windows 10 is being forced to get a new PC before Oct 2025.  We're talking billions or even trillions of dollars.  Collusion?  Or just a case of when interests coincide?  LoL",

I mostly do mid end gaming, nothing competitive, but I do like to have a couple programs (Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop, pdf viewer, Discord, maybe Blender, or occasionally a CAD program like Revit or ArchiCAD) open. I can happily keep my load a little less, but I'm more concerned the 16GB will be out of date quick. I usually keep it at home, and I don't mind how heavy it is. I plan to buy a cooling pad if I get the higher up one.\n\nI'm not sure why the price difference is so large. Could you/anyone please help me understand the biggest differences function-wise that you see? One has a higher quality Intel processor, the other an older AMD, but is this why the price gap is big? I appreciate it. : ] \n\nEDIT: (Also, I know the $1k option has no iGPU, I'll keep it plugged in while using so I'm not worried about battery life. Just want to know if the $400 price hike is actually worth it. I currently have an old MSI Intel Core i7-8750H with a Nividia 1050 Ti graphics card and 32 GB RAM I got in school 2018. It has always done well, I've loved it, but i need something in between getting a desktop in a few years, so this may be temporary and that's why I'm leaning to get the cheaper option.) \n\n🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼",

However, video editing, even putting your photos in an slideshow video doesn't require alot.

It stores slightly less data than a hard drive but achieves 40x 50x 100x 400x speeds than a hard drive does. You do not need 64GB of RAM to sort through files.

  "Ok my friend.\n\nSurface Pros are a nightmare to repair.\nI have heard the laptops are much easier.\nThe reason why this is significant is that in the case you break your laptop, and you take it into the repair shop, the poor guy who tries to help you because you needed it fixed by yesterday can actually fix it. You may not know, but parts are extremely hard to find, for a good price. \nExample, some MacBook pro models require you to buy a new screen when you want to purchase a new battery.\nBatteries should be replaced every two years, as per expert recommendation, as the capacity and health will decline over time. However, this screen battery combo is $600-$800USD, which is insane. And if you don't want to pay that, your only option is to buy aftermarket, and who knows what Chinese warehouse aftermarket is from. I've gotten good parts and bad parts from aftermarket. And then your computer repair guy takes the loss of its not a good part. Screen replacements can cost $100USD to $1000USD. No joke.\nHowever, I recommend at least 24GB of RAM for a laptop that you want to last 2+ years.\nSurface laptop is like buying a MacBook. It's a premium machine. You are paying extra for that premium that comes with the Surface brand name. Surface is directly owned by Microsoft, FYI.\nPost me a link for your SL7 and I can take a better look at it.\nIr you can find alternatives, I will be happy to advise you on whether or not the specs will last for 3 years or more.\nDo be aware I am not a future seeing wizard.\nDo be aware I cannot advise on durability, as of the millions of laptops out there, I have not used all of them for 5+ years.",
  "To be honest, you can buy ultra5 version instead, the difference between ultra7 155U and ultra5 125u, is likely to be less than 5%. Good luck with HP laptops.",
  "32GB should be enough for a thousand browser tabs. Am not familiar with Ryzen, but considering those other specs, probably OK. I can't vouch for any laptop's build quality. They vary so widely even within the brands, and I haven't used all 50 100 million laptops ever in production.\n\nAs long as the CPU is sufficient, I checked, equal to Intel Core i7-13700KF, you will be just and very fine. You may be going a little overboard on the CPU but it isn't overkill.",
  "As of current, an NPU (of what makes an AI chips so special) is (to my understanding) a bit of a marketing thing. They do have real use, but it's not anything your GPU cannot do. Industry is planning on having computers natively compute AI tasks, and that is what the NPU is for. Thing is that those chips are the absolute bare minimum, and the reason why is that we have no actual application made for them, yet.\n\nYou are probably going to want more RAM down the road, upgrade from 16GB.\n\nOption two will be ready for AI if it does come out, because it has a great 4050 GPU. I'd get option 2, it has great specs, and a dGPU. That's basically the biggest thing in its favor following with the i7-14th gen, of which is the best of the best designation with HX, which basically means it's really cool (it can overclock, for enthusiasts only)\nI cannot vouch for build quality, unfortunately. Omen is made by HP, so take that with it. Just take good care of it. Laptops are not indestructible, but it is infuriating that they don't make them better \n\nThis will handle his music tasks like a pro if he can keep it cool and keep it clean.",
  "Assuming that's a 13th Gen i5 you should be fine. That sounds great.",
  "Even if I did know a cheaper option, it probably would not be avaliable in your area.\n\nPeople hate on Intel. However, they are still the most popular brand out there. \nAssuming you are willing sacrifice performance for a little more battery life, getting a Core Ultra 7 or an Intel Core i7 should be ok.",
  "I did not click on the links.\n\nThe Ultra 7 (no 2).is going to have middle performance compared to no 4 highest of the bunch (excluding 1) And no 3's lowest performance.\n2,3,4 are great options, with the most powerful being 1,4,2,3. \n\nYou are going to love the OLED screens, especially when watching movies, 3,4\n\n16GB RAM on all of those is living on the edge. I would look and see if the RAM is soldered down, and if you can replace it later on. It's not an immediate issue. \n\n2,3,4 are all great computers with 1 being a little overkill.\nAs I said in my guide, the Intel Core Ultra will be more efficient (relatively)\nAnything else?",
  "You don't need an iGPU, you want a dGPU. Option 2 has a dGPU. An iGPU is an Integrated Graphics Processing Unit, which means the graphics lives inside of your CPU, it's a mini GPU that isn't sufficient for high end gaming. It's great because it's more efficient and good for basic tasks and light gaming. A dGPU is a Dedicated Graphics Processing Unit. It is it's own chip that is usually much more powerful than an iGPU. This is what you want for high end gaming or performance, it's not as efficient as having an iGPU, but much more powerful.",

  "Can you include your GPU with that listing along with CPU processor and RAM?",
  "Some people say that MacBook's don't need as much RAM as Windows, and I haven't seen any huge issues arise from this. 16GB RAM on Mac is just fine. MacOS is a different operating system from windows, it's built differently. What you gain with Mac is battery life, what you lose is performance and compatibility, however, for your use case it's just fine.\nSorry for not clarifying this, good luck m8.\n\nJust because your from different country doesn't mean I can't give you advice tailored to your situation. Know that I as an American respect you and your country.",
  "I can see a very wonderful block of HTML when I load the link.\nAssuming you game, you will have a GPU. Your GPU will be more than sufficient to do AI tasks. AI ready and AI chips are a bit of a marketing thing. If I had to sum it up, I would say the Ultra Core 9 would act more like an Intel Core i8.25, if that existed. Ultra 7, like an i6.25, and Ultra 5 like an i4.25.",
  "My man, I highly recommend against 8GB of RAM, unless you are comfortable with the performance hit, I strongly recommend against it. Times have changed and 8GB is simply not enough. Feel free to not take my recommendations, but do remember it will come at a cost. It's got a decent i5 12th Gen processor, and it's going to be powerful ish, but the fact that the i5 12th Gen you picked out is mobile, makes it more like a powerful i3 12th Gen. That's still fine with day to day browsing.",
  "Woah. Ok, I cannot recommend on the build quality of any specific computer. That would take hours of my day. Sorry m8.\n\nHowever, I can help with the H and U designation.\nA U processor has better battery life, but much less performance, relative to the chip. The H has more performance, and less battery life, relative to the chip. I'd say (this is a complete guess) a 30 min to 1 hour difference in battery life and 10-30 fram difference. Keep in mind this is a guess based on intuition! \n\nSeeing as how you wanted a laptop with an integrated CPU, I suggest getting a CPU. ;D any laptop with an i5 or Intel Core Ultra has a CPU!\nWhat you will want is to have an H processor with a graphics card like an RTX 3050 like you mentioned for gaming. Have a U processor for a laptop that you take around for school and stuff, if that is what you wanted.",
  "Was it the starting at machine?\n\nFor a Windows machine, 8GB is horrendous. For a Mac, you need about 25% less RAM. Id go with a 16GB model if possible.\nYou won't be able to do any gaming or high demand applications with any Mac, but you get great battery life and the Apple Ecosystem.",
  "It's ok to post here, I think it's cool I am reaching people from all over the world! I could not reach the link, if you look up how DNS servers work, you can learn why. \nThat will absolutely meet your needs, it will be just fine. Other than the 16GB of RAM, which I would prefer to be 24GB of RAM, it all looks good. However, if your needs are game emulation and FFXIV, then you will do just fine with that laptop.",
  "It's fine, I understood your English just fine. :)\nFor a good screen, an OLED screen is widely regarded as the most beautiful of screens. The darks are very dark, you'd just have to see it compared to a backlit display (LED, IPS, LCD)\nIntel Arc Graphics are by no means bad. Intel is making Arc as a direct competitor to NVIDIA and AMD. They have done a really great job even I applaud them. That card will only get better, it is good enough now to suit your needs. If that sounds good to you, I'd go with the Asus Zenbook 14 with the Arc Graphics and Intel Core Ultra 7.\nZenbook pro 14 is a big no. I have no clue why they would build such a beast with an i9 processor and 16GB of RAM, overkill processor, inadequate RAM.\n60Hz refers to the amount of times your display will refresh, like the Frames Per Second in movies or Games. You don't need higher unless you are high end gamer, although these displays with high refresh rates tend to have smoother look and feel, incrementally. You don't need it, is what I am trying to say. 60Hz is just fine.\nFor CAD, the CPU does 60% of the work. Intel Core Ultra 7 will handle it fine.",
  "1, no, it has 8GB RAM. 2 for the same, 3 same reason, but 16GB of RAM, and 4 is also 16GB of RAM. Don't expect any of these to last 4 years simply on the Basis of too little RAM. Aim for 24GB or more.\nThe other specs look good, RAM is the one issue.\nIn other words you could have the exact same machine work, I would recommend the exact same machine if they met the 24GB RAM recommendation.",
  "It's not that much of a difference, thinking relative to your needs now. It's a significant performance difference, but I cannot find a good reason to justify the $40. Acer laptop also seems to be the better deal because of the 1TB SSD and the better battery. However, for web browsing, the size SSD is not a major problem. If you want a laptop that will last anywhere from a little more to maybe extend the life by a year, go for it. It's up to you. \nThe RAM will likely be the biggest determining factor in the lifetime of the laptop. Make sure to consider of the RAM is soldered on either before making a final decision, as of it is soldered, it basically eliminates life support for your laptop.",
  "Phantom Forces is the way.\nJava for Kings. (Or Queens now I got to figure out a better term for it)\n\nRoblox FPS caps out at 60, as far as I know. I very easily get 60 FPS on a 10th Gen Intel i5 CPU and a RTX 3050. Vanilla Minecraft Java I get basically everything along with OBS recording in the background. You will be just fine specwise my dude.",
  "This will be just fine to game on Roblox. Exceptional. Idk why people say OLED bad this and OLED bad that. Today, an OLED screen is one of the most beautiful screens you can get, beautiful coming from experts and not me. The darks are true dark so the contrast is great. 11.5 hours of battery is a lie, I will add that to my list. realistically about 4-6 hours. It should be fine, just make sure he carries a charger, and 6 hours isn't even bad. Batteries just don't last that long. They test that figure with \"optimal\" conditions, which is usually turning brightness all the way down, turning on power saving and playing a 720p mp3 video. \nIntel Arc Graphics are higher end than Iris, from what I gain. \nIntegrated Arc is just the graphics included in your CPU, CPU:s usually have a mini GPU for display when you don't have a dGPU.",

  "I think you should upgrade the RAM for it if you would like to keep it for more than 2 years. It will be great for video editing and Gaming as it has an RTX 4060 inside of it. I can not tell you whether something is a good deal. Prices can vary by region and simple whim, and it is hard to keep track of all that. I would suggest comparing it to similar spec'd items to consider whether it is a good deal.",
  "First thing, 16GB RAM is not overkill, it is too little when the laptop is expected to last two years. you should have at least 24GB of RAM to future proof it. This is especially important considering the amount of screens.\n\nYou need to make sure your computer will support that amount of screens, not just the processor. Some computers are limited to two monitors or three, make sure to check.\n\nFor day trading, I recommend having a laptop with an Ethernet port attached. This model does not seem to have one, but you can buy an Ethernet to USB adapter. Ethernet eliminates Wi-Fi instability. I made a segment in my guide.\n\nI would not be surprised if they made a little change to the price like that, just to get you to buy it. I cannot recommend a fair price, as it varies by region and whim.",

I am aware they have those gold CD-s, maxim gold? That last 100-200 years. Again, will have to look into it.\n\nCheap SSD's don't last 5 years, if it is plugged in, it is still ok. Leaving an SSD unpowered for more than 5 years and you should expect to see data loss. \n\nLenovo laptops are Hit or Miss, most laptops are, however, their high end servers seem to not be.\n\nI admit that I have seen widely varying lithium ion battery life, but experts I trust who specialize in batteries recommend 2 years as general advice.\n\nI know that CPU's have things like memory cache, which affect performance of CPU, I am strong in my position that CPU GHz is not direct performance.

Problem is that they have had some compatibility issues since they are basically a super phone processor in a laptop.

I would suggest specifically looking if your program is supported if you are looking into buying. Surface Laptop 7 seems to be widespread deal for snapdragon processors. \n\nAnother recommendation if you want to forgo the battery life in favor of higher performance and the top tier of compatibility, try a core ultra Processor. At least Core Ultra 5 for your use.",

There is a reason why I specifically name NFL website...\n\nSnapdragon laptop is supreme for battery life, read my segment on it in my guide. \n\nNone of the links are working for me.

  "The RAM is only 16GB, don't expect it to last more than 2 years until you start to experience slowdowns.\n\nBecause it is a gaming laptop, it is more likely to have upgradable RAM. This is something you can do at home with a screwdriver and a bit of knowhow. You can buy 32GB worth of RAM for around $60, and you can do so in a year. I would check to make sure your laptop's RAM can be upgraded.",
  "That will be just fine, however the 16GB could turn out to be a problem. I wrote a segment on RAM upgrade, check it out. This would be under no 13 of things to know before I tell you the things you need to know.",

  "Yea, the Vivobook looks great on paper with the RAM, monitor, and benchmarks, but funny enough, when I watched all the marketing and obvious shill reviews it actually made me more suspicious.\n\nI have a 4090 on my desktop for doing image generation, so I'm familiar with using AI tools, but all the hype for AI chips smells funny, which is why I'm asking about them.\n\nI actually have an Omen from 2019 still going strong. Though it hasn't travel much so I can't really say how durable it is. I was able to run 3D applications and video at the time, but now I pretty much use it for drawing applications. Never had any problems with it, it's been a smooth machine in my experience.\n\nI read there was a motherboard defect in the previous 13th gen line, but it got sorted out with the 14th gen, so I think their bad reputation is not unfounded.\n\nThe ThinkPad is tempting for their reputation, but the Omen seems like such a better value with the CPU & GPU.",
  "Thanks a lot!",
  "Funnily enough after I wrote my initial reply I've been looking at 32gb models after focussing on your comments around future proofing, though it does seem another tier in terms of pricing. There is an Ultra 9, 32gb version of number 2, which, with discounts via work, comes out at around £850 though even still that's a fair bit above my original budget \n\nI'm not sure about any other particular laptops yet, I feel like I've honed in a little on the Zenbooks but I'm always open to suggestions!",

  "It’s the HP Spectre’s model. New ones on sale was like $1100+ or so 3 weeks ago, then open box knocked it down to $790, later it dropped to $684, now sitting at barely $600. It overkills all my needs. I think Lot of floor samples are getting off shelf, that’s why it’s dirt cheap. Same thing is happening with Lenovo Yoga 9i. \n\nIt feels so beautiful and fast, steal of the year for sure. Battery cycle shows only 4, so it barely was used, not even a floor sample, just some random Joe opened and returned. I ran some basic bench online, almost same as MacbookAir M3 chips I checked in store.\n\nHow good is Intel Arc actually? I thought it was some kind of integrated graphics Iris Xe and sh!t like before, but it’s actually a legit GPU and surprisingly ok with some games. \n\n\nCheers.",

  "Hi, I liked your write-up and some good info btw.  As for online info, a lot of variation depending on usage and experiences is what you find.  A lot of people repeat what they read but have no actual experience.  I do sometimes but usually only after I verify with sources I trust.  My laptop is a Dell Latitude with i7, 12Gb, SSD and is too slow for gaming and too small a display for CAD so I use mostly for going online, office apps and 3D print slicer apps.  I can't afford to game on a laptop.  I have a home built desktop, i7 CPU but more ram and GTX video I use for CAD and some Steam games.  I used to use only AMD because it was my preference, maybe due to pricing, but I do CAD probably more than gaming so I look for high ghz single core performance and that's usually intel.  \n\nIMO for gaming you can't beat a console.  Xbox or Playstation - at $500 its a steal compared with building a gaming PC and keeping it updated every couple of years so you can keep playing the current titles.  Let's see, should I spend $350 on a new CPU, $200 on a new board, $500 on a new video card and $70 on some more RAM and make due with my SSD for now or maybe get a Series X 1TB no-disc version for $399 plus $60 a year?  I actually prefer the console gaming experience but I have to keep my PC upgraded for CAD so I end up doing both every few years.",

I've been using refurbished laptops that break after a year for the last few years and I'm done with that mess because it's a huge headache when they fail.  I'm considering taking the risk on a Nimo cyber monday deal (that's the brand that the other commenter linked above).  The 16 ram and 1tb is on sale for $299 and the same specs but 32 ram is on sale for $379.  In your opinion, is it worth spending the extra $80 on the extra 16 of ram?  Sorry if I'm using the wrong lingo, hopefully you get the gist.\n\nSecond question that is a bit off topic, but you seem to REALLY know your stuff and I'm so impressed.  What do you recommend for data hoarders to use to back up their data?  My refurbished pc began to fail last week at the worst possible time and I realized I hadn't backed anything up in about two months.   Do you recommend any particular program?  I've just been copying and pasting my data onto an external but can't find a system to keep track of what I've backed up.  I suck at tech stuff but do have a TON of data that I must keep secure.

  "I've looked at both laptops. The first laptop with an AMD processor is a decent processor, but the one with the core ultra 7 may be better, although I am not sure. Which model of Ultra 7 is it? 64GB of RAM will not be used much, but you won't notice any slowdowns related to RAM for sure. The graphics card of the second one will help with graphics processing, but you need CPU for audio processing. \nFor double the price, it isn't double the performance.\nHP has been notorious for build quality issues. People seem to love Lenovo ThinkPads (specifically the T and P series) but personally I cannot vouch for them. \nLess ports is a thing that everyone is doing. it's cheaper and it looks nicer, although it limits usability. do note that a good laptop dock can cost $400. I would go for a better processor, at least a processor with an H at the end of it. Like an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H or Intel Core i7-13500H. Those would be perfect for flawless dj work, and it should be over the minimum enough to avoid slowdowns. \nI wouldn't go for 16GB anything, as I described above.",

They are not top line yet, but Intel is a monster of a company with a place in the market, it will catch up. I can imagine people saying instead of two big GPU makers there are three.

I know it hurts. I really do.\nFor data hoarders, windows has a built in backup thing called backup and restore windows 7, you can still find it in windows 11 or 10. I use it every single month, works great. I also use AOMEI to do a second set of backups (same data different medium) have not had to ever use those backups so I don't know how well aomei works but backup and restore, well,.you can restore from right there. There is a recommended method for data backup, but I am not going to type that out. I recommend getting two external HDD if whatever size, maybe 2TB or 1TB (TB is TeraByte, 1,000GB or 1,024GB (windows makes this weird, it's why your drives may seem smaller than advertised, not going to explain it)) those two HDD should have the exact same stuff on them, if one fails which HDD's do, mechanical spinning disks, you will have time to buy and receive a new one and not lose any data. I personally backup to two separate HDD, one is bigger so one has more data, but all the same data, and then I also have various external drives that I use to keep single use data, for archival purposes. Cannot lose all those books.  HDD failure is a fact of life but if you buy a decent HDD (I buy Seagate ones) then treat it like it can happen but not likely to. Be aware but not afraid.\nI have a 500GB Samsung T7 which I love because it's aluminum chassis and I think cost me a out $30USD, I could be wrong. SSD is more expensive per GB of data but it will take a VERY long time to wear away especially if you write around a TB a month. Also when SSD fail unless it's on fire, you can still get data off of it you just can't put it on. No writing, only reading. Makes it basically fail proof. Never store data for more than 5 years, it can fade away. Make sure plug it in leave it there every year or so, something like that. \n\nMy eyes burning so no fixing red lines\n\nNo problem, I love helping you guys out.\nI want to acknowledge all the guys in my field who make a living off of their passion. it's not easy. People are not accommodating and are frankly rude and disrespectful. I hate seeing computer shop owners so jaded, because it tells of the abuse they have suffered. It's getting harder to repair, it's getting harder to find parts, and companies are going out of their way to make an extra buck just so you throw your device away after a year or two. I even found it a bit exasperating having 32 notifications once just trying to eat my dinner (wasn't that much  of a dinner, I burned my eggs). It can be frustrating. On top of that some Redditers got angry over the fact that I made a guide in the first place. Comments of appreciation like yours are so helpful, and make me want to do this and better next year.

I also think that to the average consumer, it isn't all that much of a difference. I see this in the light that the average enthusiast is not the average consumer.",

  "Just got my vivobook S16 HX 370 32gb ram today.\nIt's still in the initial installation process.\nSo far it feels very premium, nice alu body and everything seems perfect. I do notice a design flow though: The exhausts of the fans are toward the back of the laptop, but if you open the laptop with the screen at more than 95-100° angle, part of the screen is blocking the exhaust. There is 1 nice curve to counter that but it doesn't fully let the exhaust open, some air blows onto the screen due to this.\nIt is also getting quite hot during the update process, as I saw on the zenbook reviews (way more reviews on that one then the cheaper Vivobook S16 with this specific cpu).\n\nI have an asus motherboard in my desktop and their thermal pads are crap, so at some point I will probably repoace the pads and paste with upsiren putty and ptm 7950, I hope this will help get less hot, we'll see.",

  "Totally understandable. There's a particular store here in the UK where I can get 10% off all laptops and then an additional 6%.

  "Beautiful machine.  The bezels look terrible on YouTube vids but not bad in  person.\n\nSo far everything works and it's silent as a mouse until I game.   Even gaming it was relatively quiet.\n\nAudio sucks from headphone jack and speakers. Dolby certified means absolutely nothing.  Take that with a grain of salt, I'm coming from macbook pro.\n\n4k screen is beautiful but mine came with 2 white spots.  Don't know wtf that is.  Again I'm coming from Mac, that never happens on a brand new screen.\n\nMight be too heavy for me I'm very mobile and was looking to upgrade my MacBook. \n\nI usually use my laptop in the restroom, but this one feels to heavy. I wish it was lighter, but don't blame lenovo it's a workstation.",
  "By chance would you mind checking what the Maximum Graphics Power Wattage is listed in the Nvidia Control Panel System Information?\n\nThanks!",

  "Ok. Do you have the 3070 or 3080? I had hoped it may be on par with the 140W 3070 but it looks like its a significant difference in power. I saw in the hardware manual the picture of the heatsink for this gen2 model has another heatpipe so I was hoping it had higher limits.\n\nI will only use 11800H / 3070 / FHD so it probably will run at a decent frame rate even at 90W.",
  "[deleted]",
  "I have 3080. Yeah, that's  disappointing to me to. \n\n I think the main reason it doesn't is simply the thinkpads go through rigorous military testing. The high wattage gpu is probably being tested now along with a new vapor chamber.\n\n I think that's another reason for the legion line. They can test and make mistakes without damaging reliability or the thinkpad strong brand name.\n\nAlso have to test on an external monitor with 244 hz to really see the max fps",

  "Even with the lower wattage I appreciate that Lenovo offers the Geforce cards in their workstation laptop. I would rather pay less for a 3070MQ than an A4000MQ in the P15.\n\nI think the Vapor Chamber would not work in the T15g as is because the modular GPU sits at a different height than CPU. Hopefully though the heatpipe cooling is comparable to the \"Coldfront\" system used in the Legion 5 Pro.\n\nThe Legion line is nice and gets better every year, but the Thinkpad is still closer to what I want for build quality and aesthetics. I also prefer a 1920x1080 panel which is only offered on the low end Legion which has a plastic body.",

  "Lenovo P17 Workstation vs/ XPS 17 Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve done some research, asked reddit etc., and have widdled it down to 2 laptops/workstations. Reddit suggested both, a Lenovo-employee was super helpful and a redditor really helped me out by comparing the two.\n\nI’m looking at 2 laptops and have left the link for the P17 for people to take a closer look.\n\n$$ - 2,000-3,000 (my work is paying for it!)\n\n* What I want – sturdy, durable, will last a while, heavy = strong (bring it on)\n* What I use – very basic DJ software to mix music, plus I download movies\n* How I use it – I can always have it plugged in, I just want it strong\n* I don’t care for the touch-screen, in fact I don’t want it.\n\nI’m leaning for the P17 - $2639 version, but here’s what a very helpful redditor said about the two:\n\n“P17 is a workstation. Maximum power out of its specs (a 2060 / 3060 middle-ground card and a 9th gen I9), which make it more powerful in graphics-demanding stuff but not as good CPU-wise (11th gen is just power). P17 has an 11800H and a 4GB GPU.\n\nXPS is for the businessman who also needs to edit videos (maybe ads) or do some 3D work, very good but may show the lack of RAM the 3050ti suffers from. It also has less ports and may get louder as it's thinner. It's built to give a premium feel, even sacrificing a bit of power for looking and feeling (sturdy) as it is. Were I you, I'd go XPS, maybe splurging the extra 50 for the 3050TI.”\n\nWhat would you do?? Thanks for any suggestions!\n\n[https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-p/ThinkPad-P17-Gen-2-17-inch-Intel-mobile-workstation/p/WMD00000480?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fl.facebook.com%252F&fbclid=IwAR1FVxAnwJMgzKjfA1x3SRGN0hh8WRHrxogeKpaeHqKINT\\_pJp8\\_j4bG7D0](https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-p/ThinkPad-P17-Gen-2-17-inch-Intel-mobile-workstation/p/WMD00000480?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fl.facebook.com%252F&fbclid=IwAR1FVxAnwJMgzKjfA1x3SRGN0hh8WRHrxogeKpaeHqKINT_pJp8_j4bG7D0)",
  "Sounds like you were misguided. Don't know exactly what software and hardware you use, but for [music mixing and production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qlz-U9eSMs) they are an overkill. Workstations are for scientific model simulations, real-time 3D rendering, VR game development, etc.\n\nThe thing about \"durability\" is being heavy and sturdy has nothing to do with it. In fact, you pretty much want the opposite. A laptop that is lightweight as possible made of strong flexible materials that can absorb the impact if you accidentally drop it or if it gets hit by an object. Like how small insects can survive a fall or being thrown around.",
  "I would say out of the bunch the P17 is the better, since it is more powerful and the XPS has some terrible QA issues. The P17 is not a machine that is meant to be portable though. I would say it is more meant to be a desktop replacement. However for the things you want to do the P17 is overkill. DJ software and DAWs can run on more affordable hardware. If you still want the top of the line ThinkPad experience and repairability and everything that comes with that name I would suggest you look at the P15. \nIf you only want to use it for creative things and want it to last a long time, a 16\" M1 Macbook Pro could also be interesting for you.",
  "Hmm, I was basically ready to buy the P17 but your comment that it is \"not a machine that is meant to be portable\" does concern me. While it will always be plugged in, I will be taking it from school to home, etc.",
  "\\*\\*\\*why do you believe it's not portable? Is the P17 at risk because it's being moved around, or are you thinking it's large/heavy/etc. which makes it hard and annoying to move around. Thanks.",

But according to notebookcheck.com the i7 11800H version weighs aroud 3.6 kg. \nI think it would be fine for one trip to school and back but personally I don't know if it would be fun or healthy to lug this thing from classroom to classroom.",

There is very little (or nothing) that the P53 can do that the P1 G2 can't. You would need to be doing really extreme 3D modeling or rendering for the P53 to be a better choice. The P53 trades some mobility for expandability since it has four RAM slots and three hard drive bays.",

  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",

  "Nice review! Would you mind sharing how the Aura's screen compares to the SL7 you previously had? And how the fan noise in the SL7 was for you in the same setup you mentioned with external monitor?",
  "Thanks for this insightful review.\nRegarding the fan noise, is it possible to use tpfancontrol (or more recent) to customise it ? On both T15 (Gen 1) and L14 they work well to start the fan sooner than the firmware does, but I do not know whether it is possible to delay the fan startup...\nThanks,\nP.S. : additional question : what is the lowest rpm that tpfancontrol can achieve ?",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",

I usually connect it to my phone’s hotspot (an S23 Ultra), and when I tested it with Ookla Speedtest, the download speed never exceeded 180 kb/s (0.18 Mb/s), while the upload speed reached up to 4 Mb/s. It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do? I bought this from BestBuy in the U.S., but I’m currently not in the United States.

As a person constantly suffering from eye strain, you've made me aware of the importance of looking beyond just the basic screen specs. In this case, this laptop is an absolute no-go for me based on your experience. I am wondering if iPads suffer from the same problem.

  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues. And if anyone has solved the above issues i'd like to know how to fix it. (I tried bloat removal and even windows reinstall but the issue still persists)",

In my opinion if the G16 are a 10, the Aura speakers are a 9.5. I also feel the browsing experience to be much better on the Aura. I experience more lag on the G16 and the fans kick on, the SOC can get too hot for the G16 to sit on the lap, even with light browsing. That being said the track pad on the G16 is better. while the keyboard on the Aura is much better",

Also, the bass resonates across the laptop body which creates a weird sensation if you're typing while listening to music.

I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve. The chassis would get way too warm in heavier tasks and the fan would hardly do anything. But still, I prefer the SL7's acoustics. No noise in a docked setup.",

If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far.

Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully.

Basically, when using an external monitor either through HDMI or USB-C, the dedicated GPU will always be used to power new apps/processes. When you unplug the monitor, the processes continue running on the dedicated GPU. \"\n\nSo this means that heat and noise will continue to be generated by the dedicated gpu even when it's not needed at all.\n\nI run Linux on my laptops but maybe it's the same issue there.

  "Reviews or opinions of the lenovo thinkpad l380 My university gave me a grant that fully covers a [Thinkpad L380] (https://cci.unc.edu/product/lenovo-thinkpad-l380-ns/) and 4 years of insurance and warranty. I haven't been able to find reviews on it anywhere, and I don't want to use my grant without knowing how it's going to perform. The build appears to look cheap and I don't want to waste the grant on something that might break easily when I can use the grant better built laptop and pay the rest out of pocket.

  "Lenovo thinkpad E470 review! Just got this stunner of a thinkpad for $1000 CAD! Had for about a month so I decided to write a review as there are not many online.\n\n\n\nSPECS:\n\n\n-i7-7500U processor (3.4GHz turbo) with Intel 620 graphics\n\n\n-Geforce 940MX GPU (2GB DDR3)\n\n\n-8GB RAM (DDR4)\n\n\n-256GB OPAL2 compatible SSD\n\n\n-Intel 8264AC Wifi card\n\n\n-14 inch 1920x1080 IPS display (matte)\n\n\nI found this system to be quite nippy and responsive. I didn't expect Crysis at 60FPS ultra 1080p. Nor did I expect 75 degrees average temps in heavy loads! Cooling was good enough for me to overclock by a touch and still got 77 degree temps on average.\n\n\nCPU and GPU is enough for any light game at 1080p and medium settings. Harder games require lower resolution but still playable. Games like rocket league and CS:GO run well enough for casual play. Don't expect much, but its much better than integrated graphics by a long shot.\n\n\n\nBUILD QUALITY\n\n\nThe reason I bought Lenovo, the EPIC build quality. This is a $600 CAD laptop that is specced out, but still the same chassis as the $600 model...\n\n\nIts remarkable. Almost NO flex on the chassis and keyboard are. Absolutely no flex if you don't deliberately look for it. Low screen flex and a solid hinge make this feel premium, even though it is an entry-level model. \n\n\nKeyboard is a legend... No words can express how good this feels to type with. I got my blackwidow TE sitting in front of me, for my desktop PC. Yet I'm writing this review on the E470... Its good travel mixed with tactile feel, low/no flex... Words can't describe the feeling but my 101 WPM average on typeracer can!\n\n\nTHE LAYOUT! Worried about some weird layouts and key locations, there is none of that. The keys are FULLY spaced, no tiny keys on this keyboard. Big arrow keys with dedicated page up/down keys make navigation a breeze...\n\n\nSPEAKING of navigation, the trackpoint is on point here... Sorry for puns but the trackpoint is good for quick navigation in word files or browsers. I use it extensively in place of a mouse for coding and enjoy how seamless it really is. Accuracy and speed are good, although practice is needed. The buttons underneath is unothadox but loved. Kinda mushy buttons on the touchpad but deep travel and no wobble. The position is great for typing long series of text (Like this review)\n\n\nThe touchpad is good, not great but not bad. It kinda skips to the side if i click occasionally but gestures and scrolling are on point. The clicks get stiffer the higher up you get, annoying but standard. The size is decent but could be taller and wider. The palm rejection is good, but rarely is needed due to its smaller size. \n\n\nThe screen is good. Solid resolution of 1080p. Bright enough with matte display for outdoor use. Colors are a little weak but if you are not a hardcore designer or photoshop warrior, it won't be noticed. Scaling is bad out of the box and needed a couple minutes to get right. Overall not bad for the price.\n\n\nIO is also decent. Learn from this thing apple! 3 USB ports (1 always on 3.0, 1 3.0 and 1 2.0), HDMI (1.4), ethernet, combo jack and SD card reader. Good enough for a screen (also the graphics card helps as you can actually use external high res screens), a mouse (though trackpoint is good), external hard drive/USB. Power input is solid, does not take much force to pull out and the brick is pretty small. Charges VERY quickly, perfect for those on the go!\n\n\nSpeakers are good, a little lacking in bass but enough for watching youtube videos and movies. The indluded dolby audio system is quite capable of sounding great, requirigng no manual tuning.\n\n\n \nBATTERY LIFE/POWER\n\n\nI tweaked many settings around until I got the perfect configuration. Standard battery life is about 8 hours doing web stuff with no GPU, WiFi on, bluetooth on and about 60% brightness. With full load, battery is about 2 hours. Not bad at all! With undervolting and underclocking, I can manage 9 and a half hours of general use. When gaming the system overclocks to about 3.4GHz with NO thermal throttling, GPU is a toasty 80 degrees. \n\n\nNoise is pretty quite. On normal web usage, I hear nothing. SSD also helps this sound like a stealth fighter. When gaming, if you have a headset on, you won't hear this at all. There is only one cooling fan... It gets a little loud. Heat is not bad with 75-degree averages when under loads. The surface is warm but never too hot to touch. \n\n\n\nSOFTWARE\n\n\nHappy to report not much bloatware. Macafee trail run(BOOO!) can be removed easy. The included Lenovo apps SHOULD count as bloatware... But are actually quite useful! \n\n\nTL;DR: Great build quality, specs and value for the price. Lack of Thunderbold 3/Type C is a big con for many. The fit and finish is above and beyond expectations. The keyboard alone would be a selling point. Decent battery life. Decent screen. ",

  "Well done review!",
  "This review actually helped me decide to buy one at the beginning of the month. Unfortunately I sent it back to Lenovo today. The CPU throttling was terrible. I didn't buy it primarily as a gaming laptop, but I had that function in mind when I purchased it. Nearly any game I ran that wasn't CSGO and CPU usage over 50%...it would throttle down to 1.5Ghz the instant it hit 91c and pretty much stay there until the program was shut down. I think the problem is the fan in there doesn't go high enough. I was able to force it to max speed using the Thinkpad fan control app to see if it would make a difference when running prime95 & furmark. Kept temps in line and CPU speed held 2.9Ghz without a sweat. Of course, I can't leave it at that setting each time I want to do anything CPU intensive.\n\nIt's too bad, I really like this laptop otherwise. I had the exact same configuration except swap the SSD for the HDD. The number pad was really good for the work I do as its keys are full size. Made number crunching almost enjoyable.",

  "3070 with 4k UHD? Crazy deal that is.",
  "3070 is more than enough and lenovo thinkpads last almost a lifetime. If you don't play games, then the decision is pretty easy and even the 3070 will handle all games easily and doesn't need as much electricity.",
  "Thinkpad",
  "The Thinkpad.",
  "1080p resolution is pretty bad for CAD. Quadro 5000 (not A5000) is twice slower than 3070 (CUDA cores). 10850H is older than 11850H. 3 kg is heavier than 2 kg. \n\nRemind me, why exactly Precision is your second choice? It does not seem to have any benefits.",
  "none of them, go with P series thinkpads(they are designed specifically on that) if CAD application wise.",
  "As much as I hate thinkpads, the 3070m is on par with the qr5000m and 4K is so nice. Keep in mind the X1 Carbon is a thin wheat slims laptop and it will certainly start to heat up without even using it, seeing how the same cpu and a T1200 behaves in windows the 3070 isn’t going to be fun to hold.",
  "The precision is not really meant to be moved daily as it’s a desktop replacement machine. It’s solid but also heavy. As a student, I would go for the x1 extreme despite the lower thermal performance.",
  "If you are a heavy CAD user and don't plan to use it docked much, you will probably miss having a numpad if you are used to working with one already. \n\nI have a precision 7760 as a company computer, its really solid but an absolute monster to drag around between the office and home, backpacks are heavy with it and the charger isn't small either. The battery is also abysmal, but I almost always use it docked, it's 3 years old and I didn't have any battery protection settings (charge to 80% or whatever). I do really like the all aluminium chassis, it feels very solid and premium and I think it has pretty solid cooling for a laptop (though I don't have any software I can view temps with). I also can't really use it if I'm traveling for work, it trips any plane outlet instantly with its 240w brick... \n\nI own a precision 5550 as a personal computer and it amazes me how much sleeker it is to work with, but it is obviously somewhat less powerful and I do really miss the numpad. A 17\" feels just large enough to be comfortable doing significant CAD work on, but still I do 90% of my job with the computer docked and acting as a desktop. I can work on a 15\" but its a little cramped. I am really happy with it as an option, not my only one though. \n\n\nI think either could do ok for you, it really depends how intensive your work will be and how long term you plan to be doing a lot of CAD. Personally, I like a lot about my 7760 but I do not like lugging it around, if I were only doing \"college level CAD\" (your typical semester of learning solidworks, creo, whatever) you don't need that crazy of a computer. In that case and no interest in gaming I would rather be carrying around a capable ultrabook like my precision 5550 or an equivalent thinkpad. It actually has a usable battery, it's so much easier to live with in a backpack/on my lap, but on the other hand I really miss a numpad (also USB c only ugh) and while it's functional for basic design work, it isn't quite as snappy and I wouldn't want to use it for really complex CAD or other personal engineering tasks I do like 3d scanning (very demanding).\n\nI think either set of specs is adequate performance wise, both cpus are ok, both GPUs are overkill for basic CAD, though I will say I am often using more than 32gb ram, I could survive with it if I had to for basic CAD.",
  "Lenovo over Dell anytime. Pretty much anything over Dell.",
  "I'd go with the Precision in this case, better Cooling, more GPU VRAM (fucking 16GB!!! Bro) and I personally love the Quadro series graphics card, and yes more RAM 64gigs... The touch screen display is kinda like a bonus and Idc about the 4k or 1080p cuz you won't feel much difference when you'll be busy rendering and focusing on your work... Moreover, if you want the 4k vibe... Just plug the HDMI to any 4k monitor and you're good...",

  "Having had a Precision as a work pc for three years, I'd take the Thinkpad if the specs are sufficient for your needs. I really dont miss carrying that brick around.",
  "Thinkpad! \nThat off center trackpad on the precision is nasty",
  "On one hand, the Quadro RTX 5000 mobile has the optimized driver support for CAD programs - which would in all likelihood push it above the 3070 in Solidworks (***Specificallly Solidworks***), It's otherwise going to be outmatched in Blender, Premier Pro and After Effects in comparison.\n\nAgain, I need to stress that Solidworks performance would be the main selling point in favor of the precision.

  "College engineering projects will not requre legacy Quadro-class GPUs or extra-large VRAM (unless you plan on doing some light AI works too), so RTX 3070 will do nicely and it will be generally faster thanks to larger number of Cuda cores. \n\nNow, 4k display will draw more power which decreases battery life, but there is no laptop to have both advanced GPU and long battery life simultaneously.\n\nNow, if you really want modern pro-grade card, you can get a Thinkpad with A5000 on ebay - there are plenty.

  "But is it really better then the 64gb ram 16gb vram Dell?",
  "Interesting. No, I was not aware of that. Maybe I will try on my personal ultrabook without numpad, but I'm not sure I'd be happy as all the rest of the keyboard is staggered, nothing would be labeled (only an initial issue, but sounds meh) and I do keep a lot of letter keys assigned as hotkeys in CAD programs and use them extensions to reduce mouse usage.",

  "ok so you're saying P16 good, but P16s and P16v bad?",
  "Do you have something constructive to add?",
  "Yes. P16 benefits from things like the best gpu of the current series, gpu is removable (Dell’s DGFF) and swappable without soldering, just a better laptop. The latter are just T16’s in disguise.",
  "in what way what I said is not constructive \n\nYou could have no clue and easily distinguish between those two which is better built.

  "In the way that before the edit your comment was two letters and a punctuation.\n\n... \n\nAnd I would still take ThinkPad with wastly inferior specs over a Dell. Precisions may be better built than the rest of Dell's lineup, but ThinkPads have 27 years of reputation for indestructibility to them and I have personally experienced 19 of them without so much as a wobbly connector, and that is with daily backpacking abuse. They may not be the cheapest or the most powerful, but they sure do carry their own weight all the way  - unlike virtually any other laptop out there.",
  "the dell precision was released the same year in 1992\n\nif you have experienced so many thinkpads then wouldn’t it mean that they break faster/get obsolete faster since all people with a precision I know only had one or two \n\nThere’s a pretty insane cult like following around thinkpads which I was part of for a few until I realized they were probably the worst you could get for your money and still had issues, most IT professionals I’ve talked to actually hate dealing with them",
  "Lenovo Service Tech here.\n\nModern ThinkPads aren't anywhere close to what they used to be. Lenovo peaked with the T430 and dropped off significantly after the T480. Past that, and it's little more than one failed USB-C/Slim-Fit charging port after another because somewhere along the way, Lenovo forgot how to make a charging circuit.\n\nDell's in a similar boat, but that's not saying much as Dell's glory days were around the T430's time to begin with. However, a Precision really isn't likely to be any better or worse than a P-Series of equivalent year, they're both \"meh\", Lenovo just does a far better job standing behind their product when something breaks.",
  "It means I bought each of them refurbished at a fraction of the original cost, used a couple of years and still sold some of them for decent bump for the next one. Yes, they are generally not on par in the performance per dollar department, whether new or used. They more than make up for it by not falling apart as soon as the warranty ends.",

I’m going through BB because I have their premium membership which includes free geek squad repair/support. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on Dell?

Unless you expect to be dealing with video files (I regularly get 100's of gbs of body camera footage to analyze each month), 512gb storage should be enough. \n\nYou will want an external blu-ray burner so you can archive/back-up your files and for sharing discovery with outside counsel. As far as monitors, I suggest you get a single 32\" or larger display. If you somehow need more screen real estate, you can leave the screen open on the PC when it's docked.\n\nAs far as a dock, get a Thunderbolt dock, so you have a single cable going into your laptop that includes power.\n\nSince you're buying this for firm work, have the firm just spec and order it from HP or Lenovo.

  "Why are you worried about cooling system..? What exactly are you running where that becomes a problem? Also you don’t need a gpu, which will instantly save you money. Are you sure you’re getting it for usage as a *CS student* and not as a gamer/diff major..? 🤨",
  "The legion has an OLED screen, when comparing the rest of the specs it’s pretty equal so i would go for the Legion",

  "I am worried about cooling because the climate in the country I live in is very hot in summer at an average of 35°C (95°F) and could reach 40°C (104°F), so yeah cooling is VERY important. Some of my friends warned me that the motherboard could burn from the CPU's high temperature especially the CPUs' that end with HX.\n\nAnd true, as a CS student I won't really need a GPU, but I want to get into parallel processing especially CUDA, which would require a Nvidia GPU. I might also run some AI workloads or light AI models, some 3D, and PCB designing, which would also need a GPU or at least benefit from it.\n\nIt doesn't mean that I might not game on it from time to time 👀.",

  "idk man can give my opinion on that its subjective",
  "Thanks",
  "I dont think your college or wherever you're going to will like you using AI generates code, additionally to my knowledge it allows for the security vulnerability labelled as a feature called \"Recall\" and perhaps more issues down the line.\n\nThey literally planned for recall to be entirely unencrypted, stored on your drive, and opt-out. Luckily public backlash knocked enough sense for them to encrypt it, but its the same issue with Unity where its not trustworthy anymore.",
  "They’re literally workstation laptops with up to an Intel Xeon processor",
  "I can, but I will have to buy a product key. The left just skips the hassle and the extra cost",
  "From what I have heard the legion lineup has a great cooling system maybe even better than the asus tuf lineup\n\nI am also heading to the 3rd year, good luck with your studies too!",
  "This is the first time I hear about security vulnerabilities regarding NPUs, but couldn't they patch these vulnerabilities with updates? And are these vulnerabilities catastrophic or is the chance for this to happen is small?",
  "I believe recall is only available to \"Copilot+ PC\" branded computers. I don't think either of these are copilot+ PCs.",
  "Sorry my bad, they are not really available in my country so the ones I saw were trash",
  "Its not the NPUs themselves, its the features which they add utilising the NPUs. Recall as I said was first made to store screenshots of what you do on your computer (as well as passwords, documents, etc) UNENCRYPTED and by default..",
  "Go on eBay although the shipping might be like 500 bucks so watch out for that",
  "Is there a way to make them encrypted, or should I just avoid NPUs as you suggested?",
  "Nah, I am not paying 500 bucks for just the shipping😭\n\nMy budget is around 1500 bucks",
  "As I have said in one of my previous comments, due to public backlash they have now encrypted it, however due to their stupidity with this feature, I wouldn't particularly trust devices with Recall capability (Recall requires NPUs)\n\nOtherwise, the laptop with the NPU chip is better, but again can later gain vulnerabilities with updates",

  "Haha just a cliclbaity title. People usually respond to negatives rather than positives.\n\nUltimately, I did my research, and I settled on this as I believe it, Will be somewhat future proof. I plan on using it for coding and video editing.  So my biggest concern is the fact that it doesn’t have a dedicated GPU and potentially the battery life and thermals, but I’m not too worried about the GPU because I don’t mind waiting for stuff to render and the integrated GPU is top of the line, so it can handle light gaming and video rendering. \n\nMy biggest goal, for this post is to hear other peoples experiences, feedback, perspectives on this brand and specification of laptop, in relation to others on the market. \n\nThe biggest factor that played apart in my decision was build quality, and from what I could tell Lenovo does a good job.

  "Nah, the resource efficiency isn’t worth it for a beast like that",
  "The main difference between IPS and OLED is that IPS uses a white backlight, which shines completely white lights over a color filter to show different colors, whereas OLED (organic light emitting diode) has a whole lot of pixels which emit their own lights (meaning no white backlight).\n\nThis means that the OLED display can simply turn off pixels that need to show black, which in-turn shows much deeper black colors than the IPS panels, which also means it has better battery life as well. \n\nAlthough there are a some cons with OLED displays as well which is why laptop manufacturers like using IPS displays instead.",
  "There's  a risk with burn in with OLED displays. But in newer panels isn't that much of a deal, but the risk is still there. I rather mini led or ips over OLED.",

  "Noooooooooo!!! The less, I know the better! \n\nSeriously, though, you are a pro at explaining that concept. Thank you so much for teaching me. The difference. I’m gonna look up what type of drawbacks OLED displays have. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase because regardless if OLED is better, IPS is tried and tested and I don’t intend on using this for gaming and just kind of want to maximize my hardware, so I don’t feel any bottlenecks during my workflow. Thank you so much for teaching me about oled!",
  "OLEDs drain your battery. The tiny pixels illuminating individually are much less efficient then the backlight, unless you're pretty much always looking at very dark screens. I unfortunately, made the choice to go for OLED on my P14s and I've regretted it ever since. Also don't forget about the crappy OLED life. OP made the best choice with the high quality IPS display and that'll actually last him 10 years or more.",

Never had any issues with their warranty or support personally.\n\nI use Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Premiere, AiArty Image Enhancer and Video Enhancer, Adobe PDF Editor, MS Office apps, a little bit of gaming once in a blue moon.\n\nI suggest you buy it from HIDevolution and choose the Tuning and Optimization option located towards the bottom of the laptop configurator if you want the maximum performance and privacy, it makes a significant difference!",
  "Mini LED is the technology, so you have QHD Mini LED and 4K MiniLED. If I had to choose between QHD MiniLED or IPS 4K, I'd go with the Mini LED QHD without thinking twice. The color vibrancy and punch are on a whole different level, and you don't get any IPS Glow (you know when the corners of the screen look a bit brighter than the rest of the screen).\n\nAdditionally, I prefer QHD resolution because it provides the best performance to eye candy. You see, screens look best at their native resolution and if you're using a 4K screen on a laptop, which has a much smaller screen than a conventional monitor, at the native resolution, things would look super small so you have to choose DPI Scaling which artificially enlarges icons and text so that you can see them. The problem with that is that some programs don't play well with DPI Scaling and might display misaligned text/buttons or look blurry. With QHD, that is not an issue, even if you apply a mild 125% DPI Scaling compared to the 200-250% DPI scaling needed to make a 4K screen even visible.",
  "Thank you!  I did look at buying from them but way price alone was much higher even without adding stuff!  Thank you!",
  "Wow you are my hero!  Gonna start shopping today!  Thx!",
  "That's because they don't just grab a box that they got from the manufacturer and send it to you, only for you to discover it has dead pixels, overheating, or things not working. They do a full quality control check and you can configure the laptop to your liking in terms of storage, enhanced cooling, and most importantly, the tuning and optimization + you get lifetime tech support for free.\n\nIf you send them an email with your reddit account they have a 50 USD discount.",
  "Client asking for the impossible? I typically deploy Lenovo ThinkPads (T series, or P series).\n\nClient has a couple of users that we are replacing laptops for, but they say they want:\n\n - portable (14\" is ok, but must not be bulky)\n\n - touch screen\n\n - good speakers\n\nThey say they don't want to use external speakers because they don't have enough room on their workspaces at home, plus they are mobile and don't want to bring speakers with them. Much of their work is meeting with clients over Teams/Zoom.\n\nAs someone who manages these PCs, I want something with good warranty and servicability. I like ThinkPads becuase I can have warranty work done onsite with good response time.\n\nI'm leaning towards getting ThinkPad T series again, and just suggesing they use a headset and/or a clip on sound bar, but I don't think they will be satisfied.\n\nAre there any Dell or HP models that would be similar but with better sound, that could still have warranty repairs done onsite with decent response time?\n\nFinally, whatever alternative we choose cannot break the bank.

  "Did I Make a Huge Mistake? Lenovo Slim 3 vs ASUS TUF A15 — Need Advice! I just bought a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15AMN8. My goal was to get a professional 14' laptop for work, but one that could also handle games like PES 21, FIFA 23, and maybe  eFootball 2026 and the FIFA 2026 for  online play( I wanna have options) . I’m not a heavy gamer, I mainly played eFootball on mobile, but I got tired of the gameplay and decided to switch to a laptop.\n\nThe Lenovo Slim 3 cost me €528, plus a warranty that brought it to around €700. However, I started second-guessing my choice when I saw the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 priced at €869. I want a laptop that still looks professional for work, but I wouldn’t mind paying the extra €270 for noticeably better performance. The specs of the ASUS A15 are shown in the second photo.\n\nWhat do you all think? Did I make the right choice with the Lenovo, or should I return it and go for the ASUS TUF A15 instead?

  "Will the ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2025) Handle My Workload ArcGIS Pro + AutoCAD & Tons of Multitasking? I am looking for a laptop to use as a workstation in case I need to provide my own equipment in the future. I am a Design Engineer working with Aerial & Underground fiber optics in the Telecom field. I mainly use ArcGIS Pro & AutoCAD for drafting & designing routes. While I have one of those programs open, I also must have MS Teams, MS Outlook, MS Excel, Adobe Acrobat, Google Earth Pro, 2 to 3 File Explorer folders, plus a web browser running Katapult + Katapult Photo + Katapult Map + Client Engineering Support Platform + Sharepoint + Smartsheet (around 6-7 tabs depending on Google Earth Pro/Google Maps) all running at the same time. I can get away with Google Maps most of the time. Long story short heavy multi tasking processing is a must.\n\nI do not know much about the difference between AMD & Intel processors but from what I have heard AMD excels at multi tasking & Intel is better at running single tasks. Please correct me if any technical information is wrong. Things have evolved a lot since I last purchased a laptop a decade ago for college.\n\nMy current position supplied me a laptop I am very happy with. Here are the specs:\n\nDell Precision 5690\n\nIntel Core Ultra 7 155H (3.80 GHz)\n\n32 GB RAM Speed 7467 MT/s\n\n1 TB SSD\n\n128 MB Intel Arc Graphics\n\n16 inch touchscreen\n\nI have had bad experiences with the Dell I used throughout high school. After having it serviced 7 or 8 times because of the cheap plastic hinge, I replaced it with an all metal Asus in 2017 when I started college. Here are those specs:\n\nASUS Q504UA\n\nIntel Core i5 7200U (2.5 GHz)\n\n12 GB RAM Speed 2133 MHz\n\n1 TB SSD\n\n128 MB Intel HD Graphics 620\n\n15.6 inch touchscreen 2 in 1\n\nEven though I had bad experiences with Dell in the past, this Precision 5690 is really nice. I like the all metal design for the shell & hinges. My only problems with it is that I have yet to see them go on sale and I hate that it only has USB C ports. The XPS goes on sale from time to time but I do not know if that will give me what I need.\n\nAfter doing research the unanimous answer from coworkers, gamer friends, the internet, & even AI was that the bare minimum I need is 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, an AMD Ryzen 7 or 9 / Intel Core Ultra 7 or 9 / Intel Core i7 or i9 processor, & a dedicated graphics card. Preferably I want something that has an extra RAM slot & an extra M.2 slot so that I can upgrade RAM & storage in the future.\n\nI pulled an all nighter last night going through all of the Best Buy Black Friday deals trying to find THE ONE. I narrowed it down to Lenovo, & Asus. I ended up with three options: Lenovo Yoga 9i Pro, Lenovo Legion Pro 5, & the ASUS ROG Strix G16. All three had 16 inch screens but the Yoga got kicked out because it does not have expandable RAM or storage. That left the Legion Pro & Strix G16. I watched a ton of review & comparison videos, checked rtings, & I think I finally did it. I chose the ASUS ROG Strix G16 based on my personal preferences, AMD over Intel processor, & the nail in the coffin was my childhood friend’s recommendation plus his father’s recommendation. They preferred Asus over Lenovo. His fathet owned a Legion Pro, the best Alienware 16 inch, & recently switched to the Strix G16 & loves it. The only difference between my choice & his is that mine has the RTX 5070 while his has the RTX 570Ti, which in my opinion is not worth the extra 800 dollars which is the current difference with the black friday sale favoring mine.\n\nHere are the specs for the winner:\n\nASUS ROG Strix G16\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9000 9955HX3D (2.5 GHz with boost up to 5.4 GHz)\n\n32 GB DDR5 RAM (5600 MHz)\n\nExtra SO DIMM slot (tool free)\n\n1 TB SSD PCIe 4.0\n\nExtra M.2 slot (PCIe Gen 5 ready)\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 with 8 GB GDDR7\n\n16 inch 2.5K 240 Hz 3 ms Nebula Display\n\nNow here are my questions for you all:\n\n1) Will this do what I need it to do?\n\n2) Do these laptops last or will it brick in a few years?\n\nI plan on babying this laptop if that helps.\n\n3) Is 20% off the best sale I am going to find for a current generation ROG Strix G16?\n\n4) Do I need an external cooling pad or fan? If not needed, would you still recommend one, & if so which one works best with this laptop?\n\nThis is going to be my personal computer that can double as a workstation if I need it. The fact that it is a gaming laptop is a plus for when I finally make the switch from console. I like the fact there are 2 x USB-A 3.2 in addition to the the 2 x UBS-C ports. I do not know if I will ever be a full PC person since I like being able to move around, laptops are my power meets portability. My job tried to give me a computer but I declined as I visit family and a tower is not a realistic option for me to travel with.\n\nI am sure this is probably way too much information & I might be making too big of a deal out of this. This thing will probably do everything I need & more. I just like doing my homework before sinking a grand or more into something. Buying a new car took years & the only reason I finally did it was because squirrels totaled my old one.\n\nThanks for your help guys and gals I really appreciate it!",
  "Honestly, think about if you actually NEED a laptop. With this budget you can build a WAY faster desktop.\n\nPersonally, I'd build an equivalent desktop which would save some cash, sell my current laptop and use that money to buy like a 4050 laptop.\n\nYou'd have a capable workstation at home, and a machine to get you by during the day.\n\nThat's of course if you don't NEED portability at all times. \n\nIf you do, this should be fine. I know a engineer who uses a RTX 2060 laptop for work to this day. And my dad's company (which is for construction), had some similarly powerful workstations a few years ago.\n\n\n\nTldr; This is fine, but if possible get a desktop + a reasonable laptop, for your use-case.",
  "I would say get intel, it had a lot more cores then amd, but in all fairness the laptop should be enough for all of your tasks, 32gb might not be enough so consider upgrading, but i think you should get the laptop",
  "I appreciate your feedback. I actually did think about it. Right now I'm doing well in my position, just was getting worried about the future. I have that ASUS that still works, & a back up Lenovo that was a hand me down to replace the eye sore that was my old Dell. The 2 in 1 ASUS got me through college using AutoCAD, Inventor, ArcGIS, & Solidworks. I don't think I need a new laptop (or desktop), I may have just been giddy at the prospect of getting a deal. I am a sucker for deals & have been known to be impulsive not to miss out on them. The deal is good for 1 more day so I'm going to sleep on it again tonight, but more than likely I may not move forward on it right now. As long as things are going well with work I don't need a personal work station. If I do need it in the future I will have done all this research & it will be an easier ordeal not having to start from scratch. \n\nThank you for your candor!\n\nEdit: I slept on it. I did some more research based on the other person's comment I looked for more comparison videos between the Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 U9 275HX & AMD Ryzen 9 9000 Series 9955HX3D on the ROG Strix G16 (2025). Based on that research I've decided to move forward on my purchase but have switched from the AMD to the Intel processor since the Intel model is newer, has an improved chasis,  & has a lot of newly improved features that support more future proofing and quality of life than the older AMD model. \n\nI am not a desktop kind of guy, portability is more important to me than strictly power & perfomance. I understand PC will outperform & be lower cost when compared to laptops. Also having both isn't a realistic option for me, it would be one or the other. My personal preference or bias is laptop > desktop.",
  "I did more research after posting & it looks like you were right. JarrodsTech compared the Intel & AMD versions. The Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 U9 275HX model came out ahead of the AMD Ryzen 9 9000 Series 9955HX3D in most cases. It also has easier access to the internals with a pull tab instead of 12 plus screws just to remove the bottom panel. The Intel model supports the next generation PCIe 5 for future proofing on both SSD ports whereas the AMD only supports PCIe 5 on 1 of 2. The Intel version includes 3 USB A ports where as the AMD only has 2 USB A ports. They have the same number of USB C ports but the port speeds are faster on the Intel than on the AMD model. The Intel also has WiFi 7 compared to WiFi 6 on the AMD.\n\nThe Intel model looks better with the 360° RGB, & it runs cooler thanks to the updated vapor chamber design. It also uses liquid metal & cools both the CPU & GPU, while the AMD version only cooled the GPU. The Intel also support facial recognition whereas the AMD does not. The Intel was more energy efficient and has a 29% longer battery life when compared to the AMD.\n\nI really appreciate your comment because it pushed me to dig deeper and helped me make a better informed decision. I was close to skipping a laptop upgrade this year, but based on Jarrod’s testing & how this newer Intel model performs and looks, I have changed my mind & am going to stop by BestBuy after work today to go ahead and place my order!\n\nIn case you wanted to see the comparison video I was talking about here is the link to it.

  "I just realized in the checkout that the Intel has the RTX 5060 GPU (the 5070 is available but at a +$400 price hike) vs AMD which has the RTX 5070 GPU. The sale price between these 2 is exactly the same at 1,699. I'm thinking about sticking with the Intel because of the new and improved chasis, both M.2 SSD ports being PCIe Gen 5 compatible, improved cooling, ports, wifi, battery life, energy efficiency, and RGB.",
  "Buying a New Laptop for Black Friday Hey everyone,\n\nI used AI to help write this so it’s clearer, but the situation is mine. I’m pretty blind with this stuff and don’t have much idea what’s good anymore, so I’m relying on you all.\n\nI’ve been using a Dell Mobile Precision Workstation 5570 for about 3.5 years, and it’s started to lag. With Black Friday coming up, I’m thinking of upgrading to a high-end laptop and would love some guidance.\n\n**My current laptop (bought for around $3200 in 2022):**\n\n**Model: Dell Precision 5570**\n\n**CPU: Intel i9-12900H (vPro)**\n\n**GPU: NVIDIA RTX A2000 (8 GB)**\n\n**Age: \\~3.5 years**\n\nUse:\n\nMostly watching movies\n\nGaming: mainly Call of Duty, but I might get into more games in the future\n\nAs more of an afterthought: I might run Blender or some simulation/engineering software occasionally\n\nHad full warranty/support when I bought it\n\n\n\nWhat I’m looking for now:\n\nA high-end laptop with clearly better graphics performance than my current RTX A2000\n\nShould handle modern AAA games smoothly (would like to be able to play something like GTA 6 if/when it comes to PC)\n\nGood for movies/media\n\nBudget is flexible — I’m okay spending for something that will last\n\nI’d like an idea of typical prices before any Black Friday discounts\n\nOpen to both gaming laptops and workstation-style laptops\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. What specific laptops would you recommend for someone who mainly watches movies and plays CoD, but wants room to expand into more games and maybe light Blender/sim work?\n\n2. Should I go for a gaming-focused machine (Alienware, Razer, ASUS ROG, Lenovo Legion, etc.) or stick with a workstation (Dell Precision, Lenovo P series, etc.)?\n\n3. Roughly how much money should I expect to spend before discounts for a clear upgrade over my current setup?\n\n4. If anyone has upgraded from a Precision 5570 or something similar, what did you move to and how has it been?\n\nTL;DR:\n\nI’m pretty clueless about current laptops. My Dell Precision 5570 (i9-12900H + RTX A2000) is lagging after \\~3.5 years. I mostly watch movies and play Call of Duty, but might play more games and occasionally run Blender/simulation software. Budget is flexible. Looking for suggestions on what to buy next and what price range to expect before Black Friday discounts.",

  "Getting a new laptop through my work at a discounted price, looking for stylus note taking, modelling, gaming and office use. Help me choose \nI'm able to get one of these laptops through my workplace for a somewhat discounted price with a 3 year warranty. My main use case is going to be writing some notes on the device as a tablet with a stylus, lightish gaming, CAD and video editing. Then some general office and Uni work. So Clair Obscur is a game I want to play, some light modelling in blender maybe or autocad, and editing 1080p footage and possibly short 4k video in Da vinci. Any thoughts? May be able to get others a slightly lower cost than standard but curious to see what people think.

Very tempted by the Proart but not sure if the £800 extra over the MSI is justified for better specs. The Lenovo are more hoping the IGPU will be enough for me, instead being lighter for portability and better battery. Unfortunately can't find many reviews on the MSI, I know the 4050 isn't great but wondering it it'll do for me. Thanks.",

  "What does \"above 228V\" mean in this context?\n\nThe 13800HX might be faster or equally fast but is also far more power hungry. \n\nI recommend some power banks. Either an Anker or a Baseus Blade (for being flat)",
