  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience). I have a Lenovo duet 5 now which I love but the snapdragon is feeling a little long in the tooth when I have more than a few tabs open.\n\nI guess my heart says Lenovo but brain said MacBook Air.",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop. Having good speakers is a great bonus for the Lenovo for me, as well as a bright screen. Don't need maximum power as for heavy workload I want to rely on remote desktops.",
  "Check your local best buys, in my area (SE Michigan) the Lenovo is on BB as a used excellent for $530 which is the right price point. So see if you can find one in your area for that price",
  "Unfortunately not near me but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nWhat do you think the chances of the kompanio lasting close to apple silicon?",
  "Not sure, thats a ChatGPT quesiton lol \n\nHappy hunting, hopefully you can find one soon.   I hear that they are high-end Chromebooks with Spandragon x Elite processors coming; I'm hoping they are here just before the holiday season.",
  "Ended up with the m4 MacBook air. It went on sale on Amazon for 750(!) and I can't find the Lenovo near me. Also mixed in the surface laptop for fun but the air just seems too good. Thanks again for your help!",
  "Acer Chromebook Plus 714 Review - A Monarch in the making (for Chromebooks) I’ve long been a fan of Acer Chromebooks, mainly because they were one of the first companies that really took ChromeOS seriously and pushed out multiple devices at different price points so people could actually try the platform out. My very first Chromebook back in 2015 was an Acer (and I’ve owned four Acer Chromebooks since then). I loved that original device, even with its limitations in RAM and power at the time. But Acer has come a long way, and now I’ve got my hands on the new Acer Chromebook Plus 714. This one comes with a premium build, pure power, and unexpectedly great battery life.\n\nIt's not a “new release”, but it's the best Chrombook Acer makes, so I had to check it out as I'm on my journey to find the best new Chrombook for me. So let’s get into it.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmbbq2mxr6qf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d3134b2a3c13e924ed1043ba200030769b02d06\n\nThe design looks sharp. It has a premium feel with gold edges against the dark grey finish. The body is solid aluminum, and it really feels like a top-tier machine in hand. Inside, it switches to plastic, but not the cheap kind. It feels solid, comfortable under your palms and wrists, and there’s no flex when typing.\n\nPort selection is solid: two USB-C ports, an HDMI port (which should honestly be standard on every laptop), a headphone jack (another must-have), and USB-A ports. The downside is both USB-C ports are on the left side, which already caused me an issue with charging since my setup needed a right-side port. They could have easily put one on each side, and it feels like a miss.\n\nFor a device at this price, it should also have a fingerprint scanner, standard in my book for anything over $500, especially a Chromebook.\n\nOn the positive side, it’s a 360-degree convertible, so you can flip it into tablet or tent mode, which is surprisingly useful in tight spaces (like on a plane). But here’s the kicker: some versions of the 714 come with a built-in stylus, and mine didn’t. That should’ve been standard across all models at this price point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hr13bs3zr6qf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27f67b6daff371c0c5a569f5f774116c3d5c630e\n\n**Overall Design & Build: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nThis is always the question that unites man: how long does the battery last? The Chromebook Plus 714 runs on Intel’s new **Core Ultra 5 115U chip**, so I was curious how that would balance performance with efficiency. My past Chromebooks with i5 chips had horrible battery life.\n\nAt first, this one seemed the same, barely a few hours, and even dying overnight in sleep mode. But then, after a few days, something clicked. It optimized itself, and the battery life became excellent.\n\n**My normal workflow includes:**\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web) meets 4-5 hours a day\n* Google Messages app\n* YouTube Music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Brightness around 70%\n\nWith that, it pushes through the day, no problem. Even now in week 2, I charged it 5 days ago, used it an hour or two daily, and it still has 43% left. Whatever optimization Intel and Acer did here worked, because my older HP Chromebook x360 14c with an i3 chip can’t even come close.\n\n**Battery Life: A**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nThe keyboard is good, but not great. I have massive “bearpaw” hands, so I judge every keyboard against the HP x360’s, which still holds the crown for me. This one is fine, with decent travel and good response, but the keys could be just a bit bigger.\n\nThe trackpad is excellent, glass-like, very responsive, accurate, and the perfect size. It does pick up fingerprints easily, but that’s par for the course.\n\nAgain, no fingerprint reader in 2025 for a device at this price range, big miss\n\n**Keyboard: B- | Trackpad: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\n# Speakers & Sound\n\nThis is where Acer cut corners. The speakers are weak, tiny, and honestly feel like they came out of a first-gen Chromebook. No bass, not loud, and just flat overall. Even my phone speakers (iPhone or Galaxy) blow these out of the water. At this price point, they should have borrowed the better speakers from their Windows laptops.\n\n**Speakers: D**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance - Intel Core Ultra 5 115U\n\nThis is the biggest surprise. The new Intel Core Ultra 5 architecture delivers real performance gains in a way I haven’t seen on a Chromebook before.\n\nUnlike the new Lenovo Chromebook with the hyped-up MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip (which stuttered constantly and almost crashed during 4K editing for me), this one handled everything I threw at it. With 20–30 tabs open, Teams in the browser, Zoom app running, and editing 4K video in **InShot**, it was smooth and lag-free. Exporting video was fast, and transitions, text, and clip movements were as fluid as they are on my Galaxy Tab S9+.   This chip also allows you to download all the apps from the Google Play store, something I also saw on the Lenovo, but to me I get better performance on this one.\n\nEven with only 8GB of RAM, it didn’t break a sweat. But at this price, I still think Acer should’ve put in 16GB for better future-proofing.\n\nNow, **benchmarks (JetStream and Speedometer)** only show mild improvements over my older HP x360 14c with an i3 from 2021, which is shocking. But in real-world usage, this chip feels much more powerful. Combined with the strong battery life, this is easily one of the best Chromebook chips out right now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nu5xd0z0s6qf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efa740e012bf81d7d2347cc7a25a3c92aeac6f6c\n\n**Performance: A+**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nThe screen is solid with a 16:10 aspect ratio, crisp visuals, accurate colors, and good brightness (rated at 340 nits, more than enough for outdoor use). It doesn’t quite pop like the Lenovo Chromebook Plus screen (that one I really felt like I was there watching an HDR video), but it’s plenty good for work and media.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/je6xl7k3s6qf1.jpg?width=2398&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=401798ec54a6fa5aea7f3e61b28bb62e825ec3d6\n\nThe camera, though, is excellent. It feels like using my Logitech webcam on Windows. It’s AI-enhanced, sharp in low light, and balanced in harsh light. Chromebooks used to skimp here, but this one really impressed me, even rivaling smartphone-level quality on calls.\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Acer Chromebook Plus 714 is a great machine and a clear look at where Chromebooks are headed with Intel’s Core Ultra chips. It’s sleek, powerful, has excellent battery life, and handles pretty much anything you throw at it within ChromeOS.\n\nFor most people who live in web apps (Docs, Gmail, YouTube, Office), this is exactly what you need. And honestly, people dropping $2,000 on “email machines” should be looking at ChromeOS more seriously.\n\nBut it’s not perfect. The missing fingerprint scanner, weak speakers, plastic interior, and lack of a stylus on all models really hold it back. At its original MSRP of $800, it was priced against the MacBook Air, and it’s not quite at that level yet. But at $629 (and even cheaper for open-box units at Best Buy), it’s an easy recommendation.\n\nRight now, this feels like royalty in the Chromebook lineup. Not quite the King yet, but very close. If they make the changes I mentioned, along with overall improvements due to tech available at the time, the 714 will easily be crowned King of Chromebooks. \n\n**Overall Grade: A**   \n**Excellent pickup.**",
  "I have one I bought two years ago.  One of the keys got stuck but I kind of unstuck it.  It's been good but when I tried to trade it in on this Lenovo, they told me they'd give me fifteen bucks for it so I kept it.  So now I have two chromebooks.  The Lenovo 14 Mediatek and the Acer 714 Spin",
  "You had the regular spin 714 not the plus, this model just came out in December. .but as I said about the keyboard it's not great, so I can see how it got stuck lol\n\nBest buy has the most offensive trade in numbers in the game lol",
  "mine when I bought it didnt say Plus on it but as soon as it got its update it was labeled plus.",
  "it was specked the same so they made it a plus.",
  "My review on Dell Inspiron 16 plus with RTX 3060 (60W) I got mine on Aug 04 2021 on a deal for only $1450. It comes with **i7-11800H, 32gb RAM, 3k display, 1TB SSD with RTX 3060 (60w), thunderbolt 4 and full size SD card slot**.\n\nBeing a professional video producer &amp; editor, I have been in search of excellent windows 4k RAW video editing laptop. I have bought tons of high end laptops in last couple of months and tried each of them with a real-time 4k RAW playback test &amp; 3 minute 4k timeline with multiple layers, color correction, effects, noise and infusions render test.\n\nThe best things about this laptop is the display. This is literally by far one of the most color accurate and sharp 3K display out there on the market. Everything looks darn amazing. The fans are on a bit louder side but you can keep it to quiet mode if you don't like it. But I think with performance mode the fans are understandable. Build quality is good but not great. The material is not XPS quality but it does feel premium. The overall look and design with 16 inch almost bezel less display is pretty awesome. As I prefer matter over glossy, this has clearly one of the sharpest screen on the market.\n\nThis laptop is tuned more towards creators for sure but obviously you can game on it too. But due to 60hz refresh rate this will not likely be a first choice for gamers.\n\nSo here is the real **render time** **result on Adobe Premiere Pro**:                                                                                                       (Prices may not reflect current pricing, these are the prices I bought it for)\n\n\\- **Dell Inspiron 16** plus i7-11800H, 32gb RAM, 3k display 1 TB SSD with RTX 3060 (60w) model = ***3 min 10 seconds*** : Price: $1450\n\n\\- **MacBook Pro 16\"** with 5600M, retina display, intel i9, 32GB RAM, 2 TB SSD  = ***3 min 47 seconds*** : Price: $3800\n\n\\- **Asus Zephyrus M16** RTX 3060, i9 -11900H, QHD, 16GB RAM, 1 TB SSD =  ***4 min 52 seconds***: Price: $1849.99\n\n\\- **Asus Zephyrus G14** with Ryzen 9 5900HS, FHD 144hz, RTX 3060, 16GB RAM, 1 TB SSD = ***4 min 24 seconds*** Price: $1449.99\n\n\\- **Asus Zephyrus G15** with Ryzen 9 5900HS,QHD, RTX 3070, 16GB RAM, 1 TB SSD = ***3 min 37 seconds*** Price: $1799.99\n\n\\- **Razerblade 15 4K OLED** with intel i7-10750H, RTX 2070 max-q, 16 GB RAM, 512GB SSD = ***5 min 38 seconds*** Price: $1699.99\n\n\\- (**Fastest**) **MSI Creator 15 4K UHD** with intel i7-10875H, RTX 2070 Super max-q, 32 GBRAM, 1 TB SSD = ***2 min 14 seconds*** Price: $1699.99\n\n\\- **Eluktronics Mech-15** with intel i7-10870H, FHD, RTX 2070 Super max-p, 16 GB RAM, 512 SSD = ***4 min 30 seconds*** Price: $1699.99\n\n\\- **Eluktronics Max-15** with Ryzen 7 4800H, QHD, RTX 3060 max-p, 32GB RAM, 1 TB SSD = ***3 min 10 seconds*** Price: $1599.99\n\nSo, if you look at the price value. Honestly, this laptop is a great buy. I think for creators, the 16:10 ratio with 3K resolution is the best part of the deal &amp; it does beat lot of high end laptops in playback and render time. There are several other reasons why I returned those laptops mentioned above( except this one) which is hard to explain all in here. But If you want to know, shoot me a message. I'll be happy to help.",
  "Thank you for sharing so much useful info! I’m signing up for Reddit to post this reply. One possible reason for what you observed could be Intel Quicksync doing some of the decode/encode assist. A quick way to validate is to turn iGPU off in bios or device manager. Another reason as you touched on in the comments is Premier optimization. Davinci Resolve Studio is much better at unleashing full GPU horse power. Do you mind sharing which raw codec do you work with? Also if you can post some Pudget benchmarks that would be really cool and standardized (they split by transcoding and effects etc). Thanks again for your post!",
  "Thanks for this!! Would you say it's worth getting the Inspiron 16 Plus over something like the Dell XPS 15 9510? I know the latter is the \"higher\" end laptop but it's processor doesn't seem significantly better than the Inspiron (i9-11900H vs i7-11800H), but the Inspiron's high end graphics card is much better (GeForce RTX 3060 vs the XPS's GeForce RTX 3050-Ti). \n\nI'm a graphic designer/video editor, so I'm looking for something that primarily has a good processor but also has a decent graphics card.",
  "This is a very useful comparison you’ve provided here. Thank you for that. \n\nI’m fairly inexperienced and unaware when it comes to multimedia creation tools and the hardware/software support intricacies. Besides just the wattage of the GPU and CPU, what other factors would influence the render time ? \n\nIs the fact that the Inspiron 16 Plus is able to outperform the G14 entirely due to thermals and wattage ? Or is there something else at play here too ? And how come the Creator 15 is the fastest of the lot, while having last-Gen hardware across the board ? From what I can see, the machines with 32GBs of RAM are the ones that perform the best here.",
  "Great post, thanks. One thing you could do for us all is to set up a Google drive with your project (in XML) and files to share so other people could test more machines and compare to yours? Thank you!",
  "Thanks for the great review! How’s the battery life when doing simple tasks?",
  "Great writeup! If you managed to open up the laptop, do you know whether the 1TB SSD comes in a 2230 or a 2280 form factor?  \nFrom what I see the laptop has [two PCIe slots for SSDs](https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/1/5/csm_MG_4491_f59cd10fbc.jpg), one 2230 and the other 2280.  \n2230 sizes are very difficult to find and a lot more expensive than 2280, so if Dell ships a 2230 by default then that's a great win.",
  "What is battery life in office work usage? Web browsing. Word , excel etc.",
  "Thanks for you insight as well. \n\nYes, I did turned off the iGPU and did the render. The result was same. I mostly shoot in Blackmagic RAW 4k. So, I have been using Da Vinci Resolve studio version a lot. And yes it completely uses GPU and it's a faster and better render program than Premiere pro.  Those tests on Premiere pro was for the office work as they have not moved to Da Vinci yet. \n\nThe pudget benchmarks are not working with Adobe suites at the moment. Whenever it is fixed I'll share it here on the post.",
  "And for my own experience, M1 8gb RAM Mac can export almost as quickly as my 2020 Asus G14 (2060mq) using a73 h264 footage, in Resolve Studio. M1 can even playback 8k h265 footage from Sony a1 in 4K timeline, while the G14 choke due to Nvidia h265 hardware decoder not as good as M1",
  "If you simply look at the graphics, yes RTX 3060 is better. But it’s not always the graphic card that makes your work flow easy. \n\nIf you decide to get all maxed out dell XPS 9510 vs Inspiron 16, then i would say 9510 would be a better choice. But if you want display, processor, graphic card with less money 💰 to spend then Inspiron 16 is better.",
  "I'll answer accordingly.\n\nMe and my colleague have been in frequent contact with Dave2D and JarrodTech on their discord channel. All of them are amazed on how MSI creator 15 outperformed all the high end laptops by miles on the test. Since I do tons of RAW video editing, I have made sure all the settings are perfectly matched and timed.\n\nSo to answer your question, after tons of test I found out, to render that level of RAW codecs with such speed CPU-GPU combination has to be perfectly compatible with each other and work in sync. When I monitored the CPU-GPU usage of MSI or Dell Inspiron 16 for that matter, during render, both were using almost 100% of their limitation of CPU & GPU at the same time while laptop like Asus M16 & Razerblade lacked that level of synchronization. Even manufacturers and engineers are not aware of those details because they only test the basic usage & thermal compatibility when building the machine & not the specific software usage. That's why most of the manufactures send their pre-unit to reviewers and let them test bunch of software on it and find out what works better and what not.\n\nSo, I came to know that it's not always a most powerful gaming laptop that beats the tests. It's the compatibility and the drivers that have been specifically optimized for the task outperforms the other. So laptops that are specifically designed for creators beats out other powerful gaming laptops on those test. I forgot to mention in my post that **MacBook Pro M1** with 16GB RAM & 512 SSD renders that same test in just **4 min 10 seconds** beating out some high end gaming machines. So, you see it's the optimization that works better when using apps like premiere pro and Macs are always known for their optimization of CPU-GPU with the applications.\n\nHonestly I don't have an exact answer to this question on why Dell Inspiron 16 plus was able to beat G14. As i7-11800H in dell is faster than Ryzen 9 5900HS & also Ryzen 9 5900HX which is insane,\n\n[*https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-11800H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HX/m1542191vsm1449683*](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-11800H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HX/m1542191vsm1449683)*)*,\n\nthat might be one reason. In programs like premiere pro, the program tries to render the video using CPU first. If CPU thinks it can handle the tasks then it'll render itself but if it thinks its too much then it'll send the task to GPU. So I think dell's optimized drivers for that application, CPU-GPU synchronization are superior to G14s when using adobe suites. But while gaming G14 will be better because it is optimized for gaming. That's only logical explanation I can think of.\n\nYes, more RAM is always better but in all the test, no render needed more than 16gb of RAM. 11gb-15gb was the maximum utilization during the render. But personally, I believe 32GB is the perfect choice for anything.\n\nI hope I answered your questions.",
  "Hey folks, got mine today, with rtx 3060, 1TB SSD NVMe and 16GB Ram. I just opened and... **Good news!**\n\nIt came configured as follows:\n\nThe **SSD1** slot admits up to **PCIe gen4** 2280 SSDs. The 1TB SSD installed on it is a **Western Digital 1TB PCIe gen3 x4** in **2230** format, mounted on a sub-bracket. The main bracket admits 2280 ssds and includes a termal strip.\n\nThe **SSD2** slot is free, and is labeled as PCIe 3.0 i.e. **gen3**, in **2230** format.\n\nI swaped the included 1TB 2230 gen3 SSD from the 2280 gen4 SSD1 slot to the 2230 gen3 SSD2 slot to free the 2280 gen4 slot. As the included Western Digital ssd is PCIe 3 anyway, its performance should stay the same.\n\nI'll see how it works, normally I should just change the main ssd in the Bios and that's it. I'll update my post as soon as I could do it.",
  "By the way, this is the SSD that came installed in mine:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/-/es/Western-Digital-SN530-2230-SDBPTPZ-1T00/dp/B08SL5GY19?language=en\\_US",
  "> So, I came to know that it's not always a most powerful gaming laptop that beats the tests. It's the compatibility and the drivers that have been specifically optimized for the task outperforms the other. So laptops that are specifically designed for creators beats out other powerful gaming laptops on those test.\n\ncould you please clarify - is this because of dell's hardware/drivers, or because of dell's proprietary software? i guess my real question is: would you get the same performance if you did a fresh windows installation but didn't install any dell-specific software",
  "Nice laptop. If you don't mind, may I ask how much you pay for it for the configuration you mentioned above?",
  "This is great news, thanks for sharing. Honestly the 16 Plus sounds like an amazing machine, can't wait to order mine. Btw I heard the hinges are a bit stiff on this model, is that true?  \nI remember that on my old Inspiron 7537 I had to loosen up the hinges after a few years. They would tighten up over time as you repeatedly open and close the lid. This risks breaking the screen frame.",
  "BTW no need to change anything on the bios. The system will still recognize the 1TB OS ssd as the primary, even if installed on the ssd2 slot. Today I added a 2280 2TB Samsung 970 evo plus on the ssd1 slot and everything's running fine",
  "Amazing, thanks! These are very expensive since the form factor is so niche. Currently about [£150 on Ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/274835097248), opened – never used. So taken from other laptops most probably.",
  "Actually that's a really interesting question. As far as my test goes, I believe dell has outperformed because of it's integrated software & drivers. Also Intel 11th gen processor is in play here. If it was solely based on hardware then Mech-15 with RTX 2070 Super Max-P (130W) on a Beast Mode which has way better hardware & still lost to dell's RTX 3060 Max-Q (60W).\n\nAlso MSI creator 15 (which outperformed every laptop I have tested) has a creator mode, which you can turn on & it adds adobe programs automatically in the lists. So I think, if you really wipe out everything on the Dell and install fresh windows we might see a different result. I'll try that some day and will update here.",
  "I paid 1442eur incl taxes at [dell.es](https://dell.es) for the highest configuration possible and still with Win10. I ordered it end of September and it came yesterday. The \"discounted\" prices are still available, even at 1420 now, though they already come with win11.\n\nhttps://www.dell.com/es-es/work/shop/port%C3%A1tiles-dell/nuevo-inspiron-16-plus/spd/inspiron-16-7610-laptop/bn76109",
  "The hinges are tight, but not stiff. I definitely can open the lid with one hand. That was not the case with my previous inspirons or vostros. Maybe because it's an all metal body",

  "Looking to buy new laptop under 1200 USD Hey Everyone,\n\nTLDR - \n\nLooking to Buy a reliable professional-grade laptop around 300,000 PKR with strong CPU performance, expandable RAM and SSD options, a capable GPU for rendering, decoding, and solid build quality. Preferably new with local warranty support.\n\nAny recommendations or feedback would be highly appreciated.\n\n\\------------------\n\n# Back Story\n\nAfter a long while, I have finally decided to upgrade my laptop, but the current market dynamics is too confusing for me right now esp. between currency hit, price differences, open-box deals, and Masked/refurbished options, it has been difficult to decide on a laptop that truly fits my needs. I would really appreciate some input from the community.\n\n# Current Setup\n\nI’m currently using an HP ProBook 450 G5 (8th Gen). It has served me well, but it’s beginning to show its age, especially under heavier workloads.\n\n# Requirements\n\nCore Specifications\n\nCondition: Brand new preferred  \nCPU: Intel i7 (H-series or equivalent or better)  \nRAM: 24 GB (16 GB minimum with expansion slot - no soldered ones)  \nStorage - (Must be SSD + HDD option)\n\n* SSD 512 GB for OS (second slot for future expansion is a plus)\n* HDD SATA 1 TB (2.5” inch)\n\nDisplay: At least IPS with decent color accuracy & brightness  \nGPU: Nvidia RTX Ada series or something slightly stronger for rendering, encoding/decoding performance. I can work with gaming series but no older than 4000 series.  \n  \nPorts and Connectivity\n\n* Multiple USB A/B/C 2.0/3.0 ports for accessories (mouse, external drives, cooling stand)\n* 3.5 mm audio jack\n* VGA/HDMI port for external display\n* RJ45 LAN port\n* Wi-Fi 4/5 GHz support\n\nKeyboard and Build\n\n* Full-size backlit keyboard (numpad preferred)\n* Rigid build with minimal flex or hinge wobble. Weight isnt an issue.\n* Easy to open for cleaning or upgrades\n* Local parts availability for future maintenance\n\n# Usage Pattern\n\n* My workload involves heavy office use with constant multitasking, often running numerous browser tabs alongside background tools for downloading and file-syncing. Current system starts to lag with ram & cpu reaching max capacity before apps start crashing.\n* I do not play games on the laptop as I have a ps5 pro for that - so I dont require top end latest GPU.\n\n# Not Considering\n\n* MacBooks, due to hardware/software compatibility issues with some custom tools I use.\n* Touchscreen, 2-in-1, tablets, flipbooks or hand-held devices\n* Desktops, as I often work from multiple client offices and need portability\n\n# Current Thoughts\n\n* I’ve been considering Lenovo ThinkPad T or P Series, but many models seem to use TFT panels by default. \n* HP Victus models have good specifications but poor reviews regarding build quality, screen wobble, and keyboard flex. \n* I’m also uncertain about Intel versus Ryzen options and would appreciate insights on that. \n* My goal is to move to at least an IPS panel, since my current laptop has a TFT. OLED would be ideal, but likely beyond budget.\n\n# Budget: \n\nAround 300,000 PKR\n\n# Important Points\n\n* Models that offer the best balance of performance, portability, display & build quality\n* I would prefer numpad on keyboard but if laptop model is worth it then I can compromise as a trade off.\n\nI know I might be asking for a lot, but any advice or recommendations would really help. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to share their thoughts.",

  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",

  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "First impression of the ASUS ZenBook S 14 258V (Lunar Lake) I received my S 14 about 24 hours ago and have been testing various features. While this isn't a comprehensive review, I hope it might be helpful to some.\n\n* **Processor:** Intel Core Ultra 7 258V 4 x 2.2 - 4.8 GHz, 37 W PL2 / Short Burst, 17 W PL1 / Sustained, Lunar Lake\n* **Graphics adapter**: Intel Arc Graphics 140V\n* **Memory**: 32 GB, LPDDR5x-8533, Dual-Channel\n* **Display**: 14 inches 16:10, 2880 x 1800 pixel 243 PPI, ATNA40CU09-0, OLED, glossy, HDR, 120 Hz\n* **Weight**: 1.179 kg\n\nThe build quality is impressive. The device looks sleek, super thin, and relatively light.\n\nThe display is excellent, though as someone who's seen and owned many OLEDs, I wish it were matte like the new Tab S10. Nonetheless, it's a really good screen. The touchscreen is a nice addition, but in my opinion, it would be better if the display could be laid flat. Everything runs smoothly at 120Hz, and it supports VRR.\n\nThe trackpad is one of the best mechanical ones I've used. While it doesn't compare to haptic trackpads, it's still very good.\n\nThe speakers are surprisingly good for a laptop this size. They caught me off guard with their quality.\n\nThe keyboard is decent, though I wish the keys had more travel. That's what happens when you've tried a ThinkPad keyboard – everything else falls short.\n\nI didn't buy it for gaming, but I tested Fortnite, and it played well. I also experimented with XeSS, which provided a good experience. But I'm not really a gamer, I play light games like Vampire Survivors, AoEIIHD, Mini Motorways, etc.\n\nOverall performance is okay, but not as snappy as Snapdragon-powered laptops. The multicore performance, in my opinion, is almost ridiculously low. Compared to an iPad M4, X Elite / X Plus, or M3 MacBook, it feels like it's lacking some power. This is hard to describe, and I'm used to high-end devices (my workstation has a 7950x, I have an M3 MBP from work, I've had a P14s with an 8840hs, etc), so maybe I'm just too demanding. However, my overall feeling is that it can easily become sluggish.\n\nIt's also quite loud, which is my biggest disappointment. I thought it'd be silent for web browsing and such. While typing this with only Obsidian and Edge open, the fan is spinning. The CPU temperature is around 45-50°C, drawing about 5W. I'm on \"Best Performance\" mode since the laptop is plugged in, but for less than 5W of CPU power, the fan activity seems excessive. Perhaps the chassis isn't great at dissipating heat. It's annoying, especially when any ARM device would be completely silent under these conditions.\n\nThe laptop wakes up almost instantly from sleep, but not quite as fast as ARM devices. Battery life seems better than typical Intel laptops, likely due to Intel's architecture optimization and fewer cores (and low performance). However, based on my brief testing, I don't think it'll match the battery life of X Elite / X Plus devices (SP11, Slim 7x, PZ13). The battery drained about 4% in 10.5 hours, which seems high compared to my PZ13, which only drained 1% in the same period.\n\nMy conclusion: If you need to use an x86-only app that doesn't emulate well, play games that don't run on ARM, want good battery life without needing much power, or don't believe in ARM's future in the PC world, this might work for you. The device is great. Lunar Lake is... a mixed experience. Otherwise, I'd recommend sticking with ARM. I think x86 in thin and light devices may be approaching its end.",
  "I thought battery life on lunar lake vs arm chips were relatively the same? And if not better than the snapdragon chips?",
  "One month update: \n\nThis is the best x86 portable device I've owned by far. It is mostly quiet when on Balanced or Power Saving. I was initially worried about the noise, but I guess \"Best performance mode\" was overkill anyway to browser the web, so my bad :) Again, not as snappy as ARM, but as good as it gets with x86 for a thin & light laptop. Battery life has been nothing short of amazing for my casual use. The overall package is really good on this device. Only con is that it's pretty expensive, but at least it comes with 32GB/1TB, not 16GB/512GB like the M4 MBP at the same price (but M4 should perform much MUCH better, and last much longer, but no OLED, no touchscreen, no upgradable storage, no WiFi7, etc).",
  "Want to buy a zenbook 15, doesnt asus have a setting that you can make the fan run slower ? doesnt that help with fan sound?",
  "Thanks for your review! I've been holding out as long as possible to replace my 2016 windows laptop. Wanted to see how lunar lake did in comparison to snapdragon. Kind of disappointed to hear that that its noticeably less powerful. I talked to a guy at microcenter who said they were getting a lot of returns on the ARM laptops because of the incompatibility.",
  "thanks for the review!   \namazed to understand it feels less snappy than the ARM variants.   \nalso i understand there is a serious performance drop while on battery?\n\ni think they should have put this weak cpu in extreme ultra portables like the surface or very thin and light devices. seems its not a buff enough for more than that?",
  "Hi OP, how about the wireless (wifi and BT) connections reliability ? \n\nI mean, i read that some user of ryzen ai based zenbook have issues with wireless connections reliability (probably because of mediatec chip ?).\n\nI'm still considering to get zenbook lunar lake or ryzen ai, still researching now",
  "So how is the screen outdoors ive heard people call it a black mirror is that true?",
  "could you let me know if this laptop charges above 65 watts? the charger it comes with is 65 but i’m curious if more works.",
  "Snapdragons are snappy until they aren’t compatible with native programs, then snapdragon becomes slow, clunky, and frozen. There are simply too many things still using non native arm for a snapdragon to truely replace a traditional laptop. At least for me. It makes me sad 😢",
  "When you talk about snappiness do you mean ARM is generally better than x86 or just better than 258v? Also which ARM CPUs are we talking in comparison to? Apple or Snapdragon chips?",
  "Thanks for the update. Thinking of getting one - does it get warm (at the bottom of the chassis) when on Balanced/Whisper mode? And how is the battery life comparing to the M3 MBP (I have the M1 MBP, hence the question)",
  "Yeah, that's right, there's a whisper mode. Right now I'm unplugged, the whole thing is draining \\~4w-5w, the CPU drains 1w-2w, CPU temp is 38. That's pretty good for sure, but it's also even more limited in performance in this mode. For $2500 CAD, that's a lot to ask for such limited performance.",
  "I'm also looking to upgrade (from a 2011 Gateway laptop), and as of right now it seems like Macbooks are the way to go if you don't care about Windows or gaming, Lunar Lake for thin and light general use (still waiting for more devices), and AMD for heavier use.\n\nThe reality is that Windows on ARM is just not 100% there yet. If it runs the software you need, it works great. But if it doesn't, it's basically useless. That's why you get OP singing praises about Snapdragon laptops and how x86 is dying, and the Microcenter guy saying people are returning them.\n\nAs an example, Snapdragon laptops can't even run Ableton Live in emulation mode, so it's a no-go for me. I really don't want to bother looking up the compatibility for all my software (and even if it runs in emulation, there's going to be a performance or battery penalty).",
  "No performance drop on battery AFAIK",
  "Zero issue with Wifi and BT",
  "It's glossy but it's as good or as bad as any other laptop IMO 🤷🏻",
  "65 max. The battery isn't that big tbh and 65 is more than enough for quick top-ups",
  ">When you talk about snappiness do you mean ARM is generally better than x86 or just better than 258v?\n\nThat X Plus / X Elite are snappier than X86. 258V is close, but ARM is still snappier. It adds up after hours of small really quick interactions.\n\n>Also which ARM CPUs are we talking in comparison to? Apple or Snapdragon chips?\n\nSpecifically, Snapdragon since we're talking PCs. But ARM in generally snappier since the instructions are less complex (thus require less time to execute).",
  "we're you able to get one with an English keyboard?",
  "💯\n\nWindows on ARM is great until your good patience is reached, eg: I can't print double sided on my brother printer, why? No drivers for ASIO, and I know focusrite will take forever to release their, if they ever do. It piles up really quickly, and these devices aren't cheap. So it's a matter of what you're willing to compromise the most... battery life? performances? compatibility? price?\n\nBattery life: ARM or Intel\nPerformances: AMD or ARM\nCompatibility: AMD or Intel\nPrice: previous gen AMD/Intel\n\nLunar Lake is a good balance, but it still lacks what ARM offers on battery life, perf per watt and features like instant wake up/no battery drain on sleep. But it runs everything, just a bit slower at time.\n\nIt's not easy 😅\n\nAnd then you have MacBooks that just do it all. 🙃 Okay except gaming but I personally don't care about it so",
  "I am also planning to replace my current laptop but currently holding it out as long as the current one works because I am confused whether to go with arm, lunar lake or macbook air. \n\nHopefully within next one year, it will be clear, but I am more and more leaning towards MBA",
  "Thanks...now i'm choosing between asus or lenovo",
  "I would really appreciate if you could send me afew pics showcasing the glare on the screen 🙏",
  "Any issues with outside use? Is it completely unusable or just worst?",
  "Thanks for the info. Looks like Lunar chips are good if you want to go with compatibility and somewhat improvement on power efficiency but not as optimized as snapdragon chips with that gives more snappy experience. AMD strix on the other hand consume more power and would probably need a big chassis to keep things cool.",
  "Yes only the labels are bilingual [https://i.imgur.com/vKb4n3B.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/vKb4n3B.jpeg)",
  "Purchased yoga x elite three weeks ago. I opted for snapdragon over macbook bc better repair-ability. I see a lot of people over-look this point when they compare windows vs apple. Screen replacement on windows costs \\~120USD and is possible to DIY. whereas screen replacement of a macbook air 15'' screen costs around \\~$600USD and can only be replaced by apple first party shop and takes days.",
  "Hello mate. Do you use this laptop for music production ? Runs smoothly ? Thx a lot",
  "I think it's a good idea to wait if possible because the M4 MBA should be coming early 2025, and more Lunar Lake laptops should be coming as well. But if you don't need Windows for specific software or games, then I would honestly just go MBA",
  "yes, even though I have been a windows user all through my life but plan to shift on mac because of the build quality and the long battery life it provides, I may take M2 MBA as now 16gb has become minimum and after the release of M4 MBA, the prices of M2 MBA will go down a bit hopefully.",
  "Need help choosing a laptop for grad school Ok, Reddit, I need help. TLDR: trying to decide between a single expensive computer with 2 screens, or one of 3 laptops with a color E-ink tablet. Links for all included.\n\nI know very little about computers, but I need a laptop for graduate school. It's online, so all of my textbooks are digital. I get wicked eye pain and migraines when using computers and my cellphone screens for too long, so I also need an E-ink tablet or display for reading. I'm currently using my sister's Microsoft Surface with 16gb RAM and 1TB SSD storage, and it works fast enough for me, so I've narrowed my choices down a bit based on that.\n\nI was going to get this one: \n https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkbook/thinkbook-plus/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-4-13-inch-intel/21jj0003us\n\nThis Lenovo ThinkBook Pro Generation 4 with both an OLED and E-ink screens (and I may still end up going that route), but there are a few detractors. 1) the price: even though it's originally almost $4k, $1,400+ is a lot to spend on a single device that only had 16 gb RAM, and that price doesn't include any extended warranty. 2) If it needs servicing, I'm out both my computer AND my textbook reader until it's fixed, and 3) I need a backlit keyboard. \n\n(My partner is gone 10-12 hours every weekday at work and goes to bed rather early, so we don't get a lot of time together. I have started working on papers and research in bed next to him at night and he just falls asleep while I'm working. He can sleep through pretty much ANYTHING - we joke that he had semi-voluntary narcolepsy! - but I don't want to have to keep the light on in order to do my work. So, backlit keyboard.)\n\nThe other choices I've narrowed down are as follows: \n\nhttps://a.co/d/iUbMkvb\nIt's HP, which I've had before and been somewhat unimpressed with (it wasn't a bad computer, it just didn't wow me), but being a major brand name, I figure if it needs servicing, it will be easier to get done. No backlit keyboard, though.\n\nhttps://a.co/d/ec0KPAQ\nThis is a brand I've never heard of, Rumtuk, but I found a couple reviews online that showed it worked well, even a year later. It's one of the only ones I found with a backlit keyboard in my preferred price range (less than $500 before the protection plan). I'm wary of getting an unknown brand, though (I would get the extended warranty, but if it breaks within the manufacturer's warranty, I'm screwed)\n\nhttps://a.co/d/eEHorDt\nThis is another Lenovo with twice the RAM for not much more price. I'm not a big fan of half the storage being on the cloud, and no backlit keyboard.\n\nAny of these 3 will be paired with a color E-ink tablet, which I'm also still trying to decide on. \n\nHelp me, laptop subreddit! You're my only hope! ",
  "Which affordable laptop to buy? Light gaming and editing? So after countless hours of googling i need some help and advice. i am by no means a computer whiz and honestly trying to fully understand specs is doing my head in.\n\nSo my McBook Air M1 finally died and I have been loving my baby. I do really like the apple design and layout and especially for editing and writing it’s been great.

  "Buying Help: ASUS Expertbook P5 226v vs ASUS Vivobook S 14 226v Hey everyone,  \nI'm in the market for a new laptop and I've narrowed it down to the Asus ExpertBook P5 (1068 EU) and the Asus VivoBook S14 (899 EU). Both with the 226v Core Ultra 5 processor. I'm going for Lunar Lake because of their efficiency and high battery life. I guess the difference in performance should be minimal since they have the same processor. The main use is office work. I'm on the road a lot so battery life is important. If I'm not on the road I plan to use it with a dock. I work in construction so build quality is also important.\n\nHere's what I found so far:\n\n# Battery Life 🔋\n\n* Asus ExpertBook: Various reviews show a mixed picture of the battery life, so I'm curious to hear about your experiences. It looks not as good as the Vivobook.\n* Asus VivoBook: Andrew Marc Davids review on YouTube Show really great battery life.\n\n# Build Quality 🛠️\n\n* Asus ExpertBook: Again mixed reviews online, specifically about the hinges\n* Asus VivoBook: Looks well built, not a lot of reviews\n\n# Screen Quality 💻\n\n* Asus ExpertBook: 14.00 inch IPS, matte 16:10, 2560 x 1600 144 Hz\n* Asus VivoBook: 14.00 inch OLED, glossy 16:10, 1920 x 1200 (WUXGA) 60 Hz\n\nThe Expertbook has a higher refresh rate and more ppi, but I think the OLED of the Vivobook will be just fine and will have nicer colours.\n\nI’m wondering what the ExpertBook offers for the extra price. However one big plus is the extra M.2 slot.\n\nThe laptop is for work.

  "The 2020 King of Portable 2 in 1s: LG Gram 2 in 1 14 inch **EDIT 4 5 MONTHS LATER:** [New Lenovo Carbon Yoga leaked on it's way, might be just enough to compete with the Spin 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lenovo/comments/hh0xzf/in_the_blink_of_an_eye_it_seems_the_almost/)\n\nEDIT 3: Found the mystery, it's the [Acer Spin 5 13.5](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Acer-Spin-3-and-Spin-5-are-now-slimmer-and-get-a-much-needed-upgrade-to-Intel-Ice-Lake.449311.0.html) inch which comes with 3:2 aspect ratio, not the LG Gram. It's not as a wide as the 14 Gram/c940, but it's about as equal in dimensions as the Surface Book 2 (taller than 16:9 14 inch laptops). For this reason + the almost exact same specs as the Gram, it would make it as a solid contender for the real king of 2020 2 in 1 portables.\n\nSmall note: Lenovo's c940 14 inch recieved a BIOS update which now gives about full 10 hour battery life(4K version, UHD probably gets a lot more), ALSO NOW coming close for that 2020 crown. At this point, it's all up to your tastes to which really deserves it.\n\nOriginal post:EDIT 2: So it seems that the aspect ratio of 3:2 in the Gram 2 in 1 was misinformation from a video, as it's apparently a 16:9 ratio instead. I'd still say this 2 in 1 is one of the best since it actually provides a bigger battery with a lot less weight than normal 14 inch models\n\nOriginal post:\n\nAfter a few companies have tried to make the perfect portable 2 in 1 convertible, LG actually went and finally pulled it off among it's competition with it's new Gram 2 in 1 14 inch announced at CES 2020.\n\nMain strong points:\n\nBigger and better battery life, which promises the highest battery life up to date for a 14 inch (not sure how much it was exactly, but I think it was about \\~70,000 mWh sized)\n\nOnly 2 in 1 to weight around 2.5 lb with that big of a battery and screen, making it's tablet mode really easy to use with maximum weight portability in mind\n\nGreat port selection up to HDMI and \\*Thunderbolt 3 (need confirmation there tho since previous Gram 2 in 1 did not have it, reviewer at CES said it might have it)\n\nAnd lastly, Intel's 10th gen chip with 11th gen Iris Plus Graphics for light gaming\n\nAs of now, only the Lenovo c940 could compete against this in the 14 inch category, but with relatively poor battery life and 0.5 pounds extra, the Gram seems to take the cake here. Honorable mentions I'd put the HP Spectre 13 inch late 2019 refresh (16:9 aspect ratio on a 13.3 inch screen tho, horrible design imo) and the new Samsung Galaxy Book Flex (which is like the XPS 13 2 in 1 but arguably better with some extra features with a 16:10 aspect ratio on 13.3 inch).\n\nMy only worries for the LG Gram 2 in 1 2020 so far: chassis hopefully is as sturdy as the c940 (or close to it since c940 has an excellent chassis durability), speaker system will probably not be as good obviously (c940 has Dolby Atmos 360 hinge, hopefully LG's sound will be not completely bad) and Thunderbolt 3's inclusion. Other than those worries, seems to be on it's way to being the 2020 king of portable 2 in 1's.\n\nNote: Did not consider any 2 in 1 15 inches and above since all have weights more than 4 lb and big form factor (while I would say the new HP Spectre x360 15 2020 is the best new coming relatively portable 15 inch 2 in 1, but weighing at 4 lb with a big chassis not many bags can fit, it would basically come at 2nd best portable 2 in 1 for 2020, in case you're looking in the 15 category. If gaming is your thing in the 2 in 1 category then this new HP will probably best fit your needs).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Small but important note: also worried the Gram might not have Windows Hello IR facial recognition, as that I believe is fundamental for any 2 in 1 to have while utilizing in tablet or tent mode. Hopefully it comes with IR additionally to it's finger print Windows Hello scanner to get the real title of (at least almost) perfect 2 in 1 ultraportable.",

  "2020 and you can't charge via USB-C. It's so usefull when you can charge laptop, for example in train via simple powerbank with PD.",
  "Valid point, but I'm lead to believe all 2 in 1's suffer from this. As an owner of a Lenovo Yoga c940 UHD 14' and past owner of a 2017 HP Spectre x360 13', can confirm both units had/have issues with thermals and sometimes fans spun up while even being at idle. Thankfully I discovered undervolting which quickly fixed that issue pretty fast, as fans (which were always an issue on c940's) barely turn on anymore with idle temps of 39-44 degrees. Before it would almost be at 54-60 on idle occasionally with Windows doing background processes, but undervolting did the trick just right.",
  "Oh well rip, I guess you're right. I saw a top CES laptops for 2020 video and it had mentioned a 3:2 for the 2 in 1. Can't find the original but now that I see your video up close yeah, that's definitely 16:9. I ain't mad tho since I decided to stick with my 14 inch c940 with 16:9 too so now I know I'm not missing much haha.\nThanks for clarifying!",

If you're interested in buying a 2 in 1, that one is definitely now in the competition thanks to that ratio. Edited main post comment.",
  "I'm pretty sure that you can? Just cuz a laptop comes with a proprietary power brick doesn't mean you can't use USB-C to charge it. I've seen even 15 inch which has proprietary and can still charge with USB-C.",
  "Depends on the laptop OFC. Most 2 in 1s pack really small single fan dual heatpipe coolers which are totally inadequate for anything hotter than a dual core and low end GPU. I think a few 15 inch 2 in 1s with dual fan coolers can be relatively cool under loads, but yea, most do get too hot",
  "[deleted]",
  "I have the 2019 version and charge via USB-C all the time so I'm sure you can do it.",
  "For the case of 15 inch, most of them do provide at least minimum adecuate cooling since they use actual dedicated GPUs for gaming/graphic design. Only reason why I excluded them from my analysis is due to body weight (4lb is honestly a bit too much for a 2 in 1) and screen size makes chassis far too big to carry around conventionally in backpacks for most people.",
  "Haha wow. Any reason specifically you didn't like all the ones you returned? What feature do you find them missing so much to not upgrade your c920?",
  "Hi u/teamblades44, what kind of USB-C charger do you use for something with such a big battery (I mean, can any USB-C charger charge as fast as the proprietary power brick?)",
  "Why do you think 4 pounds is too much? My 14 inch laptop is 4 pounds and I wouldn't say it's heavy",
  "You can use any 65 or 90 W USB-c charger.  I think it charges a tiny bit slower but even when I'm using it it still is charging it rather than discharging.",
  "I classify 4 pounds to be a bit on the heavy side for 2 main reasons (one mostly personal other a bit more objective)\n\n1. I carry my laptop in an over the shoulder backpack with a bit of cables and charging equipment. I used to always carry with me a 1.3 pound battery in that bag alongside my old Surface Pro 5, which gave it a bit of weight to the bag but manageable. With the 3 pounds from my c940 and 1.3 from the battery, I do feel shoulder pain when getting home most of the time, so I opted for carrying it my main backpack separately.\n2. My c940 14 inch at 3 pounds is juuust the borderline of what I would consider ideal weight for a 2 in 1. Using it in tablet mode is roughly hard due to weight + sharp edges which stab a bit into the hands, tho I do find 3 pounds to be good enough that the laptop can be held with one hand a bit relatively easy. But at 4 pounds, I wouldn't see myself ever using it in tablet mode and one hand usage would be on the bare minimum there. This is where the new Gram stands out with a killer 3:2 aspect ratio perfect for tablet mode plus an ideal 2.5 weight\n\nWhile I get this might be more personal since it's 1 pound difference from the c940, I know people like to carry light when on the go, and a 15 inch laptop for me is a bit too much for super portability too. Mostly this is just personal tastes, but a 3:2 aspect ratio with 14 inch wideness honestly would be more than good of a display for any needs I would say imo. It all comes down to personal tastes.",
  "If you use it in tablet mode, the weight doesn't matter...\n\nLike it could weight 10 pounds but that won't really affect how you use it as a tablet\n\nBut for day to day carry, I could totally understand wanting something lighter",
  "It actually does matter quite a bit haha, try holding the tablet in the air as you would an iPad to read and your arms will get tired pretty darn quick. Most reviewers always mention this for 2 in 1's since weight is what normally restricts tablet mode for most of them, except this here Gram which finally fixed the issue in a lot of senses.",
  "You don't hold it in your hands. You place it flat on a table like a tablet or drafting table",
  "As someone who suffers from constant neck pains from looking down too much while studying, holding the tablet in the air both in desk and in bed is a godsend feature for me. Really the only think I'll miss from my Surface Pro 5 tbh, since that only weighs a mere 1.7 pounds. I know other people in my school do this hence why I decided to mention it.",
  "Under $2000 AUD laptop recommendation Hi! I'm looking for a laptop that will hopefully last me 5-6 years and with a budget of $2000 AUD or less.\n\n**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**\n* $2000 AUD at the maximum, preferably $1800 AUD as a sweet spot.\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**\n* No, I'm looking for brand-new.\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**\n* Probably;\n   * Performance\n   * Battery life\n   * Form factor\n   * Build Quality\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**\n* Very important, I would prefer weight to be under 2kg. Thinness doesn't matter too much, so long as the laptop can fit the I/O I need.\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**\n* Maximum 14-inch, minimum would be 12-inch. Best would be a 13-inch 16:10/3:2 display.\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**\n* Yes, using apps;\n   * Premiere Pro / DaVinci Resolve\n   * Photoshop\n   * Minecraft\n   * PC Building Simulator\n   * and maybe Fusion360 (in the future)\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**\n* For all games, a constant 60fps or higher would be good. However I'm fine with down to 30fps.\n* Settings for Minecraft can include the default settings (plus OptiFine if possible)\n* Same applies for PC Building Simulator.\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**\n* Keyboard should be nice to type on, not like the current MacBook keyboards. Touch-screen would be nice, however not mandatory. Either Windows Hello Face or finger-print is needed. Build-quality should be good, for $1800 AUD shouldn't be full plastic construction (unless it's a ThinkPad which isn't even full plastic). Battery should last 8 hours (in real-world web browsing use, not the stupid manufacturer claims).\n* I/O should include at least 1x USB-A (at 3.0 speeds or greater), 1x USB-C (again at 3.0 speeds or greater) / 2x USB-C if one is used for charger, SD card reader, HDMI (version doesn't matter, but if it's a current gen laptop, HDMI 2.0 should be expected).\n   * Thunderbolt 3/4 is nice to have, however not needed. Same goes for Ethernet.\n* No external graphics unless it's actually better than an iGPU. Also gaming laptops are a no-go.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**\n* I want the laptop to be upgradable (SSD and RAM at the very least). I am aware that [frame.work](https://frame.work) would be the perfect choice, but as of now, they don't ship to Australia. They are the perfect candidate for most of my requirement though.\n* The laptop should also have a good IPS display (good meaning bright colours) but OLED displays are strictly forbidden.\n* If you can, could you please list reviews for laptops you recommend (from a reputable review source such as [Notebookcheck.com](https://Notebookcheck.com)). If you can't, that's fine as well.",

  "ASUS ImagineBook? Does anyone here have this laptop? \n\nI'm looking for something simple and cheap (under $500) to write on; I'd like a long battery life and comfortable keyboard, and it *has* to be a Windows laptop because I'll be using Scrivener for Windows. The most taxing thing I'd need it to do is potentially have multiple tabs open and sometimes watch movies/streams. It doesn't need to run games at all, I have a desktop for that. Portability would also be nice, as I will be taking it around with me.\n\nI came upon [this laptop called the ASUS Imaginebook](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-imaginebook-mj401ta-14-laptop-intel-core-m3-4gb-memory-128gb-solid-state-drive-textured-white/6375336.p?skuId=6375336). When I first saw it, it was $319. Given that it can be found at that price on Amazon and New Egg, I think they would price match--I would not pay $500 for this, but it seems good for my needs for the lower price. The [page on ASUS' website](https://www.asus.com/Laptops/ASUS-ImagineBook-MJ401TA/) makes it clear that this laptop is aimed at productivity, so it apparently has a very long battery life and nice keyboard. The thing is, aside from the Best Buy reviews, I can barely find anything online about this laptop. 4GB of ram seems low and it can't be replaced, plus since it's so cheap and a relatively unknown model, I would feel a lot more comfortable hearing people's long-term experiences with it before buying.\n\nI was also considering the Motile 14 whenever it goes back on sale, but the fact that it's an unknown brand makes me a little nervous since I don't have the money to just buy a new one if it bricks. Anyway, I just wanted to see if anyone out there could tell me a bit about this ImagineBook before I bit the bullet.",
  "I have now had the Asus Imaginebook for 24 hours and I. Am. AMAZED. This thing charged for less than an hour out of the box (around 11 am)  and stayed on until midnight and I was playing on it/setting it up all day. The biggest thing for me is the battery and how it NEVER gets hot!! I'm literally searching what type of battery it has while I stumbled upon this post. It charged all night and this thing is still not hot!! I don't get it! Also, it has NO FAN. Wtf!? It's completely silent. And it's beautiful- the body itself and the display. Super crisp and clear. I wish the speakers were louder but it has bluetooth so I can always connect it easily. I got an amazing sale price at Best Buy for $299. Hope this helps!!",
  "I got the motile 14 when it was on discount. IT'S PATHETIC.

  "Have you looked into the Acer Swift 1? I think for your purpose, it should be enough. It is lightweight, and Acer claims the battery could last up to 20 hours so irl I think it should last you about 10-12 hours. \n\nI currently have the Acer Swift 3 for some office work and internet browsing. So far, the battery lasted me 5-6 hours of usage (out of 10 hours that Acer claimed it to be). It comes with 4GB of RAM, which can be a bit limiting. I use firefox, with 6-7 tabs opened, it easily use up 80% of the RAM. But, there is another free slot for an extra RAM, so I can upgrade it whenever I want. \n\nHowever, I do not recall if the Acer Swift 1 has an extra free slot for RAM though, so you might be stuck with 4GB of RAM if you were to get the Swift 1.",
  "That thing has a Core M3 - stay away from it. That's a tablet-tier CPU; get something with at least an i3 8th gen or a Ryzen 3, that should be easy enough to find for less than 500 USD.

But my question about speed still stands lol.",
  "That's what I was afraid of. I've heard people say good things about them, but I'm suspicious of their build and quality control. I seem to be a magnet for problems like that, so I'm hesitant to go for Motile despite its specs at the price point.",
  "For people stuck on the fence, I bought both the Asus G14 & M15 so you don't have to and here is my Review/Comparison Hey guys, I am gonna like post this in like 2 or 3 spots in Reddit so don't hit me with spam flag.\n\n**The beginning is a my journey landing up to where I am, skip it if you just wanna read what I thought of the laptop.**\n\nNGL, I'm having a great time trying to buy a gaming laptop. My first laptop (Alienware M15 R2) was lost and damaged by FedEx... Customer Service gave me hell for trying to get a replacement/return.... Long story short, finally got it returned and did a hell of a lot of research to get my next laptop. After like a week of looking around and talking with a lot of people on Reddit, finally decided on the HP Omen 15 2020 refresh (That didn't work out cause Best Buy did ultimate screw up and gave me the 2019 version somehow, read my jank post on my profile). Now here I am with the Asus G14 and M15 cause I can't make up my mind by looking at the store display for 10 minutes.\n\nI got the G14 on August 4th cause it somehow came in 2 days after ordering. The M15 got delayed twice and ended up coming on the 9th. As soon as the M15 booted up, I could tell something was off about it. The screen looked so washed out compared to the store and had a weird yellow tint. Not a problem, called up Geek Squad and they told me it was defective and replaced it. A few days later, I got a notification that it arrived to my front door. Could not find anywhere for about 24 hours when I found it open and in the woods next to my house. Doesn't seem damaged or defective so I'm rolling with it.\n\n**Review**\n\nThis review is for the people who seem pretty split on what to get and also for the fun of it.\n\nThe specs for the M15 are Intel i7-10750H, 16GB Dual Channel 2933mhz RAM, RTX 2070 Max-Q, 240hz  3ms 1080p IPS 15.6\" Display, with a 1TB SSD.\n\nThe specs for the G14 are AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS, 16GB Dual Channel 3200mhz RAM, RTX 2060 Max-Q, 120hz 1080p 14\" Display, with a 1TB SSD. I believe I got a July batch Laptop. It seems to have fixed a lot of issues that the r/ZephyrusG14 complains about.\n\nI did not screw with the out of the box settings like undervolting or overclocking (sorry to those who wanted to hear that). I did not repaste the either computers.\n\nFor tests, I ran 3DMark Fire Strike, Time Spy, Death Stranding with DLSS 2.0 turned on, Risk of Rain 2 on Max settings, and Rainbow 6: Siege on Ultra... I ran the 3DMark tests 3 times with different fan settings to see if there was a significant change. Once on Silent setting, once on Performance setting, and once on Turbo setting...\n\nNormal Tasks = Zoom/Discord/Google Meet, Spotify, 10 Chrome Tabs, and IDE compiler running in the background.\n\nI had the G14 a lot longer but I basically used the M15 from 12pm on the 14th till 12am on the 16th. I love how fast both go, both feel strong and durable. It might just be me considering I came from a desktop with Ryzen 5 2600, 16GB RAM, and RX 480... That and I've been in laptop buying hell for the last month and everything feels great...\n\n**CPU**\n\nG14: Ryzen 9 is really strong and super worthwhile. I thought it was all hype and reviewers blowing it out of proportion. I see now that I am wrong. Compiling and gaming never happened so quick before. It's also very low-powered compared to other computers so that was also interesting to see. For the Physics score in Fire Strike, it got a average of 21852. For the CPU score in Time Spy, it got a average of 7508. Runs actually really cool. While doing normal tasks, it hovers around 32-40C. While playing Siege, its low 70s. While in Death Stranding, its mid 70s. While in Risk of Rain 2, it mid 60s.\n\nM15: Hey, it's your super standard Intel. It runs well like it usually does. No complaints there. Probably want to undervolt it through the BIOS cause it will run hot no matter what at least from experience. There's been a massive heatwave since I got the laptop so I don't have the most accurate data on the temperatures but I'll give what I have. For the Physics score in Fire Strike, it got a average of 11512. For the CPU score in Time Spy, it got a average of 4903. Runs a lot hotter than I care to have. It might be cause for the heatwave but it shouldn't have any significant effect. While doing normal tasks, it hovers around 47-53C. While playing Siege, its mid to high 70s. While in Death Stranding, its mid 70s. While in Risk of Rain 2, it mid to high 60s.\n\n**GPU**\n\nG14: Honestly wish it came with a normal 2060 cause it might fit but hey, Max-Q wasn't too far behind in frames or performance.  Sure it's only 65w but it works extremely well. I'm not sure what ROG boost is but it seems to give better performance than the usual 2060 Max-Q. For the Graphics score in Fire Strike, it got a average of 15572. For the GPU score in Time Spy, it got a average of 5783. Runs actually really cool in general. Much cooler than the HP Omen while playing games and doing normal tasks. While doing normal tasks, it shuts down and basically is in power saving mode. While playing Siege, its mid to low 70s. While in Death Stranding, its mid to high 70s. While in Risk of Rain 2, it low 60s.\n\nM15: Stronger GPU than the 2060 Max-Q. Sure it is the Max-Q variant but it's still good. It is the 90w but again, stronger than the G14. It runs hotter than the G14 but cooler than the Omen. It also does that power saving thing which super useful to save battery.  For the Graphics score in Fire Strike, it got a average of 20231. For the GPU score in Time Spy, it got a average of 7581. Runs actually really cool in general. Much cooler than the HP Omen while playing games and doing normal tasks. It is significantly hotter than the G14 so it might be an issue for some. While doing normal tasks, it shuts down and basically is in power saving mode. While playing Siege, its mid to high 70s. While in Death Stranding, its high 70s. While in Risk of Rain 2, it mid 60s.\n\n**Keyboard & Mouse**\n\nG14: Keyboard is a great typer. Wrote an essay for class on it and it felt great. Keys are in a good spot and it feels like it can handle well. There isn't any key ghosting while playing games and whatever heat that comes through the keyboard is rather manageable. My only strong dislike is the backlight of the keys. Consistent lighting isn't the issue, its more that it ain't bright. I like to work during the night so it ain't a issue in the dark but it really sucks in the day and in well lit rooms. I really want to swap the keys out for the gray keys.\n\nM15: Also a great typer. It feels very similar to the G14. I could type this whole post on the M15 and it doesn't feel weird. Backlight is so much better on this and the power to change between RGB colors gives the gamer feel back. Heat is a bit an issue because the heat seems to escape through the keys. More on the top rows rather than smack in the middle.\n\n**Screen**\n\nG14: I don't why people are complain about the response time. It feels great, I could play fast paced games like Siege with ease and no issues. Much brighter than the M15 and great for working in the dark. I appreciate the Eyecare feature more than I care to admit. 120Hz is very good for gaming. I have a 144Hz 3ms monitor and it felt rather comparable to that. Color range was good and it felt on par with my old MacBook Pro but I ain't any creator. I could multitask pretty well on this laptop.\n\nM15: First one was defective so I ain't commenting on that. I do have to admit that it's a bit dimmer than the G14 but it's still very good quality. Color range is rather nice but again I ain't a creator/editor of an kind so I won't comment on that either. 240Hz is overkill because most new games won't hit that high unless you take a notch down on quality. 3ms guaranteed response rate is nice to have in my opinion and less things to worry about. The bigger screen lets you have a larger workspace which is nice for programming.\n\n**Overall Gaming**\n\nG14: Powerful CPU paired with weak GPU is sad to see but it is very powerful as it is. I'm getting an average of 136 FPS in Ultra Graphics Siege if it's uncapped but I cap it at 120 FPS. Death Stranding seems to average around 99-105 FPS with DLSS 2.0 on. It's not as bad as I thought it would be in complete honesty. Risk of Rain 2 is rather low end in terms of specs required so it hits Ultra rather easily at max frames. Combined score for Fire Strike is 14444. Combined Score for Time Spy is 5988.\n\nM15: Very balanced pairing. I'm getting an average of 158 FPS in Ultra Graphics Siege but it's nowhere near the max of 240. I'm getting around 133-140 FPS on average for Death Stranding with DLSS 2.0. It's pretty good but I was hoping for more performance. I wasn't paying attention for Risk of Rain 2, it was smooth and nice to play. Combined score for Fire Strike is 14883. Combined Score for Time Spy is 7098.\n\n**Thermals**\n\nG14: It's rather cool under stress for what it's worth. I do feel it's weird they blow hot air up into the screen but ain't an issue for me. Stays extremely cool while doing normal tasks and absolutely nothing. Thermals seem to be spread out well and not concentrated in one area.\n\nM15: Much hotter in general whether it's under stress or just doing normal stuff. Might be cause of the heatwave so I'll recheck again after it finally cools down. Keys do get a bit hot to the touch if using the function keys or number row but nothing where it hurts. The liquid metal seems to be gimmick to be completely honest but it seems to be a lot cooler than the Omen with very similar specs so I'll shut up about that.\n\n**Build Quality & Portability**\n\nG14: Magnesium Alloy with Aluminum mixed in. Definitely is durable and has that strong build like an Apple Product. It is also very light weight and portable.\n\nM15: Plastic but it feels pretty premium. It feels durable and should last the 4 years I'm looking for. A bit heavier than the G14 but much lighter than the Omen. Very portable for the specs it has.\n\n**Software and Overall System**\n\nSoftware is basically the same. Only difference is whether you deal with AMD or Intel for Graphics Drivers and what sound drivers you are dealing with.\n\n**Speakers**\n\nG14: You got Dolby Audio which is a banger in my opinion. It has a dynamic setting which changes the audio presets on the fly. It's really strong and extremely audible at low volumes. Bass can be felt if you put the laptop on your lap. Surround sound is precise.\n\nM15: You got Realtek Audio mixed with Sonic Studio. Not bad but nothing amazing either. The sound really has to be raised if you are planning to game with just speakers. It doesn't really have strong bass or sound in general from whatever I tinkered with. It does get strong if you personally make it strong in the Sonic Studio equalizer. Surround Sound could be improved in my opinion.\n\n**Battery**\n\nG14: It's seems you can get 10 hours on this laptop by turning off all the aggressive CPU features, forcing the GPU to sleep, and messing with some settings in the drivers. I got a solid 8ish hours from 100% and 6ish hours on 80% doing my normal stuff noted above. Charger is large but not large enough where it's a pain to carry around. I could extend the battery by plugging in my USB-C phone charger (OnePlus 30w charger) into a wall/battery bank (Anker) and it managed to keep the percentage the same or slow it down significantly depending on what I was doing.\n\nM15: I have no idea what the actual estimated life is but it definitely is smaller than the G14. I did the same mess around in settings that I did for the G14. I got a bit varied life from just over 4 hours to nearly 5 hours doing my normal things. Charger is so much larger than the G14 and also much heavier. I tried the USB-C charging on here and was a bit disappointed. It did extend the life a bit but not as significantly as the G14. It wasn't bad at all and is still very viable to charge via USB-C if in a pinch, it's just not as strong as it was made to be.\n\n**Storage**\n\nI think its the same Intel 660p SSD. No problems there, fast SSD for both gaming and everything else you want to do. I've seen a video that makes it looks somewhat easy to upgrade but I haven't tried myself so don't quote me on it. Honestly, 1TB should fit more than enough stuff....\n\n**Camera & Microphone**\n\nHah, Asus forgot to put in a Camera in a whole lineup of laptops. Living off of iVCam until I can hunt down a cheap clip on webcam (like that will happen anytime soon). Microphone is very strong compared to others I've used. I find the G14 Mic placement to be better than the M15 only because the M15 Mic is at the bottom of the screen rather than on top. It catches more fan noise when gaming but other than that, both are equal and great.\n\n**Random stuff like IDEs and other junk**\n\nMy fellow programmers, I am a noob compared to many people on Reddit but I am majoring in it so it's important in my decision. I know a lot of people were worried about the Intel only extensions such as AVX2 but it seems to work fine the G14 as well. I haven't tried anything super hard or special but it seems to work fine by whatever samples/tests I was given by another user on Reddit.\n\nI really do like the fingerprint reader on the G14, it speeds up my life instead of typing my 10 digit PIN.\n\nM15 comes encrypted with bitlocker out of the box which is a nice touch and saves me time of doing it myself. G14 ain't encrypted out of the box but easy to do if needed.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nTake the M15 if you want a stronger gaming laptop. The battery and thermals take a hit but you get a better screen, more ports, and larger screen. Surprisingly portable given the size and what's in the computer.\n\nTake the G14 if you want a productivity laptop that can game hard. The battery and thermals are amazing no matter what you do. Also very portable and looks like a MacBook Pro if you trade the keyboard keys out for the gray variant. You take a hit in terms of ports and smaller screen but it isn't super noticeable if you aren't looking.\n\nI think I am gonna go with the G14 cause it hits my portable powerhouse that is like a MacBook Pro aspect and I got about $200 off on it but I still have a few more days before I decide completely.\n\nI'm super down to hear what you think.  Let me know if you got any suggestions or need any clarification.",
  "Is the m15 r2 really all plastic? I thought it was made of magnesium alloy (at least per Dell's website)?",
  "Ah, no this is the Asus M15, not Alienware. Apparently I might be wrong on that either way cause M15 from Asus is partially Magnesium.",
  "Which of these computers is a better deal? I’ve been looking for a laptop that’s sturdy, will last, and can handle some pretty light gaming (The Sims 4 on medium settings). I think I’ve found two that certainly meet my needs and my price point. Both have dedicated graphics cards and are under $800. \n\n[The Lenovo Thinkbook 14S](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0831P63GN/ref=psdcmw_13896615011_t1_B0831NZY5V) is the one I like a little more because it’s supposedly a “business” spec laptop, so I expect a little more longevity than the Asus. Although it costs a little more, it has more RAM and a bigger SSD, which is a huge plus - and I believe the RAM is upgradeable. However, my bullshit sensors are kinda going off because I can’t find another Thinkbook 14S with these same specs - all the other 14S with 512 GB SSDs and 16 GB Ram have i7 processors, not i5 ones. Is this laptop legit? If not, I’m still looking at the Thinkbook 14S with 8 GB ram and 256 SSD as a potential laptop.\n\n\n[The Asus Zenbook](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-zenbook-14-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-mx350-256gb-ssd-light-gray/6403819.p?skuId=6403819) is also really nice for the price and I feel confident in Asus’ reputation. However, I’m having trouble finding reviews for this specific zenbook because it seems that there are 410372 different versions - from a review I read that might’ve been about this same laptop said that cooling issues may be a cause for concern. I do worry that since the Zenbook isn’t really a business-ish laptop that I’ll have more issues with it, but oh well.",
  "The Asus is the obvious choice here. Even if the memory can't be upgraded (which it very well might be able to) the 4500U and MX350 stomp all over the ThinkBook. If there is a similar model to the Asus with the same cpu/gpu but with more ram/storage for ~$900, I would take that over the $750-800 ThinkBook.",

  "The 4500U still handily beats out the 10th gen i5, and I doubt the Radeon 610 GPU is at all worth it over the Vega 5. And given the fact that it still has 8gb/256gb I don't think it's worth.",
  "Have an ancient gaming PC, need laptop for work. Anyone ever \"upgrade\" your PC to a laptop without regret? Need a laptop for work that can handle some decent horsepower. This puts me into the $1300-1500ish range out of the gate.\n\nCurrent I work on my desktop *which does the job* but it's running on hardware I've slowly upgraded since 2006, with the newest part being a 970 running on a 2500k processor. As fun as my cost effective upgrade era was, I'm definitely at the point in my life where I'm looking for a new build because I'm woefully behind on current hardware standards, and would rather not have to deal with lots of upgrading.\n\nI don't game that much anymore, but occasionally would like to be able to play something current, especially if I manage to get back into gaming in a more serious way.\n\nThis got me thinking I should focus my upgrade path twords a gaming laptop. I need a laptop anyways that has decent power, and I'm willing to pay for high quality. Especially with how good it seems these laptops have gotten last year. The Razer blade in particular appeals with it's mix of professional looking, small footprint, and quality build (if you don't get a dud). Plus all the new rtx laptops that just came out - though I'm waiting for reviews on them before getting too invested in that idea. Just seems right now gaming laptops are finally hitting this sweet spot in performance, portability, quality.\n\nBut I don't want to regret my purchase. I worry about longevity mostly (I can under clock to help prevent this though right?). My partner uses Mac book that has lasted 6-8 years and I'd like to try and have this purchase do the same. I actually eyed MacBooks for this upgrade for their longevity, build quality, and general high performance outside games until I realized my program i use for work doesn't support Mac.\n\nWhat do you all think? I'd love to hear from folks who did a \"new build\" upgrade from a PC to a laptop, and if they regretted it or loved it. I just figure it would be more cost effective, sanity effective, and flexible to go this route instead of having to get a cheaper but still expensive laptop AND a new build (that I would only use for games, which I play infrequently).",
  "I used to sell computers for 10 years and always has a desktop. Once I got a decent laptop, I never looked back. It’s nice to be able to use it anywhere. ",
  "I tried that, but gaming laptops are loud. Maybe the rtx series will be better since more power efficient. Ended up buying water colled 1080 for my old desktop a year later.\n\nYou probably can get a decent work laptop (you dont need much power really) and a gaming desktop for a similar price than premium gaming laptop. And desktop are more powerful.",
  "I tried to use a gaming laptop for a while but ended up upgrading my old desktop with a 970 and I'm still using it. It has a 4th generation i7 and I'm fully satisfied with it's performance. And I changed my gaming laptop for a light one, 14\" with a mx150. For me this is the best set up, the mx150 give me enough juice to play some games on the go, but a like to play more at home anyway. I believe the 970 will be enough for one more year maybe two. I didn't like using a game laptop, it gets too hot, it's not comfortable to play with, it's expensive, generally not portable, too much noise. ",
  "Didnt regret because company paid for the laptop xD.",
  "Yeah, am still considering that but just like the idea of consolidating my hardware. And it'll still be just as expensive (if not more) with a new desktop and a work laptop.\n\nMy work involves architectural drafting/renderings, potentially interactive as the business grows. Witch the occasional distant dream of doing hobby game dev on it in my future (nothing crazy), so I'll need the memory/CPU to be pretty solid and will benefit greatly from at least a half decent GPU. This already puts me in a stone's throw away price wise from full gaming laptops.",
  "Check dave2d channel then. There's a new msi laptop thin with a 1050ti that could fit.",
  "Dell XPS, HP Spectre x360, or Razer options, ultraportables vs 15 inch models, trying to decide Sorry for the pseudo double-post since I also posted on Suggest-a-Laptop, but in this case I have three laptops that I've researched fairly extensively and want opinions regarding them specifically more so than a person sending me a link of laptops meeting my \"form\" specification.\n\n\\* \\*\\*Total budget and country of purchase:\\*\\*\n\nUSA. Ideally sub-$2k budget, but I could be convinced to spend more for a machine that will last longer, or combined with an eGPU or separate desktop later on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\\*\\*\n\nI don't care about 2 in 1, but my most recent computers have been a Surface Pro and then the late 2016 Razer Blade Stealth with touch. I absolutely cannot get another laptop/hybrid without a touch screen. I use it more than the trackpad. Before that, I used a Thinkpad joystick/nipple, so I've never felt comfortable with trackpads. I currently use my RBS with a mouse/monitor setup, or on my lap with a mix of trackpad and touch screen. Mostly touch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\\*\\*\n\nPrior to the Surface Pro, I had an IBM and then a Lenovo Thinkpad. They started to feel too clunky when I started carrying my computer with me everywhere. I do value something slimmer, something in the ultrabook or lighter weight 15\". (E.G. XPS15, Razer Blade, but not a 17\", and not a fat ugly gaming rig).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\\*\\*\n\nWindows\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\\*\\*\n\n13-15\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\\*\\*\n\nMostly general use, but also would like to be able to play some games, some AI use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\\*\\*\n\nWould be nice to hit at least 60fps for recent games at low-medium settings. Not required for the ultrabook, say, if I got another thin-and-light computer with Thunderbolt connectivity for an eGPU.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\\*\\*\n\n\\-Portability: Ideally portable. Razer Blade 15 is about as heavy as I'm interested in.\n\n\\-Touch: Absolutely need touch-screen. As stated above.\n\n\\-Build quality: I've had some problems with recent computers, so I'm not sold on the idea that one company or another is or isn't great. My IBM Thinkpad after about 5 years of life had issues with overheating despite new thermal paste application (but probably lasted the longest). The Lenovo was never reliable. I switched to the Surface Pro... which was pretty great except for the charging adapter being absolutely terrible and not registering (which I noted with other users as well), and after getting a replacement that worked for some time... it also stopped working very well, and by then I'd run out of memory and wanted something with more I/O... so the Razer Blade Stealth had the expected issue of not registering the battery appropriately, and on day one I had to download a BIOS update (known issue I had seen in one of the reviews when I purchased the computer). I needed to send it in for an RMA due to constant freeze/buzzing issues (they told me they eventually replaced the motherboard). Recently it's been acting up making a loud crackling/buzzing noise (no freezing, not coil whine) that's probably related to the fan, but can go weeks at a time without issue... that's made me reticent to bring my poor computer out in public... Basically I've had a bad experience with Razer, but then again, I've not had the best experience with Microsoft or Lenovo either. Hopefully just bad luck, and the next computer will be a bit luckier...\n\n\\-Ports: I need Thunderbolt since I want the option for an eGPU or a Thunderbolt dock. In the past I've tried a regular USB dock with past computers, and there was too much lag to make it useful. I also want more ports than what Microsoft is offering with any of their new offerings. If they had come up with a Surface Book 3 with updated hardware, I would have been interested. At minimum, I don't want to lose ports (currently USB-C + 2x USB-A and HDMI). XPS 2 in 1 feels ridiculous. One charging USB-C, and one to plug things into. XPS 13 laptop is essentially a step backwards with one USB-C used for charging, one to replace HDMI, would then leave me with one fewer USB port available. Probably fine to get a dock, giving me two USB ports. Spectre 13 similarly loses me a USB port if I didn't have a dock. The new RBS keeps ports, but has other drawbacks. The alternative is getting a 15\" model but losing portability in favor of power and ports.\n\n\\-Memory: I need at least 512GB, preferably NVMe SSD. Would like 16GB+ for RAM, especially for the 13\" models as RAM is usually not upgradeable.\n\n\\-Display: My perfect laptop doesn't exist. If I get a 13\", I don't need to sacrifice battery for 4k since I can't tell the difference anyway, but the only touch options at this size seem to be 4k displays. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\\*\\*\n\nI THINK I've narrowed my list down to two categories, and three options within each (Razer, HP Spectre x360, or Dell XPS):\n\n1. Ultra-portable with plan for a secondary Thunderbolt dock or eGPU\n2. 15\" that still maintains some portability.\n\nUltra-portable:\n\n1. Razer Blade Stealth late 2019:\n   1. Don't lose any ports, maintain a light form factor with improvement in bezels, and actually increased power that would still allow \"light\" gaming.\n   2. The GTX1650 is fine... but comes at the cost of 15w for the CPU, basically throttling the CPU in favor of having a decent GPU. I'm not sure the extra price is worth what really isn't a gaming machine. (Comes in at $1900)\n   3. Honestly would be happy to get an Iris Plus Graphics model, would LOVE Mercury White... but those options are either NOT touch-screen or not 512GB for the SSD. Cheapest touch option (if I am understanding the Razer site) is an MX150 with 8th gen CPU and 4k panel for $1700, and it just doesn't seem to make sense to pay so much for an \"older\" model with a weaker GPU, though true it is an actual dedicated GPU.\n   4. Doesn't have microSD (though I haven't felt like I \"needed\" it as long as I have enough local memory and cloud options).\n2. Dell XPS 13 or XPS 13 2-in-1\n   1. Minimal ports. Boo. But could dock it.\n   2. XPS 13 has the \"other\" Intel 10th gen CPU, so maybe not as optimized for minor graphics/AI? However, it is 6-core, so maybe more powerful. The 2-in-1 uses Iris Plus but is even MORE limited in ports. I am fine with a touch laptop, but if equally viable, I'd go for one that can do full double duty as a hybrid. Again, supposing I use a dock, the port issue is fine? This all assumes that Thunderbolt docks work reasonably well without the lag I've experienced with \"regular\" USB docks.\n   3. XPS 2-in-1 seems to have a non-4k option, which might save some battery life and price.\n   4. Quality control issues?\n3. HP Spectre x360 13, late 2019\n   1. This is what I'm leaning toward. Also lose a port (like the XPS 13), but better than the XPS 2-in-1 and in a similar form factor, with a sleek almost bezel-less design. Would have to dock. Coming in at $1500, so pretty much the cheapest option (or about tied with the XPS13).\n   2. Comes with a pen! lol\n   3. I am having trouble determining if the CPU has 15w or 25w (Iris Plus version of 10th gen). Also not sure if the SSD is NVMe?\n   4. Like the others, only 4k options, though people seem to like the screen, and if the non-touch can reach 22hours (company testing conditions), then the OLED should probably still have reasonable battery life.\n   5. Quality control issues?\n\n15\"\n\n1. Razer Blade 15\n   1. As much as I want one of these, I can't really justify paying $3100 for the cheapest touch option. Unless there's some non-4k, or non-GTX2080 configuration I can get, anything reasonably priced is non-touch. I don't need a fantastic video card, but in the 15\" model, I do want a usable GPU. The reasonably priced ($1700-1800 options) have GTX1060Ti or 2060, but sadly no touch screen. Even with older models.\n   2. Anyone see a perfect Blade out there?\n2. HP Spectre x360 15\n   1. As much as I like the 13 inch model, I haven't really seen any reviews online for the new 15 inch model.\n   2. This is the only 2-in-1 15\" option I'm currently looking at.\n   3. $1700 (or possibly $1530 with discounts), this is the cheapest 15\" model I see among those I'm looking at most closely. However, the GPU seems to be sacrificed, with MX250 as the option.\n3. Dell XPS 15\n   1. This is probably the one I would lean toward. For $2k I could get 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD, lots of ports, GTX1650, touch, on a 6-core 9th gen CPU.\n\nSo basically looking at any experiences people have had with any of the above options. Would love to hear how the new Spectre is working out, if you found a better Razer configuration, if you've had QC issues with Dell or HP or Razer, what you might lean toward. I'm also open to other ideas (I haven't looked too deeply at the Lenovo Yoga models, for instance). I love the Surface lineup in general, but I feel like I'm probably getting more for my money with these options... though it would be nice to have an actual brick-and-mortar option for when any problems arise. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this!",

  "Surface Book 2 vs HP Zbook X360 Studio  \n\nSo I'll be editing Video/photo/audio. a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I need the portability plus 2in1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt came down to those 2.\n\n**Surface Book 2 vs HP Zbook X360 Studio**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know that overall the Zbook would be more powerful (specially now it has I9, goes to 32 and eve 64gb) but having almost no reviews online, being HP, and being way more expensive makes me skepctical and leaning foward the Surface Book 2 which is already expensive.\n\nI wonder if the Surface Book is already dated or it would be powerful enough for me... It bugs me a little the fact that is just 16gb.\n\nBUT I think  GTX 1060 from SB2 outperforms the NVidia Quadro P1000 from HPZBook right?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I'm willing to change my mind (or if there's another one in between)",
  "I'd go with the Zbook, unless you need the detachable panel of the Surface. ZBook is workstation class: powerful CPUs, extensible RAM and storage, built like a tank, easily repairable. That's why it is expensive. You can find a good look at it from these youtube videos: \n\n- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqj56blPTlWONMuWpFBH2aQ/videos  (3 videos, make sure to read all comments)\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FLQR3B5iaA\n\n\nI've been debating getting the Zbook X360 Studio (that 600 nit touch display must be something!), thus researching it quite a but in the end I do not need a touchscreen and prefer a 17\" screen thus I have opted for Thinkpad P72.\n",
  "So I returned a Surface Book 2 to buy the Zbook x360 a few months back. I'm mostly happy with that decision, but here's a few key differences. The Surface Book definitely won in battery life, keyboard, weight, and the ability to detach the slate. The Zbook is just a beast otherwise. I opted for the 600 nit Dreamcolor display which I find amazing. I opted for the Core i7 model and 32 GB of RAM which fits my needs well. It also just feels well built and solid. The 5 lb. weight sounds worse than it really is. The keyboard is not of the Thinkpad or Surface range, but respectable. The battery life is the best you can expect for a 6 core i7 at 6-7 hours, so don't expect to be away from a charger. I bought it and a Surface Go for about the same price as the SB2, and other than wishing I had opted for a low end Surface Pro I'm pretty happy with how things turned out. If you're willing to take a risk on quality, HP also just released a new Spectre X360 with similar specs to the Zbook. I'm not sure if that model supports 32 GB of RAM. The Surface Book is also overdue for a refresh so they may have some surprises there.",
  "&#x200B;\n\nYeah  those were the only reviews i have found so far. But one is just an unboxing with no follow up... The other is more like a review, but the guy reported some issues on the third video. Even though it makes me think\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it's risky to buy based on one review only... Not even on amazon they have any reviews. I mean it's clearly the most potent one, but if none of the competitors were able to do it I always think there must be a reason, and the fact that we don't see anyone reporting how good the zbook is makes me wonder...",
  "I think HP has a policy where you can return it within 2 weeks, so there's that. Zbook is HP flagship mobile workstation laptop brand. They are fine.\nThe x360 is still very new and is immediately outsold when the premade config is available on the HP site for my country.\nBTW, the x360 is not in the same category than the Surface Book 2: it's not detachable, sturdier, slightly heavier but more poweful and extensible and can be equipped with Xeon and Quadro, you can get x years of on-site guarantee...\nSpeaking of reviews, you can probably find at least someone on the Internet that had a problem with any laptop model.",
  "Hmm I wonder how would that work if I live in Brazil? Would the guarantee work overseas? Or I mean, we have HPs here but not that model I guess",
  "Gigabyte Aero 15x The Gigabyte Aero 15x is an overall great laptop. \n\nPrior to purchasing this laptop, I did some research and through some friend's recommendation I decided to purchase the Gigabyte Aero 15x. I was still skeptical on how great this laptop can be for and I just paid a hefty sum for it. Upon opening the box and actually holding the laptop, I was surprise on how light it was. It is still 4.5lbs, but for all the hardware that is inside the laptop, Its considerably right. I also do like how it feels as I touch it with my hand. The hinge on the laptop is quite nice and sturdy. The only design complaint i have is that the webcam is positioned in a very awkward area, but it does give the monitor the great bezeless feel\n\nThe laptop has an amazing monitor. The 15 inch 1080p 144hz monitor looks fantastic. I was amazed on how crisp and sharp the image was. I never thought this was possible on a laptop, but here I am using it. It booted up very fast and the you can load programs pretty fast. It was also great that it didnt come with too many bloatware, so I didnt have to waste time uninstalling.\n\nAfter setting up and booting the laptop, I do recommend updating all the drivers. It will help the laptop run smoother. \n\nAfter using the laptop for a bit and playing Players Unknown Battleground, there are some pros and cons I would like to point out. \n\nPros: The display is amazing, its even better than the monitor I currently use with my PC setup (AOC G2460PQU). It can run PUBG on high settings at 60+ FPS. Even when the fan is running, its not extremely quiet, but its a lot quieter than you would expect it to be since its running at GTX 1070. This laptop also runs lightning fast. I am amazed at how fast it can boot up and load programs. The battery life is also amazing. You would expect a poor battery life since its running a GTX 1070, but I can keep it unplugged for hours before having to charge it. Having a long battery life is a big plus for me, as I am always on the move and needing it to run Photoshop and Autocad. Gigabyte was also considerate enough to allow us to expand our memory and ram. Instead of providing 2x 8GB ram sticks, they only used 1x 16GB ram stick, and there are 2 slots which I will be taking advantage of in the future. They also provided an M.2 SSD 512GB, and also gave us a free M.2 SSD slot, so if you need more memory, there is no need for an external harddrive.\n\nCons: The trackpad is the bane of this laptop. Prior to purchasing this laptop, I was using the macbook air, and the Aero 15x trackpad is no where comparable. I had to install the lenovo trackpad driver for this laptop to make it more bearable. This makes the trackpad more macbook like, but still inferior and it takes sometime getting used to. The keyboard feels nice, and I am a sucker for RGB, but its too compact. I am still adapting to the keyboard and learning how to type much more efficiently with it. I am always misclicking and whatnot. I know its an expensive laptop, and it feels like they want to give you the option of having everything a desktop would have, but I think the number pad is excessive. On my desktop, I barely use the number pad, so i would prefer to rid of the number pad and expand the keyboard so it does not feel so cramped. \n\nDespite having 2 big flaws in my book, I am overall happy with the this laptop. It does everything I need it to do and more. All the pros outweigh the cons in my book. Would I recommend this laptop to anyone? Of course. As of right now, I dont think are any true competition for this laptop. There are other Max-Q Series by Asus, Aorus, Razer, and MSI. Aesthically, I think the others have better designs, but the Gigabyte Aero 15x won me over with its long battery life.\n\nRecommend: 9.5/10.0\nDesign: 8.5/10.0\nSpeed: 10.0/10.0\nOverall: 9.5/10.0\n\n",
  "I hate to shit on your review, but what exactly are you providing here? It just seems like you're rehashing the same things you find in every review, providing little numbers / stats as opposed to \"It can run PUBG on high settings at 60+ FPS\". You completely ignore the fact that 1x16GB means you aren't getting dual channel memory., and you claim the fans are \"quieter than you'd expect from a 1070\" when it's known that the Aero 15X is the loudest of the new laptops.  \n\nAlso,  \n>As of right now, I dont think are any true competition for this laptop.  \n\nLet's not get silly.  ",
  "Thanks for the review. I'm replacing my AW13R3 with an Aero15x very soon.\n\nThe keyboard is my only concern (the AW had an awful trackpad that also needed precision drivers in order to make workable). I'm a software engineer so I type a lot and if I can't adjust it'll be a showstopper.",

Here's what I've been oogling over so far. \n\n* Asus Zephyrus M\n* MSI GS65\n* Razer Blade (2018)\n* Aorus X5 V8 <-- Leaning towards this one\n* Acer Triton <-- Leaning towards this one too\n\nThrough my research including on this subreddit, I've come to things I dislike about them all and was hoping you guys with these items can share your experiences and opinions about them. \n\n* Zephyrus\n   * Opening can cause issues - hair and other things can get in laptop easier\n   * 1-2 hour battery when not gaming\n* MSI GS65 \n   * Material flex \n   * Screen flex\n   * Keyboard flex\n   * Trackpad tracking oddities\n* Razer Blade\n   * Keyboard layout\n   * Rumored build quality issues \n   * Power brick issues\n* Aorus\n   * Haven't heard too much about it from actual users\n   * Bezels\n* Acer Triton\n   * I have no idea, I've heard nothing about it\n   * Only watched D2D Review\n   * Keyboard/Trackpad Location (WHY!!!)\n\nAnyway, please assist if you're so inclined. I'm up for other options too. \n\nThanks in advance",
  "Have you checked that none of them throttle?",
  "I guess that's not a huge concern for me as long as it doesn't affect gameplay that much. From what I researched it's not a huge impact on gaming. I guess if I was content creating (which I'm not) I'd be more worried about it, but it drops the frames like 5 to 10 FPS on average when throttled, but usually keeps the frames above 60 FPS for the games tested. For example the MSI throttles but still maintains FPS on high settings above 70 for most games. \n\nSo for now it's not a huge concern for me. ",
  "Your Review of HP pavilion 14 plus ew112TU? Questions \nIs it good for gaming ?\nIs it useful for a engineering student?\nHow long do these last?\nAny hinge problem?",

  "Is it really that bad atleast it will last for 4 years right?",
  "It might not be that bad, but 4yrs is questionable. Those cheap model has very weak hinge structure and I have encountered some machines that have their hinges broken after 3 years. \n\nSeriously, go find an used or previous gen business grade laptop, such as Thinkpad P1, HP Elitebook, or Dell Latitude.",
  "Bought the Snapdragon X Plus variant of the Ideapad Slim 5 for ₹56K—Here’s My Review ",
  "# My Experience (1 Week of Use)\n\nSetting up my workflow was a breeze. I’ve built projects using **Go and Docker**—no issues at all. Also used it for **note-taking, reading/editing PDFs, watching movies, and listening to music**.\n\nFor the past few days, it hasn't stuttered a bit while running the following **simultaneously for 4-5 hours**:\n\n* **WSL** (running Zellij & Neovim)\n* **Zen browser**\n* **Obsidian**\n* **Docker container**\n* **Syncthing**\n* **WhatsApp**\n* **Discord**\n* ...and much more\n\nI rarely shut down my device (only for updates/restarts), and **it loses just \\~2% charge in sleep mode**. The efficiency of this chip blows my mind.\n\nCompared to Intel & Ryzen laptops at this price, **battery life is unmatched, and performance is either on par or better**.\n\nAll my tools and applications are natively supported, **except Quick Share, which runs fine under emulation**. Also, the **Android-Windows ecosystem is seamless**, and I love it.\n\n#",
  "Got the same laptop and trackpad died within 2 months. Good luck.",
  "I watched a review of similar one from HP half a year ago and it was good only in native ARM apps, for x86 apps it was terrible, emulation did not work as smooth as on Macs. Have you tried x86 apps or they managed to rebuild everything into ARM during last 6 months?",
  "Does it support Hyper-V? If so, can it run X86 guests?",
  "Please provide a link how did  you get it for less",
  "Would you recommend it to a mobile and web developer? I'm using software like visual studio and android studio. Also laravel for some web dev.",
  "mate how is it for learning programming languages, and please share your experience with Python and data analytics software.",
  "# Downsides & Limitations\n\nOf course, nothing is perfect, so here are some quirks I found:\n\n* **No proper Android drivers** – I tried installing a custom ROM via `fastboot`, but the device didn’t show up. No solution yet.\n* **Android development on ARM is still rough** – It’ll take time before things become fully native.\n* **No OS change option** – Coming from Linux, this was frustrating. Snapdragon promised proper Linux support, but that still seems far away. That said, **WSL has been a lifesaver**, and Windows has been surprisingly pleasant for my use case.\n* **Gaming is not natively supported** – I don’t game, but knowing that most games won’t run natively is still a con. Hopefully, ARM gaming support improves.\n\nHonestly, the **biggest con I expected was Windows itself**—I assumed it would be painful after using Linux. But there are **great alternatives for most tools**, and I’ve actually been enjoying Windows. Didn’t think I’d ever say that!\n\n# Final Verdict\n\nFor ₹56K, this laptop is **an absolute steal**. It’s **comparable to a MacBook Air in build quality, performance, and battery life**—but with **more RAM & storage**. I’m really happy with my purchase.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask! 🚀",

Most of the software he might be using is MS Office, zoom/teams for meetings, and mainly a browser for multimedia and all of his stuff. \n\nAnd while this one is giving unmatched battery life without a charger and no lag, while being the same or more powerful than other i5/i7 12th gen devices, i was checking in the 40-50k price range. So this is where my search ends up... now i'm glad that you liked it, and it's good enough for a student to do basic stuff and multimedia.",

  "Thinking of Upgrading to HP OmniBook X (Snapdragon X Plus) – Advice Needed! Hi laptop community,\n\nThis is my first post in this community and I could really use your advice!\n\nI’m considering an upgrade and need some advice, especially from those who’ve used the new HP OmniBook X with the Snapdragon X Plus. There’s a deal going on at [Officeworks ](https://www.officeworks.com.au/shop/officeworks/p/hp-14-omnibook-x-snapdragon-x-plus-16-512gb-copilot-pc-hpfe1000qu)in Australia right now for this laptop.\n\n**Current situation:**  \nMy Lenovo Yoga 7 Slim Carbon 13\" (Intel i5-1135G7, 8GB RAM, 257GB SSD) is showing its age. Here are my main problems:\n\n* *Small SSD:* I regularly download and watch movies, but 257GB fills up fast.\n* *Slow performance:* The i5-11th gen feels outdated and sluggish.\n* *Low RAM:* 8GB isn’t enough for my workflow—I keep many job application tabs open and learn coding.\n* *Poor battery life* and unreliable keyboard (some keys need to be pressed VERY hard).\n* *Noise:* The single fan runs constantly and isn’t quiet.\n* After this experience, I’m pretty much done with Lenovo.\n\n**Why I’m considering the HP OmniBook X** Snapdragon X Plus\\*\\*:\\*\\*\n\n* It’s got a Snapdragon X Plus chip, which from what I’ve read should be super snappy and efficient (ARM chips = long battery life).\n* 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD solve my speed and storage issues.\n* Slick design and solid build quality—I’ve only heard good things about HP from friends and Officeworks reviews seem positive.\n* Hoping for much better battery life and a quieter, cooler experience.\n\n**My usage:**\n\n* Watching YouTube/movies\n* Learning coding and applying for jobs\n* Lots of browser tabs (mainly job portals)\n* Want a laptop that’s quiet, with solid battery, good keyboard, and enough power for everyday multitasking.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* How’s real-world performance on ARM Windows laptops? Any compatibility issues for daily use?\n* Is battery life genuinely as good as advertised?\n* What’s your experience with HP build quality and support?\n* Should I consider anything else before making the switch?\n\nAll thoughts, insights, and experiences are very welcome. Thanks in advance for the help!\n\n\\-------------------------  \nUsed perplexity to organize, gather my thoughts and create this post\n\n[HP OmniBook X Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus](https://preview.redd.it/jqkb1usvyzhf1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd6d40bd0a6a248242d1a0fc11db0186f4ba031c)\n\n",
  "These ARM chips are indeed super snappy - as you described. However, if you plan on gaming, I would steer clear as many games are simply not available yet.\n\nIf you don’t game, or know your games work, I would highly recommend. But check everything is compatible, or at the very least, will work via Prism.\n\nI personally have been daily driving a Snapdragon X Elite (but MS Surface) since November and absolutely love it. About 90 - 95% of apps I’ve come across have worked (I’ve tested hundreds for my job). The only ones that have problems are driver related (such as printers). But even then, many print vendors are supporting ARM now. \n\nIn terms of battery life and thermals - they’re sublime. It never gets hot and I’ve never heard the fan spin up (even while working in bed!). Battery lasts 8-10 hours I’m and I have to charge it roughly one every day and a half.\n\nSummary: for a work daily driver, I wouldn’t go back to x64-x86. Hopefully Microsoft can keep up the momentum.",
  "Personally ARM on microsoft is still not where it needs to be. Be prepared to get random compiling errors when coding if the VSC plugin even works to begin with.\n\nFun fact, when these snapdragon chips launched, the windows arm version of chrome just didnt work for two weeks. It was broken and you were relying on a third party vendor (google) to fix their shit.\n\nIf you want an arm device, mac is where it is. If you want x86 linux is where it is. If you want to game, windows is where it is.\n\nWindows on ARM is you running beta testing for software, firmware and hardware while paying for the privilege.\n\nAs for your current device, honestly the big hold back would be the ram. It likely is not enough so you are having to use the page file on your ssd which is slower and if you are running out of space on your ssd it would be even slower. Additionally it is likely not dual channel memory so it is kneecapping the processor's performance. In terms of the fan you could redo the thermal paste yeah that likely is not really fixable.",
  "Did you get omnibook x? Planning to get this one too",
  "Thanks so much for the detailed insight!   \nYour real world experience with snap is helpful, I’m not a gamer, so that side effect isn’t a big issue for me, but I’ll definitely double-check the specific software I need (i use vs code and someone mentioned not all plugins are compatible), and look into Prism compatibility.  \n\n\nI went to Officeworks the other day to try out the laptop, and I was impressed with its sleek aluminium build. The keyboard felt a bit odd to the touch, but that’s fine since I’ll be using an external keyboard anyway. I opened around 30 tabs—YouTube, Reddit, news sites, job portals—and there was a slight lag (which I expected), but it didn’t heat up and the fans never kicked in, which was nice!\n\nThe only letdown was the touchpad. It felt premium, but it didn’t always register my single-tap clicks, which got a bit frustrating. Still, I’ll be using an external mouse most of the time, so it’s not a dealbreaker for me.",

However there is not a single review anywhere online about the laptop (mainly interested in battery lief feedback as the 12700H does not have the best reputation for battery life with the exception of the XPS lineup).\n\nSo if anyone on this subreddit has this laptop/knows about this laptop I would really appreciate a review or a summary of what you think about the laptop as on paper it seems like one of the best options for me (apart from the zephyrus g14 which is a bit more expensive).\n\nThanks in advance :D",
  "I finally got my Inspiron 14 plus.\n\nSpecs:  \nIntel Core i7 13700h  \n32GB RAM  \nNvidia RTX 4050 6GB  \n2.5k WVA Display\n\nRates:  \nOverall performance 9/10  \nVery good for daily work and entertainment. Everything runs lightning fast. I use it for general use, programming and gaming.\n\nGaming 7/10  \nThe GPU is great for older games. I can run everything up to 2017 smoothly on ultra settings with 120+ fps. For newer games, though, I have to set everything for medium. Also, for proper gaming experience, you have to use a side monitor.\n\nScreen 7/10  \nIt's a great 90hz IPS screen. I would give 10/10 for working and general entertainment purposes, but it has a lot of ghosting on gaming. You may be fine if you're a casual gamer, though.\n\nBuild quality 10/10  \nI don't have a XPS to compare with, but I see no problems with the build quality. Eveything feels very premium and sturdy. Also, it's very lightweight and portable.\n\nTo wrap it up, I'm loving the laptop. It is exactly what I was looking for: a small, lightweight laptop focused on overall performance for programming and entertainment, but with some power for casual gaming. I did have the overheating problem as other owners had, but it was solved after installing all drivers and windows updates. The only con I see on this laptop is that it has only one USB-C port.

  "I think the build quality of Dells Inspirons are lacking. I don't know how it is on the plus model because there is literally no review and neither a product page I could inspect in Germany I didn't even know this existed a few minutes ago.",
  "Hi there,\n\nI have the Inspiron 14 Plus 7430 since yesterday. The config is Intel Core i7 13700h, 32GB RAM, Nvidia RTX 4050 6GB and the 2.5k Display with 300nits. That Laptop is a beast! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst: it runs every single of my games in Ultra and native display resolution such as HZD, Forza 5, Fifa 23, Uncharted, Cyberpunk and even Flight Simulator 2020. Yes the fans turn up but they are not nearly as loud as a PS4 when you try to play RDR2 :D. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond: In office use the fans stay off, but the device will run warm. This is good for winter when you have freezing hands :D I might get a bit too warm if you use it on your lap but overall its quiet, its snappy and the battery lasts about 4 to 6 hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general I like the 7430 because it now replaces my Xbox Series X and my beefy desktop PC. I can sell both and just use this company laptop for everything. Hook it up to a screen and you have a console :D. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I don't like is the power brick, its super ugly 130w from Lite-On, I wish they had a better design and the stupid LED keeps glowing no matter its plugged in or not.  I'd also prefer a very low constant spinning of the fan instead of a super warm device. Lenovo does that pretty good in the Pro 7 Slim series. Their fans are running but very low, you barely hearing them but the device stays cool with the similar 12600h CPU. \n\nFor gaming alone, I recommend this little bugger, half the price of a Zephyrus G14, twice as ugly as a G14 but in my opinion the same or maybe even more power but a better fan profile.",
  "Hey there! How is the laptop holding up for you? I am looking to buy one and this model has piqued my interest. I primarily use my laptop for coding, online meetings, browsing, watching videos, and office-related work, such as presentations, Excel, and Word. Will it be a good buy for me?",
  "[deleted]",
  "How is the laptop holding up after all these months? I'm also looking at a new laptop and doubting whether I'll get an XPS, Inspiron or MacBook!",
  "From what I can see on reviews of Inspiron non plus it seems to be pretty good, maybe not XPS level but definitely better than most. But yea I didn't know dell segregated the powerful inspirons and power efficiency focused inspirons into non-plus and plus.",
  "Hello there! Thanks for the review!\n\nCan't this fan thing be adjusted via software? It really would be nice to have the fans running low while doing light work. Also, did you try to update the bios and drivers? I read here at reddit that the heating problem can be easily solved by updating the software.\n\nI bought the same version you have, but it will arrive in 2 months.",
  "Thanks a lot bro for this review I appreciate you. How is the battery life ? I want to buy it and also did you try any other games like r6 siege and fornite ? How many fps if you did",
  "I am not gonna use it to game daily maybe once a week because I already have a series x I just want to know if it can handle games so I can play on it occasionally especially games that you can’t get on the series x such as Spider-Man and etc",
  "So, do you think temperature and fan noise could be a problem with time? I'm gonna use it for music production. I don't want that performance may be limited by built quality or lacking cooling system.",
  "Im planning on buying the same specs. Do you think it has a good build quality? Any hinge problems? And will the battery last longer for productivity work? I appreciate it.",
  "How's the screen quality?",
  "Hello. Sorry for the late reply.\n\nIt's been one year now, and the laptop is holding up great. Battery is fine, screen is fine, everything ok.\n\nFor your purposes, it will be the perfect laptop. Just go for it.",
  "I have not experienced anything like that on mine, it has a pretty beefy cooling system even on the version with integrated graphics. Mine has the i7 12700H, for the record, and the chip stays pretty cool all the time for me even during charging or playing games, although I normally don’t use it for that but I did try out Nier Automata and a few others to see if they were playable on the iGPU.",
  "It’s solid, I use it as my main portable Windows machine. I just wish 8GB of the Ram wasn’t soldered to the board. But I doubt that’s an issue for you. I also have an M1 (vanilla) 13” MacBook, though. It’s hard to say which is better without knowing your use case.\n\nEdit: it comes with 16GB, 8 as a stick of DDR5 and 8 is soldered.",
  "Yeah its not terrible at all but if your keyboard flexes alot while typing fast and hard it will be very annoying. Atleast competing products like a Pavilion Aero 13 in comparison to the Inspiron are better and stiffer built. The thing is the Inspiron has too much competition in its price range where all the other products are just slightly enough better to be considered over the Inspiron. No hate towards it, I was almost going to buy it but I found an used Matebook 14 with Ryzen 5 4600H, 16GB for 300€",
  "So far the only game that didn't run well was Starfield. Everything else runs very good at 1080p.",
  "Thankyou so much",
  "Thanks!!",
  "Sorry for the blast from the past - but how has it been holding up for you? Really interested in this laptop (without the dedicated gpu) but can't find much info online.\n\nAny issues the build/opening closing of the hinge?",
  "Agreed there are better options, but I need a dedicated graphics in as compact a laptop as possible. Which is why I originally looked at it.",
  "Over here, the Inspiron 14 plus with i7 12700H, RTX 3050, 16 GB RAM and 512 SSD costs ~~1.255,41 €~~. Price update End of July: 1.350 €.\n\nI tried to find something similar but end up much more expensive.\n\n**Edit**: I've ordered one as a business customer and got an offer for around 1.330 € (1.126€ without VAT), but including 3 years premium warranty on site and 3 years of accident insurance (i7, WinPro, 16 GB, GTX 3050, 512 SSD) . Nice deal. Curious how good the machine will be.\n\n**Edit 2:** My notebook has arrived. Short review after a few hours of use: Build quality of the frame is very nice, great looking laptop, pretty stiff and solid. Uncommon design of the trackpad which helps with overall stiffness.\n\nI haven't done any stress tests yet. While surfing and browsing the fans don't run. During installation it got quite warm and the fans worked a bit, but not on an anoying level.\n\nThe trackpad is ok. Not great I would say, but quite allright. Keyboard has a nice feel to it, a good mixture between snappyness and softness.\n\nI've installed a Samsung 980 pro 2 TB. No problems - figuring out how to open the case after removing the screws took me  a while though. \n\nI'll update this in the next weeks",
  "Ok thank you",
  "Battery life ?",
  "To be fair though, Starfield is very heavy and doesn't perform especially well on anything. Even my desktop with 6700xt + 5800x3d can't run the game half as well as it should be able to. Not to mention that Starfield runs worse on Nvidia GPUs.",
  "Sure thing, let me know if you have any more questions",
  "Nothing new to report really, I’ve not had any problems out of it. I use it and daily and haven’t had any problems with the screen, hinge, cooling/performance. I even play pc games on it occasionally (but wouldn’t recommend anyone buy it for that, as integrated Iris XE gpu is not as good as RDNA2 from Ryzen 6000 or even Ryzen 5000). I’m really happy with it though and haven’t found anything that would prevent me from recommending it as a general purpose, premium ultrabook.",
  "Nice specs a little pricy for the GPU though if you don't game heavily it is a great machine.",
  "Hi, don't want to bother but I was curious what you think 1 year later? Happy with your choice? Am seriously considering this laptop.",
  "you can read, no?",
  "I have a question. Does it make any abnormally high fan noise when having a heavy load? I am planning to get this but I also don’t want it to be making noise for doing average tasks and programming",
  "Well, in that form factor the pricing is quite alright.",
  "The ram can be expanded to how many gb?",
  "I don't have much comparison, I mainly use it on my desktop with a lenovo dock.\n\n\\*What I like\\*: the look of the laptop, the build quality, the unoldered ssd, the at least one piece of unsoldered RAM and the cheap price for the whole package. I got it as a business customer including 3 years of plus warranty and 24h-repair-at-home-service for around 1126€  without taxes. Comparable packages were more like 1600 - 2000€ with that kind of warranty.\n\nBenchmark speeds (CineBench at 12500) were quite good and with the 3050 I'm able to play games like RDR2.\n\nI use it for Graphic Design, Photoshop, Illustrator etc run quite well.\n\nThe screen is good, but not meant for use in sunlight.\n\nOverall I enjoy using the laptop and had no real technical issues yet.\n\n\\*What I don't like\\*: after many years as a desktop user the sound of spinning laptop fans can be a bit annoying. Not terrible but compared to any MacBook it's quite noticeable.\n\nPower management can be a bit confusing and I'm not sure if this is a Dell thing or a Win11 thing: there are at least 3.5 different ways/screens/settings + BIOS of adjusting the power management. Since this also impacts CPU speed I had to first understand how to set it properly.\n\nSometimes I can hear a bit of coil whine, but I usually wear headphones so I don't mind.\n\nI had to call german Dell service once after installing a bigger SSD and they were able to help within minutes.\n\n...\n\nUpgrades: 2TB SSD   \nRAM: Additional 32 GB so 40 GB in total\n\nI would pretty much agree with this test: [https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-Inspiron-14-Plus-7420-laptop-review-For-power-users-on-a-budget.643267.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/dell-inspiron-14-plus-7420-laptop-review-for-power-users-on-a-budget.643267.0.html)",
  "I have read above but maybe in 20 days it changed that’s why I am asking",
  "It's not very loud with the fans on full blast, no. I have a Nitro 5 15\" from Acer also and it's about 2x-3x louder than the Dell is. Although keep in mind, my Inspiron Plus did NOT have discrete graphics, just the 12700h with Xe integrated.",
  "I don't know I can't find any informations about this device in Germany.",
  "Hi bro if I buy the new model with the 4050 rtx 32 gb of ram you think I can play on it?",
  "I found it actually so the one 8gb ram seems to be fixed ie can't be removed then u can add another 32gb ram to make it max 40gb .\n\nhttps://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/inspiron-14-7420-laptop/inspiron-14-7420-setup-and-specifications/memory?guid=guid-e9d2ea83-38a4-431d-803c-96d63c1dbc34&lang=en-us",
  "I don’t see why not. 4050 is a beefy GPU relatively speaking. The one piece of advice I would give to anyone thinking of buying any laptop with a dedicated GPU is this-\n\nMake sure to check the wattage that the 4050 is configured at in the specific model you are interested in. I don’t know the exact range for the 4050 or other RTX 4000 series mobile GPUs but with the 3050/3050ti for example, those can be configured as low as 30w or as high as 95w, and the clock speed usually scales with the power draw. So a laptop with a 30 or 40 watt configured GPU would perform much worse than one with the full 95 watts for example. I doubt that Dell is running the 4050 at full clock speed, but you never know until you check the specs list of the laptop.",
  "Another person checking in, anything new to report with the Inspiron? Im thinking about getting one for college ",

  "HP Omnibook Ultra Flip Early Review; Amazing Hardware, Terrible Software (and maybe not the culprit you think) Recently picked up an Omnibook Ultra Flip as my new daily driver laptop to replace my \"aging\" XPS 15 9520 (reality is I wanted something that was as buggy). \n\n  \nTLDR at the end and feel free to ask specifics if you didn't read the whole thing, I won't be offended, this got super long.\n\n  \nI've had a LOT of laptops as daily drivers in the last few 5 ish years, somewhere in the realm of 12, and so far none of them have actually been stable from a software standpoint (aside from my Macbook Air, but I require Windows for most of what I do). So this mini-review (I always call them mini and then end up typing like 50 paragraphs, you've been warned) comes from a place of a lot of recent laptop experience. \n\n\n\n# Hardware\n\nOK starting with the good, wow, just wow, I can't say enough good things about the hardware on this machine, it is quite literally the best I've ever owned/used and that includes my Macbook Pro 14. This is just a wonderful machine and HP really knocked it out of the park, honestly for the price I'm surprised it's as good as it is; it's by no means a cheap machine but still. \n\n  \nKeyboard: I'm typing this away on the Omnibook right now and it's a joy to type on, as someone who is a bit of a mechanical keyboard nut, I can say this is pretty special considering how small it is. I would not rate it the best laptop keyboard ever (that goes to the Cherry switches on things like Alienware's offerings), but it's up there with the Macbook Pro in terms of how much I like it. It's clicky, responsive, easy to use, the backlighting is perfect, etc... I'm incredibly pleased with this. \n\n  \nTrackpad: another insanely good area, the trackpad feels great, is responsive, easy to use, the haptics are the best I've used (yes I prefer them over the Mac and Surface devices), it's HUGE for a 14 inch laptop, and has a nice texture to it that isn't too rough or too sticky/glossy. \n\n  \nDisplay: Another joy, as you'd expect from a high end OLED panel. It's beautiful, gets plenty bright for all but the brightest environments (think direct sun with sunglasses on), and being 120hz just adds to the premium feel. It's also a huge plus considering this thing actually can game relatively OK (more on that later). \n\n  \nSpeakers: I'd put these at the worst part of the hardware, but they aren't bad either, just not Macbook levels of quality. It has 4 speakers, they get plenty loud (really noise is not an issue) and sound relatively good, my main issue is a big lack of bass. I'm not surprised considering the form factor we are dealing with here though so I'll give it a pass. \n\n  \nCamera: I don't really use the cameras much on my laptops, but it's solid, nothing insane but you won't be let down. \n\n  \n2-in-1: Of course you get the flip because it's a 2-in-1, though I don't use it as a tablet that often, it is really nice to have the ability to do so. Nothing really special here, but it's easy to open and flip all the way around, the hinge feels sturdy, and there are magnets to keep the thing flat when you flip it all the way around (a nice touch that some other brands miss). \n\n  \nBattery Life: Well, as you'd expect, the battery is insanely good for a Windows machine. Lunar Lake really is fantastic and Intel finally did it, we finally have proper x86 that lasts all day, is power efficient, and still performs really well. I'm uber impressed on that front, as everyone has been with Lunar Lake machines so far. \n\n  \nPerformance: So far this has been another huge win, at least for it's size. I don't intend on gaming on it all the time, but I've tried a few, Destiny 2 is playable on the lowest settings at 720p (this sounds bad but D2 is not really known for being reliable), Deep Rock Galactic is an easy 70+ at it's lowest settings (I think you could get a pretty close to 60 FPS experience with a few settings on medium), Elder Scrolls Online was flat at 100FPS while on the lowest settings at 2560x1080 (external display), I didn't test hugely populated areas, but it didn't hitch at all so I think it's properly playable. \n\n  \nHowever, don't expect this to perform as well as other 256V laptops, it is power limited to some degree, so you really need to see benchmarks of this exact machine. This has been true for basically all gaming benchmarks for a few years now, not just on iGPUs, but dGPUs too, since you can't really know what wattage is being delivered without more directly checking. \n\n  \nThe other thing to note is that you get very very similar performance on battery vs plugged in, unlike Windows machines of the past, this is a huge plus and puts these much closer to how Mac's have been for a while.\n\n  \nNoise/Cooling: I'll say this, the fans are incredibly quiet, even under a super full load. However, they do turn on more than I would like. Even writing this review is causing them to spin up, they are audible in my extremely quiet bedroom, but nothing that is really bothersome. HP seems to have tuned this thing to keep temps around 70C, even under maximum load, which is great to see (means you'll never thermal throttle which often causes horrible hitching in games on thin and lights), but I think they could squeeze a bit more wattage at that GPU to get better gaming performance if they really wanted to.\n\n  \nPorts: This is pretty simple, you get 2 proper Thunderbolt 4 ports (which appear to have their own controller), I do wish that one was on each side, but you can't get everything and that would consume more space. Headphone jack is there too, which is good, can't believe some companies have gotten rid of that on laptops.\n\n\n\n# Software\n\nThis is where the let downs start though. I want to preface this by saying this; Windows is my favorite desktop OS, it always has been, and that hasn't changed, I would also put myself at like 75% of the way to an absolute expert on the inner workings of Windows, I don't know it all, but I love to dig on things like their hardware scheduler, deep event logs, etc... So I'm not some noob on that front. I also work in IT for a living, I'm quite good at troubleshooting and am used to Windows and it's reliability issues. \n\n  \nI can deal with some issues, but Windows, over the last few years, has gotten so bad I'm close to giving up on it. I'm convinced Microsoft doesn't even have developers anymore, it's all just AI produce spaghetti code, because things are not good. \n\n  \nLets start by listing my bugs I've had in the first 4 days of owning this machine, bulleted. Most of which I am confident are Windows related and not HP related (since most of them are bugs I've had on other Windows devices, though usually not so early in the setup process). \n\n*  Hard crash while playing Overwatch 2, I admit this one may be Intel and not Windows\n* Crash while the system was asleep, resulting in a reboot, so when I woke it nothing was there or open (I've had this on about 4 Windows machines in the last 2 years)\n* Thunderbolt Docked monitors going completely black for a few seconds, then resulting in odd blurry text\n   * This one required I unplug and plug the dock back in, and in fact 1 of the 4 times it did this (in 1 work day) required me to plug into another port, the same one wouldn't do anything but charge\n   * This is an Anker 577 known good and functional dock\n* The entire Bluetooth driver stack failed so hard while I was trying to join a meeting that Bluetooth options disappeared from quick settings and the settings app, as if I had no Bluetooth on the device at all\n* Bluetooth audio also completely crapped out, it was silent, and Chrome wouldn't play videos because it couldn't access the audio hardware\n* Bluetooth issues with my WF-1000XM5's where only a single earbud would pair so I had audio in one ear only\n\n  \nHere's the thing, many people, especially those in tech, are slowly moving to MacOS because of issues like the above list. It's become a nightmare to use a Windows device for anything, and that's really unfortunate because the OS has so much going for it, like I actually like Windows 11. \n\n  \nAnd for anyone that asks, the above issues were AFTER updating Windows and all drivers to make sure things were fully up to date. \n\n  \nThe one exception to that is the Bluetooth issues, but this leads to another problem. I have installed a new WLAN driver from Intel and so far it's been reliable, I hope this is the case. But that updated WLAN driver was not visible on HP's website, via Intel's Driver Assistant, or via Windows Update; the only place I could find it was the HP Support Assistant app, which then just installed the package from Intel. This is nuts to me, how would a normal consumer know to check 4 places for updates? And wouldn't the consumer assume the 2 hours of updates after first getting the device was enough? \n\n  \nThis leads right into my other software gripe, BLOATWARE, ohhhh the bloatware, I hate it. This machine had McAfee installed from the get go which already is enough to make me mad, but that is easy enough to remove. But it also had like 12 different HP apps, some of which needed updating, some of which just said \"a new HP app experience is coming soon\" and then would close, and ALL of which aren't needed. \n\n  \nI have since removed them all, but it's nuts to have so much pre-installed crap. I don't need \"myHP\" with AI experiences, I don't need HP Display Control (for external HP displays), I don't need HP Aware, etc.... the list goes on and it's just annoying. \n\n  \nThe one good thing about the software is that (other than the aforementioned WLAN driver) all drivers and software appear to be from Windows Update and the Windows Store, so in theory a fresh Windows install should be really easy to get running on this without issues. Which may very well be the direction I go, 1TB isn't really enough for me so I might grab a 4TB single sided drive and swap this one out, reinstall, and hope for the best. \n\n  \nIf I were a normal consumer I would have returned this by now, but I'm not, and I love the hardware, so I think I am going to stick to it even with all the issues. Especially since I think most aren't HP's fault,.\n\n  \nOK that was one long winded post, but I had to get my thoughts out in writing somewhere. \n\n  \nTLDR; Insanely good hardware, possibly the best in the Windows world right now, what a beauty. I'd HIGHLY recommend this machine, but only if you are OK with dealing with Windows and how horrible it's gotten recently. ",
  "Thanks for the thorough write-up!  I'm strongly considering one of these as well.  Shame about the software issues you experienced.  Sounds like a fresh Windows install straight away might be a good way to go to ensure a better experience.  I use a Pixel phone instead of a Samsung precisely because of bloatware - I don't want that crap on my laptop as well!\n\nMy current laptop has TB ports on each side, which means I can charge from either side.  Does the non-TB4 USB-C port on the other side also charge the laptop?  It's so convenient having that ability, so I hope so!\n\nThanks.",
  "Really appreciate this review as a student who needs a laptop ASAP and has been strongly considering this or this year's Spectre x360. Aren't many reviews out of it yet. \n\nCould you comment on the 2-in-1 a bit more? Does it feel comparable to an iPad Pro or an Android tablet with their respective pens when writing? How is the Windows implementation of the tablet mode?",
  "Here's [my review of it](https://smbtech.au/features/hp-omnibook-ultra-flip-14-laptop-review/), if you're interested in comparing!",
  "Hi, thanks for quick review. Does this machine allow to set battery charge limit to 80%?",
  "Buyer’s beware. Received mine today and did a fresh install of Windows. It immediately bricked the touchpad. I have run all Windows updates, installed Support Assist and the model is not listed on their support page so manually installing drivers is not available either. I’m stuck with a new laptop with no usable trackpad or external mouse. Basically everything was rendered unusable except the keyboard - no touchscreen even. I suppose it’s too new so they don’t have the exact model available for driver updates. This is my fault since I shouldn’t have reinstalled Windows. I’m waiting/hoping HP fixes this.",
  "Thx for the awesome review ! I am tempted to it to try out the OmniBook Ultra flip as well but I just wished they made a 16inch version. Maybe they'll refresh it as the Spectre lineup had one as well.\n\n14 inches is great for portability but for my workloads (coding/spreadsheets) I would appreciate the extra screen real estate. Surprised to hear the speakers are the worst part, seems HP did cut some corners vs the Spectre lineup which had probably some of the best top firing speakers in any windows laptop.",
  "Apparently drivers etc have been fixed, as mine had absolutely no issues setting up. Fantastic haptic touchpad, oled screen, and keyboard. Overpriced, but nice laptop. Not sure about battery life yet, but think it is not anywhere near the ARM versions, which I did try out.",
  "Thanks for the review! Was an awesome read.",
  "Great review. This model is most interesting lunar lake laptop for me.",
  "Is there a screendoor effect on the screen? How bad is it? Also, how's the screen's reflectivity.",
  "Please can you make some Linux testing on this unit ?",
  "great writeup. i will be following this since i just ordered the 32gb ultra 7. but i disagree on the blame, ultimately it is hp's problem since they shipped it.\n\ni wish oems would just ship vanilla windows and a small partition with drivers. i'd pay extra for a bullshit-free experience.\n\ni saw a couple youtube reviews that show thermal throttling though that has me worried on such a pricey laptop.",
  "Does anyone know if the difference between the 256v and 288v is significantly different?",
  "Glad to hear about this! I wish I could have got this instead of an envy but I I unfortunately had a low budget and found it for 600 at Bestbuy.  I heard they've had improved build quality for the 2024 release. The Omnibook sounds like a great 2 in 1 tho!",
  "Thank you a lot with this greate feedback on the laptop. Very detailed and interesting. I'm looking to replace my too bulky of a gaming laptop with one thin and litgh and a desktop. Also want to be able to scketch stuff on the fly on the laptop directly form my projects and designs. Not going with a proper tablet here as I still want to be able to run some CAD software and thinker with SSH and random stuff like that.\n\nI read that you reinit windows and returned the laptop already. \n\nMay I ask the exact reason you where still unhappy ? Like BT issues were gone but not the thunderbolt ones. And on which laptop your eyes landed now ?",
  "Hi, I bought the same laptop, custom built through HP, and had to return it and I’m currently waiting for my replacement this week. I returned it because Bluetooth did not work. There were corrupt drivers. You know much more about computers than I do, but I did everything I could and worked with HP remotely over two days to try to fix the problem and they agreed it could not be fixed, so the laptop went back. I had updated the newest version of Windows 1124H2, and wondered if that could’ve been the problem. Now when I get the new laptop, I will be afraid to update Windows. I loved the laptop so much that I’m willing to take a chance with this replacement. Do you think I am correct to be leery of updating Windows?",
  "Sort of a reply to u/Wormminator  's 'its a shit device' and a general reply\n\n  \nAlso bought from HP DE , 1330,- for the 258V/1TB version. \n\nMy comparison is my Lenovo Yoga 14 Gen7 (Ryzen 7 6800U), also recently had the near identical just updated Yoga 14 Gen9 (8640HS) here and set it up for somebody.\n\n  \nOut of the box i only switched it on to see if everything works. Then format and fresh install. So i cant say anything about the pre-installed HP Software, Bloatware or out of the box drivers. Unfortunately the bloatware and stuff are quite common these days, and not limited to HP. Always do that though with a new device that comes with a pre-installed OS. For a novice that part is ofc a clear negative. \n\n  \nThe speakers are probably rather meh, yes. Idk if they were significantly better on the spectre, but tbh on a convertible thats not something i care about. 98% of the time if i even have/need sound then its via a headset anyway. My previous HP Elite X2 convertible also came with 'Sound by Bang & Olufson' markings ... but in reality, yeah ... haha\n\n  \nI did not encounter any WiFi or BT problems so far. As i said, fresh install. Dl'd WLAN, BT, Graphics and Touchpad drivers from HP, the rest i let windows do. WLAN you need for installation already anyway if you dont use a LAN dongle. \n\nNoticed that the touchpad does not work during installation though. So that is not yet supported by outofthebox windows installation.\n\n  \nI have to admit that so far i did not really test Wifi reception at fringe spots or something. However i also did not notice any signal problems.\n\nAs far as Bluetooth goes, i use a Logitech MX Anywhere, Anker In Ears and Sennheiser Momentum 4 Headphones. In this first week i did not notice anything amiss there.   \n(side note: what i have disabled in device manager - Sound Video and Game Controllers: the Intel Smart Sound technology for BT. That could be a cuplrit for some BT issues maybe? That stuff i had issues in the past with on other devices and it doesnt do anything i miss, so auto disable for me. If so, thats on Intel.)  \nMy Yoga actually had, still has, some very odd BT issues that only creep up every few weeks, sometimes months even. Fixed by a restart though. Never nailed down that. So i ll hold off a 100% clear yet, but so far ... fine. \n\nI do not use a TB dock, or even 2ndary monitors on this device, its purely portable, so thats a part i cant say anything about.\n\nThe keyboard. I like it. I read that the Spectre had more travel. That was obviously sacrificed for the mm the Omnibook is thinner. So yeah, i take if somebody is used the last gen Spectre then it might be a let down. Whats bad on all convertibles i know and had so far are the arrow keys. But that comes with the form factor \\*shrug\\*\n\nComing from the Yoga i do like the Omnibook keyboard better though.  \nMy small gripes are with the layout. The smaller Enter key (Yoga had a bigger one) and the DEL not being in the right upper corner, instead the Power being there \\^\\^  \nBut thats a matter of getting used too.",
  "Damn you. I'm getting it. \n\nThank you",
  "I prefer the HP to the surface laptop 7. For me, the keyboard on the HP Omni book is amazing (and even better than the already good surface laptop 7 keyboard, which I feel requires just a little too much pressure to press with a spongier feel rather than a tactile feel of the HP. Furthermore, the 14-inch size of the HP vs the 13.6-inch size of the Surface does make a difference in terms of ergonomics (the palm rest area is easy to rest my hands completely on while the surface laptop's palm rest is just a little too small.\n\nI would say the display on both the surface laptop and the HP are very good. Some say the HP Display is too dim, but I would say brightness is very good (unless you are directly out in the sun on a bright summer day). The display resolution is good on both, but the 14-inch display on the HP allows for just a little extra information to show on screen compared to the surface laptop 13.6 inch. Though the touchpad on the Surface is haptic allowing for a consistent press across the surface, the HP's mechanical touchpad is very good with a stiff and consistent press while allowing for more precise movement of the cursor compared to the smoother surface touchpad (which can cause mis clicks when moving the cursor quickly to press on a smaller icon)\n\nThe webcams on both the surface and HP are good, but the 5mp webcam on the HP stands out as having a better image quality.\n\n  \nOverall, I view the HP as a good device. It is also on sale currently at Best Buy and Microcenter.",
  "You are awesome, thanks for the review buddy",
  "Great review! \n\nWill likely get it for my in-laws since it's on sales at Best Buy.  Since they will pay bills and surf the web, this should be a good buy based on your review.  \n\nI hope that I can remove all the bloatware for them.",

Given all three share the same chip, I guess the deciding factors for me are temp, fan noises and bluetooth connection. I have a HP Zbook G7 from work and the bluetooth connection is absolutely terrible. On the other hand, after watching lots of reviews, the Zenbook has loud fans while the 7 Slim Aura can heat up a bit. Does any one here have experience with the Zenbook or 7 slim Ultra?",

  "I have this laptop for about a week now (Intel 258V with 32GB RAM). Some comments on it, apart from what has been already told:\n\n\\- It comes with lots of bloatware, especially HP software that repeats functions done by other software or does not add anything. I did a full Windows reinstallation, but some HP software is installed automatically via Windows Update (I will probably try to block WU from installing drivers automatically and see if it makes a difference).\n\n\\- I am still trying to understand how the presence sensor works. Apparently both (Intel Human Presence and Quantum HP Camera) need the camera switch to be open. I thought only the latter needed it and the former worked differently, but the sensor only works when the camera is not obstructed (which is a bit annoying if you care about privacy and wants to leave the physical switch closed).\n\n\\- I am also confused why the laptop, when in tablet mode (screen rotated more than 180 degrees) does not respect TDP values configured by MyHP \"Power Saver\" profile. On normal mode, it reaches 8.5W but once the screen is flipped, the minimum becomes 22W. More details here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1he14gk/why\\_windows\\_11\\_in\\_tablet\\_mode\\_consumes\\_more\\_power/](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1he14gk/why_windows_11_in_tablet_mode_consumes_more_power/)\n\n\\- Testing the battery, I would say I am satisfied. It was not 18 hours like some ads were saying, but I used for an entire afternoon (testing things and installing programs) and it had 50% when I turned it off. The following morning I continued my tests until the laptop shut itself off. I'd say it lasted for about 8h to 10h, but I think lighter tasks such as watching videos or office apps will give a bit more run time.\n\n\\- Finally, I tried running Ubuntu 24.10 on it with different kernel versions: 6.11, 6.12 and 6.13-rc1. Also, MESA was updated to 25-devel. The laptop starts super fast (in less than 3 seconds), but it has \"micro stutters\" every few seconds. Also, the webcam does not work or other features like the fingerprint sensor. Of course, it is also disabled on Windows (I ran dual boot) because Secure Boot needs to be disabled in the BIOS.\n\n The laptop is super nice, but it does need more polishing on the software side and Linux support will probably take a bit longer until it's more stable.",
  " Just got our HP OmniBook Ultra Flip in the mail 3 days ago. Custom Build, 32GB RAM, Intel Core 7 (258V), 1TB Gen 5 PCIe & Atmospheric Blue 😳 It is the best looking color and laptop I've laid eyes on! I have had ZERO issues with mine. ZERO. Finally tested just about everything yesterday. I am using it to run our popular eSIM Studios YouTube Channel. Using it for audio production, video editing, Live streams, graphic design, and general entertainment and office use. Not a gamer at all so I could care less about gaming. \n On my 4th day today and I can say I am very, very impressed with this HP machine. I originally purchased the HP OmniBook X but ultimately returned it due to incompatibility with some core apps and programs I use due to the Snapdragon ARM chipset. Have to have X86. Plus it is nice to have a full 360 degree rotation for tablet use. I have an unboxing of the device on my eSIM Studios YouTube Channel and will do reviews and progress update videos every couple of months. I will upload my initial review video next week. So Far, So Good! This thing is incredible! Not 1 issue. It is a beast and looks beautiful! I call it \"beauty & the beast\" LoL\n*Please let me know if anyone has any questions on the device or need me to check something out on the machine.",

  "I just bought the Omnibook Ultra Flip and have two major flaws that are making me want to send it back: \n\n1) The haptic touchpad keeps locking intermittedly and it's maddening. I use a resting thumb for bottom clicking and my point finger for moving the cursor. Every 5-10 clicks with my thumb, the click locks up and stays that way until I lift my fingers completely off the touchpad and reset them.\n\n2) The battery is draining fast. I had it in sleepmode over night with the lid closed and it drains 20% by morning. While using it for simple email and browsing, it drains about 1% per minute. I have the screen brightness way down only have chrome open. \n\nAny suggestions for fixing these two issues?",

  ">Sounds like a fresh Windows install straight away might be a good way to go to ensure a better experience.\n\n  \nYeah I would highly recommend this, I'm still having issues today with the Bluetooth, it seems like (haven't done enough testing to be 100% sure) that BT fails every time the device goes to sleep. Turning BT off and back on seems to fix it though (rather than a full reboot like that one time I mentioned in the review). \n\n  \nAll 3 can be used for charging, I'll admit I haven't tested the left side one but it has a charging LED next to it that doesn't light up when the right side is plugged in, so I'm sure it's supported.",
  "OK update #2, the issues with the Thunderbolt dock aren't gone. However, if all the other issues are resolved, I'm probably fine with this and don't really know who to blame since like 12 of 12 of laptops I've had in the last 5 years have had issues with Thunderbolt docks.",
  "As an update, I did a fresh install just now, I will report back if I have the same issues, if I forget to come back and update, that means the issues were fixed lol. \n\n  \nSo far though after the reinstall my headphones connected quickly, both worked, they sound better, and nothing weird is happening. \n\n  \nFair warning, the latest Win11 ISO doesn't have drivers for the wifi (or trackpad or touchscreen for that matter) so you have to use a USB C to ethernet adapter or install the driver during setup.",
  "So did you get an answer to the charging through the non-TB4 USB-C Port? I concur, charging from both sides is very convenient. Thanks.",
  "Yeah happy to provide some feedback. \n\n  \nI've also since reinstalled Windows and am hoping this fixes most of the software issues I was having with it, we shall see though. \n\n  \nAs for the 2-in-1, it's great, but it's also worth keeping in mind that a 2-in-1 will never be the same as a proper tablet just because they are always bigger and heavier. It feels fine in the hand, but it's by no means an iPad in terms of comfort using (primarily due to weight). \n\n  \nTouch input is fantastic though and from what I've read the pen input is great (this does NOT come with the pen though).\n\n  \nWindows is OK as a tablet OS, it does adjust things to be bigger and easier to use, and the onscreen keyboard is usable, however not all applications do that, so just keep in mind that some applications might still be hard to interact with. Firefox, as an example, I don't think changes anything when you're in tablet mode.",

  "I would agree but a completely fresh Windows install didn't resolve the issues, using drivers direct from Intel also didn't.

I talked to a few other people with different brands of Lunar Lake laptops and they also saw some really odd stability issues, specifically around Thunderbolt. \n\n  \nI also never got thermal throttling, the CPU temps are like 70C max on this thing, it power limits well before it thermal limits.",

  "Yeah the BT issues were still present just not as bad and I was also getting some BSODs. And yes the thunderbolt issues were still there too. \n\n  \nI still think this is mostly Intel's fault, bad drivers on a new platform and all. \n\n  \nFor now I am back on a bulky gaming laptop.",
  "I personally don't think the 24H2 update had much to do with the BT issues, I personally think it's more likely related to the Intel wifi drivers. \n\n  \nI'd personally say update to 24H2 again, but maybe give it a few days before doing so to see if the BT is better or not, then you'll know for certain if it was related to the update or not.",
  "And finally the Display. Well, its an OLED. I am used to that from the Yoga too, and i do have an OLED TV as main monitor on my desktop. So thats a bias i guess.\n\nSpec wise the displays are very similar. Same res, same brightness. Only the yoga just had 60/90Hz refresh options while the Omnibook supports 120hz. Both use PWM like nearly all OLEDs. The Omnibook has a slightly higher frequency there according to reviews. Also is uses DC dimming which softens the issues of PWM slightly afaik.\n\nThat said, somebody who cant deal with OLEDs or is susceptible to PWM probably isnt a fan of the Display. But that is an up front buying decision.\n\nAs far OLED screens on these type of devices go i can not fault it.\n\nIf there were an option for a very good IPS screen i probably would prefer that too though. But it would also need to be a 400-500nit screen, with decent contrast, even screen and no IPS bleed. In that sense its far harder to get a good IPS screen than an OLED. The OLED imo has always the better, punchier image. The main point of the IPS for me would be the lesser power needs.\n\nThat brings me to the pen input. Works. I m not painting nor am i a heavy pen user. Its just neat sometimes for some notes or sketches or even just signing.  \nAgain, i ll have to get used to the new pen. Its slightly lighter than the Yoga's. I would prefer it to be a bit heavier, and i have to get used to the not very prominent buttons. A big plus is however that its now USB-C rechargable. The pen of the Yoga 14 Gen 9 i recently set up still used batteries like the one from my older Yoga.\n\nThe connectivity with just 3 USB-C isnt perfect. I would not mind at least an old fashioned USB-A, and a HDMI port is also useful.\n\nHowever to be honest i only have like one or two USB-A to USB Micro devices/cables i still use. a new cable for that and thats that. HDMI i barely use, and i have a port on a small Adapter/Hub i usually have with me.\n\nThe only actual issue i had so far is a scaling issue of the mouse pointer. The default windows scaling is set to 200%, which i use. On startup the mouse pointer is like twice the normal size. Normal as soon the scaling is toggled back and forth.  \nSo thats a driver issue which i expect to go away.\n\nI might switch in the SK Hynix P31 2TB SSD i had put in my Yoga. The Samsung 1TB runs a little hotter, but ok. And i should be ok with 1TB for now. But if, that ll mean a new install again anyway \\^\\^\n\n\n\nIn summary i can say that i ll keep the Omnibook Flip. Its not perfect, but tbh none of the last 3 convertibles i had (Yoga 14, HP Elite X2, Surface Pro) were perfect in all regards. A convertible is a compromise device. That said, by now i feel that the biggest compromise on both the Yoga or Omnibook Flip for me are its tablet mode. Chunky, but workable. The Surface Pro or Elite X2 were better in that department as detachables, however were generally weaker with lesser runtime and not so well suited in all situations (dont really stand well on your lap, etc ..).\n\nMy use case favors laptop use, but a little tablet use is welcome. If its reversed, a detachable is better.\n\n\n\nAs far as comparison to normal, also lightweight, Notebooks/Ultrabooks goes. Yeah, there are better, better performance, better configs (esp. with dGPU), larger batteries ... but not significantly so if you want a convertible.\n\nThe only reason for a Spectre of last gen imo is really just if you need that tad bit more power that the Ultra 100 has over the 200 Gen. Or maybe a Gen 9 Intel Yoga with also Ultra 100, or the AMD Variant with Ryzen 8000.\n\nI did eye the Asus ProArt very shortly, but only because of the Ryzen AI CPU, but way too expensive imo.\n\nPersonally i find the slightly weaker (in Multicore, but slightly better in Single) CPU with better  iGPU (comparable to AMDs 780M/880M) and lower power consumption perfect for my needs.\n\nIf you want more power one might want to wait for Lenovo to refresh its AMD convertibles with Ryzen AI CPUs or maybe HP also using AMD eventually (it does after all in the non-flip Omnibook).\n\n\n\nP.S: my main reason for buying it is that i need a convertible for somebody else, who now will get my old (2y) Yoga 14. Otherwise that would not be a reasonable 'upgrade'.\n\n\n\nP.S.S: that turned out longer than expected , i ll also post this as general reply ;D",

But again the fans are incredibly quiet, near inaudible so I wouldn't really put that as an issue. \n\n  \nIt is a little bit of a shame that a chip this efficient isn't mostly fanless like Mac's have become, but it's hardly a dealbreaker.",
  "Definitely test it a lot before you decide to stick with it. \n\n  \nI am sadly returning mine. \n\n  \nNo new issues, so I stand by everything I said in this, but it's just not something I'm OK with on a brand new machine. \n\n  \nBut, if you don't have software issues like I did, it's a fantastic machine.",
  "Well, I may not be returning it, I'm unsure so far. I've found some other people with Lunar Lake having major issues on other laptop brands, so I am thinking it's going to be fixed with drivers, maybe. \n\n  \nAs for battery life, it was fantastic, like \"don't think about it\" levels of battery life, was very very impressed with it. Can't believe I didn't touch on that more in the review lol, oops. \n\n  \nHowever, it is NOT going to be as good as the Snapdragon stuff, nothing x86 is really going to beat that, it's closer than you'd expect, but ARM is just SO efficient.",
  "Hi, same situation here being a student. Not so crazy about gaming tho, have you considered the book5? If not, why? I am currently between this and the book5, really dont know which one to choose.",
  "[deleted]",
  "Hey, I saw you picked the omnibook over the zenbook s 14. I’m between the two now. How’s it been going with yours?",
  "The battery life is significantly better, lasts about 40% - 50% longer. Whether that is worth upgrading is something for you to decide.",
  "i think those might only be the 2.2k screen, not the oled ones, im looking at those now too. you can get the 32g 1tb, oled on hp website for 1350",
  "I'd say that is a complex question to answer, since I had so many software issues with it, which appear to mostly be related to Intel's drivers for LunarLake. \n\n  \nI actually returned mine because of these issues, it just wasn't stable enough. I'm sure it'll get there, but it's worth noting.",
  "I had been looking at the Thinkpad T14s that came out in August 2024, but the Best Buy sale on the HP Onnibook Ultra, 32gb/1TB for a cheap $899.  Couldn't resist.  Replacing a 2017 360 Spectre with cracked screen and damaged speakers and occasional connectivity issues.  Can't wait to change it over.",
  "There is no screendoor effect. The screen is quite reflective.",
  "Not that I was able to see, and I am pretty sensitive to that. \n\n  \nReflection wise, it is a very glossy display, as most touch OLEDs are, so it definitely reflects a lot.",
  "I mention a few of those in the review. \n\n  \nESO was playable, Overwatch was rough, Destiny 2 was probably playable but I wouldn't want to do high level content with it. \n\n  \nKeep in mind this is a power limited 256V, so it's not going to perform as well as some other models with the same exact chip.",
  "I don't play League so I didn't test it, but I am guessing it will run pretty well on it, considering Destiny 2 was close to/barely playable, League takes a lot less resources. ESO also ran on it pretty smoothly at lowest settings (like nearly 100FPS).",
  "I had the 16GB 256V model, it was quite solid, the other model I think has 32GB of RAM and a 258V which isn't much faster but does have the double RAM.",
  "i went with 258V 32gb. No problems with setup.",
  "I've also been a Mac user for a while now, unless you have specific needs for Windows, I don't think you'd be unhappy with a Mac. There are things that I dislike about it vs Windows but nothing is really a dealbreaker. \n\n  \nFor me I have to have Windows for a long list of reasons, but for most people that isn't the case and it's honestly becoming a more and more trashy OS.",
  "drivers appear stable. Use Revo Uninstaller to uninstall anything. Suggest the AMD Omnibook Ultra instead; it is much faster and better battery life.",
  "This won’t help with the return, but seeing your comment above if you are planning to buy the non-flip instead you should be able to find it at Best Buy. Their return policy is much better than HP themselves.",
  "Ummmm I don't think so, it may have a setting in BIOS which I didn't explore, but I don't recall seeing anything like that in the built in software.",
  "Wolltest du etwas sagen, oder nur Recht haben?\n\nDie Freiheit besteht doch darin, zu sagen, was man zu sagen hat und nicht darin, zu sagen, was andere hören wollen.\n\nJeder hat seine Prioritäten und ein Samsung OLED ist nun mal kein mattes Display. Kann man aber für ein paar Euro mit einer Folie versehen und hoffen, dass DEIN Problem dann gelöst ist. \n\nVon daher... nicht aufregen. \n\n  \nFrohe Weihnachten.",
  "I believe mine had a 60hz option, can't recall 100% though since I returned it, sorry!",
  "If OS doesnt matter to you then a Mac is an alternative sure. But its also no convertible. And if you want no convertible why would you consider the Omnibook Flip in the first place?\n\nI would rather make that a decision between the normal Omnibook (more potent) and the Macbook Pro then. \n\nPersonally i would make that mainly an OS decision, and i probably would not want to stick with one OS on most/all of my devices if there is no real good reason to do otherwise.",
  "A good chunk. \n\n  \nThey use the same GPU, but from what I've read the 288v pushes the power budget a lot higher. \n\n  \nHowever, I'm not sure they will be that different on this specific laptop model, I'm not sure the cooling system can handle much more than how far the 258v GPU is pushed.",
  "I had those options in the Windows settings for the touchpad, for reference I always set 3 finger tap to middle mouse button and it worked on this unit just fine.",
  "Not sure if it's got the stuff for facial, I think it does though. \n\n  \nI didn't find issues with the fingerprint myself though so maybe try re-training it?",
  "Are those issue still there in ubuntu?",
  "is it really gen5 ssd compatible ? I hate when laptop takes time to boot up I like everything to fire up really fast and was looking for a laptop with gen5 available with speed of 10,000 compared to gen 4 7000max could you give us a feedback on the ssd ? also since I want more multi core performance I am thinking of waiting on the AMD RYzen 7 AI version of the Omnibook X FLip to come out soon but the downside is AMD Ryzen7 AI only supports gen 4 ssd",
  "have u tried a bluetooth device to verify no disconnections problems?",
  "I think I would choose the Ultra Flip between those two. \n\n  \nAs for the dual boot, I don't see a reason why you wouldn't be able to, most systems support that. I haven't directly tested it but I highly doubt there is anything blocking it.",
  "Yes, dual boot is perfectly possible, although you have to disable Secure Boot and is going to lose Windows Hello and Fingerprint scanner (I don't remember if it's possible to reconfigure them after disabling Secure Boot).\n\nKeep in mind that Linux is not super stable at the moment. I tried with Ubuntu 24.10 and kernel 6.11, 6.12 and 6.13-rc1 last December and I had micro stutters on the system. Some stuff, like the webcam, didn't work too.\n\nLunar Lake is very new. I believe it will get better soon",
  "i dual boot it with fedora.  initially i needed to use usb for wifi and an external mouse, but after i did an update, it detected the built in wifi and haptic trackpad with no issues (Linux fedora 6.12.8-200.fc41.x86\\_64),  the experience  after the update has been great, better than i expected. (wifi, haptic trackpad, pen, screen all work).  i'd highly recommend linux for his machine, it's quiet and performant....  good luck!",
  "With how many issues I had with mine Omnibook, I think I would go with Lenovo. \n\n  \nWhile I'm not sure that these issues were HP's fault, and some if not all will probably be fixed, I still think I'd choose something else if I was to do it over again.",
  "I ended up returning this machine. \n\n  \nBut battery life was solid, modern standby is better now than it was before (when it's not being buggy), but it's standby power usage still isn't going to be as good as ARM based machines.",
  "I personally don't like matte protectors. I DO like matte displays, but I feel protectors just kinda don't look great. \n\n  \nThe ideal is an anti reflective but still glossy coating like we are seeing on some devices.",
  "You should only need Pro if you need the machine to be joined to a work domain or need to have Hyper-V running. So generally speaking there isn't a need for this.",
  "I am not using this machine anymore, but it's common to see that issue. Is it before boot up or a notification in Windows? \n\n  \nGenerally it's fine, they just like to push their own chargers and cover their asses in case people use chargers too weak to keep them fully charged.",
  "Yeah I get you on that, I've since moved to a 16 inch machine myself. \n\n  \nI'd personally recommend the Omnibook 16 inch one more, but that's just me.",
  "I am not sure about number 1, but number 2 is a common issue with Windows and Modern Standby, so the laptop itself isn't really to blame for it. As for fixing it though, it can sometimes be near impossible, Windows will try to run things in the background and wake the laptop. \n\n  \nAt this point I just shut my laptops down whenever I am going to put them in a bag. It's annoying, but it's the only way to keep them from overheating and waking in the backpack.",
  "I returned mine, so can't speak to how good it is now. But I would think after this much time they've resolved most of the issues. I would just test things thoroughly.",
  "I didn't end up testing that so I'm not quite sure, sorry!",
  "It's been a while since I had this machine, but a lot of it should be removable yes.",
  "I didn't have the pen so unfortunately I can't comment on that, touchscreen worked great with my finger though.",
  "Would you recommend a 16gb ram 256gb ssd MacBook Air m3 over the hp omnibook ultra flip. Asking before my omnibook flip ships so I can cancel if need be",
  "Im thinking of getting this laptop, and its on sale atm, have you verified that charging works on all the ports by now?",
  "I got tired of fighting with thunderbolt on various laptops.  I picked up this Omnibook and run a separate USBC->Displayport cable direct to the monitor.  The benefit is I can run the full 144hz on my monitor with variable refresh rate.  I haven't had one instance of video dropping since moving away from thunderbolt dock video.  I use the other USB-C port for a Anker USB-C Hub.  I got the 11-1 which has its own power supply for the USB-ports to allow quick charging when the laptop is off, and it has passthrough charging - I plug the laptop power supply into the hub and it goes uninterupted to power the laptop through the same port.  This works SO MUCH better than any Dock with video.  If you already have a thunderbolt dock you could probably just use that for the peripherals and charging, and still use the other USB port for video.\n\nRecap -\n\nUSB-C Port 1: Video\n\nUSB-C Port 2: Hub (Data and charging)",
  "Oof. Thanks for the heads-up, I really appreciate you following up. I'll grab a usb-c ethernet adapter off Amazon, handy to have one anyway. \n\nFingers crossed it fixes the Bluetooth troubles!",
  "Please tell me where you found the drivers for the trackpad and touchscreen lol I can’t find anything.",
  "Yes, and I ended up buying it so I can confirm myself that you can charge from all three of the usb-c ports. The convenience of charging from either side is great.",
  "Thanks for the reply. Interesting that yours didn't come with the pen as the listings here in the UK include it (still pre-order tho). Maybe it's a regional thing?\n\nI've read that other MPP 2.0 pens are better and can be used with these (at least with the Spectre) but seems like it'll be good enough.\n\nHopefully the apps I use will be decent in tablet mode.",
  "I have the unit from Best Buy, sans pen. I bought the correct hP pen (MMP 2.0) but do not seem to be able to configure the buttons on the pen. The HP pen app I downloaded does not seem compatible. Do you know if there is a dedicated app to set up the pen for the Flip?",
  "What about the hinge is it plastic or metal or like anchored into plastic since they crack and break finally",
  "Yes I meant the Spectre model that was released early this year with Meteor Lake",
  "Yes I meant the Spectre model that was released early this year with meteor lake",
  "[removed]",
  "So no software problems on your device? Thank you!",
  "Problem solved. OP shared the product page with the drivers which mostly solved the issues. Still can’t detect the camera but I haven’t troubleshooted that yet. Just a frustrating process since HP’s own app doesn’t detect any driver issues thus doesn’t download anything for you and it’s very hard to located the correct product page. Most important features are working - trackpad, touchscreen and USB ports.",
  "[deleted]",
  "Customizable version from HP website. 258V. Best trackpad I have used; don't know about other configs.",
  "I have tested thunderbolt docks, connected multiple external monitors, ethernet, usb drives and everything worked for me. No BT issues or BSOD. Everything works as expected.",
  "Scaling with Brave browser was sometimes off and would have to change it.",
  "Just josh on Youtube said it does.",
  "ok, thx bro",
  "So what laptop are you using now?",
  "Have you noticed that the power is limited to 30 watt? No matter which power profile. Hurts gaming a lot.",
  "I got one a few days ago. Other than the lack of auto-rotation, it's an excellent Linux 2-in-1. The fingerprint reader worked out of the box, and I got the IR camera working with Howdy for facial recognition with minimal tinkering.  \nI'm a .NET Framework developer professionally, so I have configured it for dual-boot with all of my employer's corporate spyware contained on the Windows partition and all of my personal computing on Fedora. Perfect! 🤓",
  "that's good to hear, i'm seeing conflicting info on the throttling, this reviewer is showing temps that hover closer to 90c https://youtu.be/p3KgUU4dbxQ?si=bNdOZTRMKpehTLnN&t=400\n\nmaybe some aggressive performance mode is being used or the windows performance mode is conflicting with the hp software's performance modes",
  "what did you buy to replace it? I'm looking into the Omnibook flip right now. Looking for a 2-in-1 device like this or the asus px13. Every windows laptop seems to have some sort of issue though.",
  "Oh well I see. Thank you for the answer. As always HW without proper SW to backed it up is a bit of a waste. I hope Intel will move fast of the driver issues. \n\nTo bad that most of my apps are too dependent on X86... I hope I'll not regret selling my gaming laptop for a tablet & desktop for now.",
  "Update: I received my new replacement OmniBook Ultra Flip and this device does not have the Bluetooth problem that the previous laptop had, whew. It is working great with Windows 1124H2 and I agree with all the positives you listed in your review! Thank you for your detailed review.",
  "Thank you so much, I will report back with an update in a week or so.",
  "thanks for the review.\n\nI received mine yesterday and it is an amazing laptop, built very nicely. I must say I am a bit afraid of breaking it lol, I never had such a light and thin laptop before (my old one is a Lenovo Ideapad 320 from 2016 if I am not mistaken).\n\nI have a few questions for you:\n\n\\- How was the reinstallation process? I see that you downloaded some drivers from HP website and the others you used Windows Update. Did you have any issues other than the trackpad and WiFi not working out of the box? It is a pity this laptop comes with so much bloatware...\n\n\\- How's the battery so far for your usage? I haven't tested it yet, I want to first reinstall everything.\n\nThanks",
  "It's good. Wouldn't say it blows me away in any particular category. Running Need for Speed Underground 2 right now on PS2 at 5x native. Anything more than that it struggles.\n\n8.1/10",
  "Thank you for your response. I don't know, sometimes I think this laptop would be better with a Snapdragon chip. I really need my laptop as quiet as possible. It seems nothing can beat Apple at this segment, at least at the moment.",
  "I would add that apple consistently has software issues with new tech, the iphone 16 for example has had issues with touch just not working until restarted and the MacBooks having similar freeze issues which you have minimal control over until apple releases an update. I think Microsoft/Intel/hp will figure it out sooner rather than later.",
  "Thank you for your response. What is your alternative notebook to order? \nI don't think the zenbook s14 for example is without any flaws.\nI should get mine sometime in mid-November. That means there will be some time for potential software issues to be fixed :D",
  "After a lot of research, I think the Omnibook is the way to go soley for the price aspect. for 1700 dollars(current price of book5) u get wayy better stats with the omni(32 gigs, 1TB, and an core 9 ultra 288V) which is really nice. HP is overall more reliable in the laptop market and I have seen overall positive reviews on it, its great for office/general tasks and videos, okay at gaming, and amazing in looks and quality. hope this helps",
  "It's hard to go back after using a haptic track pad. And the Omnibook is $400 off this week.",
  "I returned a week later. While it replaced the Spectre, it definitely cut a few corners from a quality standpoint. The keyboard and track pad both were a step back and general performance was shaky. Using Google docs and having about 10 tabs open for research would cause it to chug. I would be typing and it would take several seconds for it to appear on screen \n I ended up with the S16 which has been pretty after a few updates stabilized it",
  "So am a computer science student (will be going into second year) but other than the normal school and cs usage , lots of media consumption, browsing web etc , I don’t plan to game at all on this but plan to use it a lot in general ?",
  "I was talking about the Omni book ultra flip, the new spectre in a sense , with the 3k oled screen etc, basically same as spectre except it runs lunar lake so much better battery life, lower multi core tho, but I think as a cs student I should be okay?",
  "Are you running into similar issues as u/planedrop had? Unstable BT, and others ?",
  "Thanks. There are a handful of specific applications I need that only work on Windows but then there is Parallels",
  "I thought about it, but after seeing both in person, I would say there is a big difference in build quality. The screen is also much nicer on the flip. I could see the non-flip make sense if gaming was important to you.",
  "When talking about drivers are you talking about the AMD non flip one? Cuz that isn't relevant if so. \n\nGlad that one is better though.",
  "Agreed!",
  "Oh, why did you return it?\n\nIn your original post you said that you would keep it.",
  "I registered my index finger again as “another finger” and it seemed to work a little better, so maybe I’ll add it a few more times as I don’t think there’s any type of penalty.\n\nAs far as gaming goes, I was hoping for a little better performance, but it’s probably not as bad as I think it is.  I was initially hoping you could leave it at 1880 and do 50% render resolution and let up scaling make it look better, but I think the reality is you have to drop the resolution to 940p or whatever to get playable frame rates.",
  "IDK. I haven't kept Ubuntu, I reinstalled windows 11 for now.\n\n\nI'd say probably. I plan on trying again next year with a more recent kernel and Ubuntu (or other distro)",
  "Yes the motherboard supports Gen 4 and Gen 5 SSD as both are an option as a custom build on HP website.",
  "You know, now that I think about and read the original post again.... I might have the same Bluetooth issues. My use case is primarily for Livestream & editing for my eSIM Studios YouTube Channel. Let me test some stuff and keep a close eye on it over the next few days and I'll get back to you in regards to this issue via this thread. Got a new S25 Ultra and Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro and was having connection issues with those buds, even with the Galaxy Buds Windows app installed. I'm sure a simple USB type c Bluetooth adapter would solve the issues but that's besides the point. We are just talking about the laptop as is.",
  "Actually I already use Win Pro on another machine mainly for bitlocker, assigned access and remote desktop. I'd like to get the same features on my next laptop. That's why I ask if this model correctly support an upgrade.",
  "Thanks for getting back to me! The notification pops up in Windows. I think I figured out what's going on. My old chargers and the other one I use are 65W, but this new one only puts out 3.25 amps. My laptop needs 4.33 amps, so I'm guessing that's why I'm getting the message. I'm going to try a charger with higher amps and see if that fixes it. Thanks for your help!",
  "Thanks for your reply and advice. Do you have the exact model number of your 16” device.",
  "Thank you for the knowledge! I'll shut down at night. Number 1 got fixed by uninstalling the touchpad driver. Now the touchpad works brilliantly! Go figure...",
  "What laptop did you switch to instead? Any recommendations?",
  "I just ordered a new one and it arrived with two weeks of warranty so I'm returning it to Amazon. I bought a different better one directly from HP, hoping to have better results. When I fired up the one I'm returning for the first time I was shocked at how much shit is on it LOL I'm tempted to install Linux to be honest LOL",
  "Thank you!",
  "I personally would yes, at least until Intel or whoever works out the issues the Omnibook had.",
  "Thanks! Yeah I hope so as well. \n\n  \nSo far Bluetooth has been fine, I tested joining a meeting and leaving a few times while playing music (which swaps the type of BT connection) and so far they sound good, no echo, no disconnects, and they reconnect right after a reboot. \n\n  \nSo I'm hopeful on that. \n\n  \nI did just post another comment that the Thunderbolt issues still exist, but that's kinda par for the course with TB docks, I manage a lot at work and they all are a bit quirky. If the other issues are fixed I may just buy a new TB cable or dock and see how things behave.",
  "Yeah HP's website doesn't have it properly listed on the support site via search yet, so I had to find it by using the HP software on the machine. \n\n  \nLuckily, I have the link: [https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-omnibook-ultra-flip-14-inch-2-in-1-laptop-next-gen-ai-pc-14-fh0000/model/2102254417?sku=A9SR3UA&serialnumber=5CD436CW48](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-omnibook-ultra-flip-14-inch-2-in-1-laptop-next-gen-ai-pc-14-fh0000/model/2102254417?sku=A9SR3UA&serialnumber=5CD436CW48)\n\n  \nThat goes direct to the drivers section.",
  "Oh, you bought it? So how is it? Like it? Please let me know. I'm on the fence between a ThinkPad X1 Yoga 2-in-1 (Gen 9) and this HP Omnibook.\n\nu/planedrop Any thoughts? Appreciate it. My main interests/works are:\n\n1. 2.8K (or more) touch display. I cannot live without the touch. It's incredibly convenient and makes me 100X productive.   \n2. Microsoft Office & Power BI  \n3. Webcam for corp meetings",
  "It could be regional or could be related to the retailer maybe, I got mine from BestBuy. I didn't need it though so didn't really pay attention to whether or not it came with it.\n\n  \nAnd yeah I think other ones will work just fine, but probably won't magnetize to the side as well/at all, so I'd go with the HP one personally.",
  "I didn't get the pen with mine, so I am not sure I can be much help here, sorry! \n\n  \nI think it's supposed to work with all MPP 2.0 pens pretty easily, maybe the pen is defective or something?",
  "I am not 100% sure to be honest, it felt very sturdy, but I didn't do a materials inspection on it.",
  "Got it. You might hop on it soon the Spectre X360 has been discontinued as far as I know, so most retailers are clearing it out.",
  "Fixed my post, was in the middle of a conversation with another person and left out the flip.",
  "On my device, none so far, after a week of owning it.",
  "Thanks. Do you fresh install with Windows 11 23H2 or 24H2?",
  "Most of the same problems were there, which is another reason I don't blame HP for the issues. I think Intel's Lunar Lake drivers are just really bad right now, which would explain both the BT and the Thunderbolt issues I was having. \n\n  \nI also had it crash in sleep once but that was probably Windows (every laptop I've owned in recent years does this). \n\n  \nThe final issue I had, which I didn't know when I posted this thread, was for some reason having my ethernet adapter plugged into USB C after Windows 11 setup finished was causing BSOD loops, but unplugging that instantly fixed it.",
  "may i know if the trackpad is a hatpic trackpad or a tradition trackpad on your customizable version? ",
  "just got mine today, can confirm screen door effect is there, returning the laptop, keys are also kind of annoying too, not enough travel",
  "Asus Zephyrus G16, really liking it overall but it does have a few hardware related issues and bugs. Still a great machine.",
  "I haven't. Not really doing a lot of gaming. How are you getting that measure?",
  "Ended up getting a Zephyrus G16, so far i'ts been OK, has had some issues but I've managed to fix them all (things like fans spinning during sleep etc)\n\n  \nFunny you say that about Windows Laptops though, cuz I completely agree, I've tried like 10 machines in the last couple years but all of them have had major issues.",
  "OK really glad to hear that! \n\n  \nI've since moved on, but this is great. So maybe mine was legit defective.",
  "Update request! How do you like the Omnibook?",
  "Installation process is pretty normal.\n\nThe WiFi issue isnt unique to this device. Its pretty common that the default drivers in windows setup dont work with every hardware.  \nActually i have to admit i did not try the installation without extra loading the WiFi drivers (i dl them first, extract onto a folder of my USB installation Stick, and then load them manually at the start of windows setup - \"load drivers\" button at the bottom of the partitioning/select partion windows).\n\nBut you can also just use a usb-LAN dongle, or even use your Phone with USB tethering. Or install without internet connection or windows account. Just google for one of the explanations.\n\n  \nThe touchpad on a notebook not working during windows setup i did not encounter for some time. But you can just use the keyboard to navgate through, or plug in a mouse. \n\n  \nAfter windows setup finished everything worked as far i could tell. I just installed the mentioned ones manually right away because these are the ones which often are prone to make problems in my experience.\n\nI actually noticed that, at least 2 days ago, the Graphics driver for the Intel ARC 140V iGPU from HP lagged a bit behind the one directly offered from Intel.\n\n  \nI have not used it long or often enough nor did i do a real objective battery runtime test to really give a good quantitative answer on the battery.   \nBut from all i ve seen i would call it a good runtime. I m probably at the ballpark of 8-10 hours active mixed use time down to 10-15% or so. Perfectly fine. And a bit better than my Yoga 2in1 with the Ryzen 6800U, which had a larger 71Wh battery, i would say.\n\nBut that really always strongly depends on what exactly you do, brightness, etc ...",
  "thanks for responding! :)\n\ncan i ask if the fans and battery life are still good since you’ve had it for a bit now? i wanna get this for college and wanna make sure it’ll be ok lel",
  "Yeah I mean I would agree but Windows on ARM still isn't that good, there is still so much that just doesn't work right. I'm excited about that as the future, but at the same time I don't really see x86 going away, it's got a lot of useful extensions.",
  "Yeah this is true, it does happen, I was just hoping to get lucky I guess lol. \n\n  \nI could reach out to HP and see if they have any ideas.",
  "I'm not sure at this point, I'm back on my XPS 15 9520 right now, but it has some serious issues. I just feel all the big laptop brands are kind of a shit show at this point, so I may end up going to something like a Sager laptop (they're an SI that builds in Clevo chassis'), they've always been rock solid stable for me. I currently have one but it's just too massive to carry around all the time, if I were to go for their 16 inch model I think it would be more reasonable.",
  "Thank you for your answer, I think so too but for me I got another \"issue\" as well. I have all the products from samsung, buds, tab, phone and the convenience between Notes app, connection to buds cross device is seemless and basically ecosystem is much better on the Book5. Also the screen is anti reflective and brighter, as well as bigger on the book5 which makes me lean more towards it. Still unsure between these 2 but I 100% agree on the HP being the better overall laptop.",
  "Is it. Just this week? You know when the sale ends? Got he specter so trying to decide if I should pull trigger in this and return the x360?",
  "Why can't Europe get these deals 😭",
  "Okay. I that pretty much confirms all the issues I thought there were. Now I’m just waiting for a sale on the zenbook s 14. Did you just go for the 16 because of size or was it the CPU or…?",
  "hi there, I am on the fence from  buying the hp spectre 14 (2024) with i7 155H and going for the omnibook flip ultra 9 288v, since I do a lot of excel with I really want to have a laptop that dont struggle to load and fire up all the tabs quickly hp spectre has great multi core performance since its an H series but the new flip is not only good thing is the npu capacity which has the bare minimum to run co pilot and local ai features what would you recommend I have yet to see hp announce an H series x360 laptop yet",
  "Im looking at the same thing but for architecture, revit, cad etc. I liked what i saw in reviews regarding the integrated graphics with these new chips. I'd imagine it would work plenty fine for cs.",
  "Im looking at the same thing but for architecture, revit, cad etc. I liked what i saw in reviews regarding the integrated graphics with these new chips. I'd imagine it would work plenty fine for cs.",
  "Hey there, I got mine today and so far setting it up has been seamless with no issues at all. Seems like everything has been fixed!",
  "Yeah I wish I was in the same boat, plenty of the things I do really need local windows, I don't trust them to run in parallels. \n\n  \nI'm a sysadmin (among other things) and have to work with really odd/niche legacy software at times.",
  "Personally, I was asking about the drivers of the flip variant you reviewed.",
  "If you look a bit in the comment section you will see that u/planedrop  returned it quite a while ago.\n\n  \nMain issue that I noted down was mostly due to the software and firmware:\n\n\\- Not a stable thunderboult connection with many docks\n\n\\- Not stable bluetooth connection as well.",
  "That's usually the way to go, I do that with some phones too, often times helps with the speed and accuracy. \n\n  \nAnd yeah dropping the resolution is usually the better bet, I've had the resolution scaling setups in a lot of games be worse than running at a slightly higher native resolution (so 100% scaling).",
  "Oh yeah you can definitely upgrade to it. IIRC though RDP is available in Home as well, can't remember for sure. \n\n  \nAlso, Home supports bitlocker, it's just hidden and not the same layout, if you search for encrypted in Windows Search it'll usually come up. It still uses Bitlocker underneath I believe. \n\n  \nBut yeah I ran Pro on this laptop for a bit, no problems.",
  "Yeah the good news is that it'll still charge even on the lower power output. \n\n  \nMost laptops now will warn you in the OS if a charger isn't fast enough, but doesn't mean that it won't charge at all, just not as fast as it ideally could.",
  "There may have been conflicting drivers installed or something and uninstalling those had Windows re-install the ones from Windows Update. Glad it's working though!",
  "I'm thinking of buying this laptop for in-laws. Would you recommend it? It's on sale now at Best Buy.  \n\nFrankly, I  they only need this to pay bills, surf the web, YouTube, etc.",
  "I have the Zephryus G16 and I really like it, but it's not really the same class of machine either. It's good, but it has some serious sleep problems so I just shut it down everytime I am done with it. And it has a few other minor issues, like once in a while (like 3 times in the near year I've had it) the second M.2 will just disconnect from the system, so far that's only been on boot though, never during usage.",
  "What do you mean 2 weeks of warranty though? Was it not brand new? If it's brand new the warranty period starts when the device arrives at your location. \n\n  \nBut yeah for sure I get you on the bloat, there is a lot and it's super annoying. I've seen worse than HP though, Dell is even more of a problem and their software packages often times cause more issues. And then don't even get me started with Razer lmao.",
  "They weren’t able to cancel my order",
  "Ok if I can cancel I will if not I’ll try the omnibook when delivered to see if I like it",
  "Are there any other laptops you would recommend I have a max budget of $1300",
  "Thanks for the continued updates !! , one quick question does it come in black colour ? Because I was look for the non flip and they have only grey colour. Thanks.",
  "HP is not the best about updating drivers from my experience and I've as much as told them so at HP headquarters directly. It's this that makes me hesitate to buy from them but I hope this will one day improve since they are among the better PC builds on the market these days.",
  "I really like it. I've used X1s previously as work laptops and they're just so.... Lenovo black plastic.  They're like a beige PC tower from 2001.\n\nThis HP has a much more modern design that I enjoy using.\n\nPerformance is great, battery life is excellent. I'm not pushing it hard though, and my previous personal device was an XPS 17 so any decent battery life will feel amazing to me!",
  "I got too the omnibook:  \n\\+touch works great\n\n\\+ amazing pen into the box\n\n\\+ screen very very nice and clear i do not use glasses anymore because fonts are sharper and more contrast  \n\\-  battery life not that great but not the worse i get about 5h real world usage (i'm a coder) so browsing+vscode   \n\\+ amazing built feels very sturdy",
  "Thanks!!",
  "Im really between this and book5 pro 360 as I have the buds, watch, tab and phone. I'm a med student so note taking is important and the convenience between 😅 I dont know if youve looked up the book5 but do you know what way this would be better than that?",
  "Glad to read that you don't have issues. I'm seriously considering to buy this model which will hit my local market in Nov.",
  "23H2. I do plan on keeping it assuming I can get past these issues. For a Windows laptop, I love the hardware. Trackpad, screen and keyboard are excellent. I miss Mac but have to keep using Windows due to work.",
  "I received my omnibook flip today and I had ordered the customisable one with 258v 32GB ram version and I can confirm that the touchpad is indeed haptic. Setting it up was pretty seamless, no issues at all with anything! Absolutely loving it so far!",
  "Sad ): . What about the rest of the laptop? Performance and battery life? Btw, Just Josh said in the same video the only OLED touchscreen he's seen without that effect was the Snapdragon elite Lenovo Yoga 7 slim. Hopefully, they'll port it over to their intel models soon.",
  "Yeah it sucks. I'm looking at getting a cheaper thin and light now instead and everything I research has some kind of random problem. Macbooks seem great but the pricing is a turn off.",
  "I love it! I have a small problem with it dropping my Bluetooth Logitech mouse after an overnight rest, but I love the size and the springy keyboard and how fast it is. Planedrop, who I originally responded to, wrote a great extensive review. I am not a gamer, so I can’t respond to how it would work for gaming, but I do find it to be a very responsive laptop. Picture quality is excellent too.",
  "Thanks for sharing! It's been a long time I don't install Windows on a very new hardware, just wanted to know what to expect.\n\nI will download drivers before doing it, hopefully it will go smooth :)\n\nHave a good rest of week!",
  "Battery life has been pretty good actually. The fans aren't really noticeable. For college work you should be golden. It's versatile and practical. Have fun at school, make good decisions!",
  "It seems like only one or a few laptop companies have figured it out: focus on two different models, two different sizes, and that's it. And make those perfect. With all other manufacturers, the portfolio feels like a jungle. How many different models do Lenovo, Asus, and HP offer at the same time? It's almost inevitable that, as a customer, you end up with compromises.",
  "Yeah so if you have a full ecosystem the Note might be a better idea as it fits  in better and is a lot more convenient. At the end of the day they are both great laptops with some downsides to each, but you really cannot go wrong especially now that you have an ecosystem.",
  "I am shopping at Best buy and the sale for the Omnibook Flip will end this coming Sunday, unless it's an HP sale which they are price matching and it may stay on sale.",
  "If you have the 2024 Spectre X360 it will have better speakers and better multi-core performance, so depending on your work/usage it may still be a better option.\n\nFor my usage I am strictly using it for Google docs, research and basic media consumption, so the Ultra Flip fits for me.",
  "Size and the HX365 has 24gb of ram",
  "Cool cool preciate it, most likely will pull the trigger, one of the main things is I need Haptic Touch coming from a Mac Pro , and the 2 in 1 is not needed but with how much media consumption I do, it is super nice to watch shows and movies on , YouTube etc\n\nBasically between this and the zenbook but that does not have a haptic and trying to keep price 1500 max , lower better",
  "Ah gotcha, yeah I'm glad I returned it, not sure if the issues have been fixed but it was a big issue. \n\n  \nI'm now on a Zephyrus G16 and so far no issues but it's only 1 day in.",
  "Well...lets hope that its fixed by now.  \nImpulse purchased it today due to a pricing error on HPs website.\n\nDown to 1399€ from 1999€ including taxes.\n\n258V version with 2TB, pen and adapter.",
  "I can't seem to find a way to turn Hyper-V off.  I'm running android emulators, and they hate it.  I've tried running the command prompt/powershell commands as well as looked for it in Windows Features but it didn't show up.  I think it's tied to memory integrity/core isolation but I can't access it for some reason.  Not sure if I should install Windows 11 Pro instead?  Any ideas?",
  "Thanks for your feedback. I was a little scary that bloatwares and other HP-homemade would crash Pro. I'm reassured.",
  "I was also looking at that! I like 16\" for the larger view and the G16 seems like a really premium/well-built laptop. I don't really game, but having a machine with more power couldn't hurt I guess.",
  "Yeah so I did a little Google search and apparently HP starts your warranty when the computer is built, not when you get it. So the only way to get that fixed is to submit a dispute. I decided to return it because submitting the dispute on their website was a nightmare.",
  "I have the omnibook. I did a full wipe and reinstall of windows. Updated all my drivers and have had zero issues.\n\nI didn't have issues before either. My HP Omnibook USB settings by default had it set to disable power to USB while asleep. So be sure to disable that in windows if you want your peripherals to stay powered on while sleeping. My Bluetooth have been solid. One issue with staying connected to my office printer. I think it's my printer because it stays connected to our drafting printers with no issues. \n\nAll our software is x86 and windows so Apple isn't an option for me",
  "If you can find the newer G14 from Asus for around that, it's a great deal, have to be sure it's the new one that is all metal though. I have the G16 and while it's had it's fair share of issues, most of them I was able to resolve without too much trouble (just driver reinstalls). \n\n  \nThe only remaining one is sometimes the fans don't turn off when I close it to put it in sleep mode, it's a known issue but doesn't appear to be a fix for it, so I just power it off whenever I am done with it for the day instead of sleeping it.",
  "And they also deleted the drivers from that link...",
  "In my opinion, this HP is a better product. But if you have all Samsung devices, Book5 Pro will certainly be easier to integrate. Unfortnately it has only 16GB RAM option which might not be enough.",
  "From my experience with Asus Zenbook S16 (AMD HX370), the camera needs 24H2 to work. I think most new cameras also needing 24H2. Right now 24H2 is quite stable on my laptop except 1 very important thing: it can't wake up sometimes after sleep. So I'm thinking of switch to Lunar Lake. Right now this HP model is the only one I want to buy.",
  "Daggummit lol, wish they would transfer that technology, i was looking at the aura 7i but 15.3\" screen is a little bigger than i wanted, 14\" is just so nice in size. The rest of the laptop is good. Honestly if it wasnt for the screen as i have super sensitive eyes (and the effect is not noticeable whatsoever on anything except a white screen, i stare at a lot of white screens lol), i would 100% keep the laptop. As a side note, my brother and mom dont notice the screendoor effect/doesnt bother them in the slightest. It's super snappy performance wise, battery is solid, great weight, solid build, case smudges with fingerprints easily but thats whatever, trackpad is crisp/easy to use (i dont use them though, mouse guy)",
  "Been hesitating between the Omnibook ultra flip 14 and the Yoga 9i 2 in 1 and what I read about screendoor effect is pushing me to choose the Yoga 9i even though I'll cost me a good chunk more (They said in their review they couldn'h see any screendoor effect).",
  "I feel that, IMO the Macbooks stability may be worth the price though. My Macbook Air has been rock solid for a long time now.",
  "Great to hear! Thanks for sharing 😊",
  "thank you so much!! :]",
  "Yeah this is a good point actually, it gets really messy when they have so many to support, all with their own individual little issues.",
  "So am a computer science student (will be going into second year) but other than the normal school and cs usage , lots of media consumption, browsing web etc , I don’t plan to game at all on this but plan to use it a lot in general ?",
  "Oh okay. I’d be getting the 32gb version of the 14 anyway, but 24 may be enough. Has the 24 been good? I’ve heard there can be trouble with 24 where it reverts to 8+8 sometimes. Also, how’s the battery been? I’d be mostly doing google docs and stuff but occasionally more, which seems like your use case a bit. I ask because the intel is supposedly way better on that front. \n\nAnd sorry if these questions are bothering you, please feel free just to ignore me.",
  "Ah, yeah i exclusively use a tiny bluetooth mouse. For me its the lenovo 7i aura vs this. i watched a video where a guy was really impressed with the lenovo 7i aura's chip for large video editing productivity, and its the same chip as the ultra flips. Im leaning towards the flip for a 14\" screen.",
  "Good luck, hope it works out for you. I just was getting close to the end of my return window and didn't want to risk it not getting fixed with updates.",
  "Hyper-V isn't available on Home edition, so you can't turn it on or off which is why it's not showing up in the features section. \n\n  \nI'm not super familiar with Android emulators, what are they complaining about? \n\n  \nHyper-V isn't directly available on Home, but some of the other features enable it in the background, such as Windows Subsystem for Linux. You just can't access Hyper-V manager.",
  "Yeah I mean if you ever plan to do something that could use the GPU, like video editing, or something along those lines, it would also be useful for that. \n\n  \nBattery life is pretty good on it too as long as the main GPU isn't in use, display is awesome (non-touch though, FYI, I prefer that though), etc... Really happy with it overall.",
  "Yeah I mean their official guidance is that it's the day it's checked out/purchased, but knowing HP I'm not surprised that they fuck this up lol",
  "wrong...warranty from hp starts the day it was delivered.",
  "[deleted]",
  "I have no laptop as of now nor have I seen any videos, but if rhe samsung apps got downloaded on HP, would it not be pretty much the same computer?",
  "Wanted to follow up and say thank you. I upgraded to 24H2 (manual in-place upgrade). For anyone else that gets this computer or similar, upgrading to 24H2 solved the last few issues such as camera detection and USB Peripherals. Until I did that, USB dongles, docking station, etc were not recognized. Thanks again u/bob418",
  "Oh great. Thank you. I will try that.",
  "Watch out for future samsung laptops. I'm almost sure they don't have it either. I mean, it's samsung after all. Their screens are the absolute best in the market.",
  "Yeah I've had both macs and PCs in the past and macs generally just work without issues. Windows you have to be willing to get stuck in and troubleshoot. \n\nI was looking for a powerful laptop under \\~$1300 that I could dock for my home office setup and also use as a laptop when I need something portable. That's why I was interested in the Flip, PX13, etc.\n\nBut instead I pulled the trigger on the M4 Mac Mini for $500 at costco. It seems to be a steal of a deal and should work great for my home office. 16GB is fine on a mac for what I need especially at that price, and I can add an external hard drive later to add on to the 256GB it comes with.\n\n  \nThat leaves me with \\~$800 from my budget to get a thin and light laptop to pair with it. Getting 2 devices instead of 1 this way since the mac mini was such a good price. \n\nAround that price range, I can get a M2 or M3 Macbook Air with 16GB/256GB. Would go nicely with the mac mini... but the storage is a bummer and you can't upgrade it on macs. \n\nI could also get a snapdragon or lunar lake laptop as those have good battery performance, but I'd be limited to 16GB and have to deal with the windows laptop QC lottery. There are some good deals right now, Lunar Lake vivobook for $650, snapdragon vivobook for $550, surface laptop for $800. Considering all of those but I would really like 32GB RAM if a deal comes around.\n\nThere's also deals for older intel/amd chips but I don't trust their battery life. Maybe I would consider intel meteor lake if it was a killer deal.\n\nLaptop buying is in a weird place right now, there's lots of options, but no clear winner and you have to compromise on something unless you'll pay a lot more.",
  "Is there a screendoor effect on the screen? How bad is it? Also, how's the screen's reflectivity.",
  "I use it for pretty light task (web research, writing and music), so I've been getting 12+ hours with backlight at about 65%, so pretty good. I know it doesn't touch Macbook and some of the Snapdragon laptops, but I don't have to worry about compatibility.",
  "I will definitely give that a look, what screen size is it?",
  "Thanks :)",
  "Well its a shit device.\n\nAwful wifi, awful bluetooth, awful speaker awful display, awfdul keyboard and awful software.",
  "Hyper-V worsens the performance apparently. I’ve tried a few and they all complain.  I will most likely install Win Pro and give it a shot.  Maybe I should wait to decide if I’m keeping the laptop otherwise.  Not sure if there’s a restore partition.",
  "Absolutely, how else do you run a successful business?",
  "Nope. Had to contact them and they reset it to the day it was delivered.",
  "Its a turn off for me.  \nAll other manufacturers have their entire driver list online with documentation etc.  \nHP cant even do that. \n\nI kinda want the HP, but there is also the Asus S14.",
  "It would work partially. My previous experience of using Galaxy watch with Pixel phone was like that.",
  "Great it works for you. I'm keeping my eyes on this model. It'll come to my local market in November.",
  "I can confirm - I had a Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 (and the Book4 Pro 360 before it), and neither had any screendoor effect at all. The screens were fantastic, the reason I sold both was due to the awful trackpads (non-haptic, but palm/finger rejection was atrocious on both). Also the build was a bit flimsy compared to others - and those screens are very fragile (they are known to crack seemingly randomly). \n\nI currently have a Snapdragon Surface Pro 11, which is a great machine, but the OLED screen on that is so glarey it hurts my eyes, and having too many issues with emulated apps running too slowly and eventually just grinding to a halt, that I'm seriously considering the HP in this thread!",
  "For sure, and honestly I actually kinda like troubleshooting, I just wish my main devices that I used as tools *to* troubleshoot didn't have so many issues lol. I think I will still be sticking with Windows regardless though. \n\n  \nGood choice on the Mac Mini, it's a great machine and a pretty amazing price TBH. \n\n  \nAs for the laptop, I would personally still say avoid Lunar Lake, with how many issues I had, mostly related to what appear to be bad drivers from Intel, I'd just say nah. Go with a Ryzen AI 300 series or something instead, they're close to as efficient and more stable in my (and others) testing. \n\n  \nSnapdragon machines also work of course, but if you run across something that's not native ARM, it's pretty rough, even with their decent emulation layer (it's def not as good as Rosetta though). \n\n  \nThe Macbook Air might be the way to go TBH, depends how much you want Windows though. Storage is fine IMO unless you are doing more intensive things, which then you should be looking at something like a Macbook Pro anyway IMO. 8GB of RAM on MacOS is even pretty usable, it's more efficient on that front, so 16GB with the new models should be fine (I have an Air w/ 8GB, mostly just a web browsing machine but it never got sluggish for me even with like 30 tabs open). \n\n>  \nLaptop buying is in a weird place right now, there's lots of options, but no clear winner and you have to compromise on something unless you'll pay a lot more.\n\n  \nCouldn't agree more, and even when you pay a lot more, there are still downsides/issues. I had a Razer Blade 16, top spec w/ the 4090, that I had to return due to hardware problems (I've had 4 Razer laptops, 1 didn't have hardware issues, pretty bad QC). \n\n  \nSo far the Zephyrus G16 is pretty solid, we will see how it goes long term. I initially had issues with it not turning the fans off during sleep, stuttering in GPU accelerated applications, and some other stuff. But so far that all seems fixed after re-installing more drivers and also completely removing Armoury Crate (which means I can't change power settings to Turbo, but I find Windows native High Performance to be plenty for it, and the RGB controls of the keyboard work natively with Win11's RGB controller).",
  "Okay. 12+ hours is all I needed. Now it’s all about price. Thanks.",
  "15.3\" I think, its quite a bit bigger but similar weight",
  "I felt like the keyboard and display were both great (display is objectively fantastic, it's an OLED afterall). \n\n  \nBut sorry to hear they haven't resolved these issues, really lame.",
  "Long story short, I'm going to be returning this laptop.  It's physically a wonderful laptop.  I just want a little more power out of it, even gaming at 800p, it didn't seem quite playable in games like Warzone, Delta Force and Marvel Rivals.  Obviously, they're somewhat demanding titles.  I ended up buying an Asus Vivobook with the HX370 and 32GB of ram for $900 open box.  The other issue I had was with the lack of USB-A ports.  The machine is really sleek but only has 3 USB-C ports, one of which is of course usually going to be used for charging.  Since the BT always had to be turned off and on, I would just elect to use a Logitech mouse I had already with a relatively low profile receiver.  However, very few mice have USB-C receivers.  I'd probably have to buy one from Keychron, and the receiver wouldn't be small enough for me to have 100% confidence in leaving it in, so that would be two ports down and always having to make sure I had a USB-A to C adapter.  Not having to buy a $50 mouse helps cover the difference between the two laptops and I can use the mouse I already have, know and love.  The finger print reader was too unreliable for me even with multiple registrations of the same finger.  The other laptop will just use the camera.  Also, I'm trying to get into data analysis, and the Asus has a numpad.",
  "[deleted]",
  "Hmm, makes it hard. What would you go for, better laptop or ecosystem?",
  "Sometimes troubleshooting can be fun for my ADHD but overall I just want stuff that works.\n\nShame to hear about your experiences with lunar lake, it looks very promising on paper. Great battery life, good single core performance, and arguably the best current integrated graphics. Taking a hit on the multi-core is a worthy tradeoff for me when it comes to a laptop.\n\nThe Ryzen AI 300 series also had good benchmarks. It seems to favor performance over battery life, heat, and fan noise though, at least compared to Lunar Lake. There's also not as many models with that chip to choose from. I was going to buy the PX13 with that chip but that's when I wanted a more powerful laptop. It might still work for my new criteria but it just depends on what deals I can find.\n\n  \nSnapdragon is a weird one. On paper it has what I'm looking for, but many people have had various issues with it, and the emulation means you'll take a hit to performance for certain apps. Enough of those will add up and bog down your overall speed. Mostly just considering snapdragon because the prices for them are dropping like a rock, there are some very decent deals available.\n\nReading your last paragraph makes me a bit sad, you had to do all that just to get your new expensive laptop to function as it should. And the bar is so low that you're still praising it over previous purchases! I don't like apple's business practices but they are crushing windows when it comes to user experience right now. Vertical integration means their stuff just works smoothly (generally).\n\nFML I might be talking myself into a macbook. Cmon windows give me a killer deal!",
  "I actually hate it when I cant use part of the trackpad.  \nThats a good hint.\n\nWas it easy to get rid of the HP bloatware?  \nAlso, here is the most important question (dont worry, it will be my last one): Can you set the display to 60hz?  \nI have seen one video where the only two choices were 120 or 48.",
  "Haha, I don't have definite answer. But I won't buy this Galaxy Book5 Pro even though it has better display.\n\n- I don't like the keyboard (very shallow, poor touch feel and useless numpad for me)\n- I don't like the trackpad (out of center and not haptic)\n- I don't want to buy a 16GB machine from now.",
  "Agreed, Lunar Lake is sad. And I think it's just not being caught by reviewers cuz almost none actually try to daily drive laptops they review in any real world workloads. Dock stability is one example, almost never covered and I've had SO MANY dock issues with Thunderbolt supported laptops. \n\n  \nI have a Zephyrus G16 with the HX 370 in it and it's been great, it actually runs really quiet in balanced mode on battery, fans turn on sometimes but not much, and even while docked I basically can't hear it. I think the heat issues are overblown honestly, but this is a bit of a larger machine so might be different with the super thin devices. \n\n  \nSnapdragon could be worth a shot though, I'd say maybe do it from BestBuy or some other place that makes returns easy, and then try it for a week or two and see if you run into problems. \n\n  \nAnd completely concur about Windows, Microsoft (and OEMs to some degree) need to do better. It'll take a long time for Microsoft to realize their market-share is declining, and when that happens it might be too late to turn it around, most people that go Mac don't ever go back.",
  "any reviews for dell inspiron 14 plus 2022? I found this model on a locak retail store and liked the specs but I haven't found any reviews online. Has anyone bought this recently? how is it? What are the colors available for this model?",
  "hopefully this link helps.\n\nhttps://www.9to5gadgets.com/2022/07/review-dell-inspiron-14-plus-7420.html",
  "There are a couple of decent YouTube clips available. I had mine delivered the other day. First impressions, I love it and seems very capable for my needs:\n1. Working with Microsoft office documents\n2. Browsing with loads of tabs. \n3. Video streaming. \n4. Light photo and video editing.",
  "Do you recommend it?",
  "Yep 100% but I also bought an Asus zenbook s13 the other day lol. It's a lot lighter to carry around. I just needed something to chuck in my bag and it's barely noticeable. I keep the dell for more demanding tasks such as video editing and photo touch ups. But the Asus is more than capable too, although it's not future proofed with onboard soldered 16GB RAM.",
  "Alright thank you",
  "Inspiron 16 Plus (7620) or Thinkbook 16p Gen2?  So I already have the 7620 here, but because of a minor coil whine I'm thinking about returning it.\n\nPrice for the Thinkbook and the Inspiron are about the same. Unfortunately 16p Gen3 is not available in Germany yet.\n\nInspiron (ca. 1900€ incl. 3y premium warranty):\nI7 12700h\n32 GB RAM\n3060 60W\n1 TB SSD\n\n16p (ca. 2000€ incl. premium warranty):\n5900HX\n32 GB RAM\n3060\n1 TB SSD \n\nBecause the 12700h is supposed to be much faster then the 5900HX, I initialy went for it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? \nI'm using it for CAD incl. rendering, Lightroom and Photoshop.\n\nAdd. question: Is it worth waiting for the 16p Gen3? I expect it to be a lot more expensive then both models."
