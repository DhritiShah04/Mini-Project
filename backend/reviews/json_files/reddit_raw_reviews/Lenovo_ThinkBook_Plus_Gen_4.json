  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience). I have a Lenovo duet 5 now which I love but the snapdragon is feeling a little long in the tooth when I have more than a few tabs open.\n\nI guess my heart says Lenovo but brain said MacBook Air.",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop. Having good speakers is a great bonus for the Lenovo for me, as well as a bright screen. Don't need maximum power as for heavy workload I want to rely on remote desktops.",
  "Check your local best buys, in my area (SE Michigan) the Lenovo is on BB as a used excellent for $530 which is the right price point. So see if you can find one in your area for that price",
  "Unfortunately not near me but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nWhat do you think the chances of the kompanio lasting close to apple silicon?",
  "Not sure, thats a ChatGPT quesiton lol \n\nHappy hunting, hopefully you can find one soon.   I hear that they are high-end Chromebooks with Spandragon x Elite processors coming; I'm hoping they are here just before the holiday season.",
  "Ended up with the m4 MacBook air. It went on sale on Amazon for 750(!) and I can't find the Lenovo near me. Also mixed in the surface laptop for fun but the air just seems too good. Thanks again for your help!",
  "Acer Chromebook Plus 714 Review - A Monarch in the making (for Chromebooks) I’ve long been a fan of Acer Chromebooks, mainly because they were one of the first companies that really took ChromeOS seriously and pushed out multiple devices at different price points so people could actually try the platform out. My very first Chromebook back in 2015 was an Acer (and I’ve owned four Acer Chromebooks since then). I loved that original device, even with its limitations in RAM and power at the time. But Acer has come a long way, and now I’ve got my hands on the new Acer Chromebook Plus 714. This one comes with a premium build, pure power, and unexpectedly great battery life.\n\nIt's not a “new release”, but it's the best Chrombook Acer makes, so I had to check it out as I'm on my journey to find the best new Chrombook for me. So let’s get into it.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmbbq2mxr6qf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d3134b2a3c13e924ed1043ba200030769b02d06\n\nThe design looks sharp. It has a premium feel with gold edges against the dark grey finish. The body is solid aluminum, and it really feels like a top-tier machine in hand. Inside, it switches to plastic, but not the cheap kind. It feels solid, comfortable under your palms and wrists, and there’s no flex when typing.\n\nPort selection is solid: two USB-C ports, an HDMI port (which should honestly be standard on every laptop), a headphone jack (another must-have), and USB-A ports. The downside is both USB-C ports are on the left side, which already caused me an issue with charging since my setup needed a right-side port. They could have easily put one on each side, and it feels like a miss.\n\nFor a device at this price, it should also have a fingerprint scanner, standard in my book for anything over $500, especially a Chromebook.\n\nOn the positive side, it’s a 360-degree convertible, so you can flip it into tablet or tent mode, which is surprisingly useful in tight spaces (like on a plane). But here’s the kicker: some versions of the 714 come with a built-in stylus, and mine didn’t. That should’ve been standard across all models at this price point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hr13bs3zr6qf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27f67b6daff371c0c5a569f5f774116c3d5c630e\n\n**Overall Design & Build: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nThis is always the question that unites man: how long does the battery last? The Chromebook Plus 714 runs on Intel’s new **Core Ultra 5 115U chip**, so I was curious how that would balance performance with efficiency. My past Chromebooks with i5 chips had horrible battery life.\n\nAt first, this one seemed the same, barely a few hours, and even dying overnight in sleep mode. But then, after a few days, something clicked. It optimized itself, and the battery life became excellent.\n\n**My normal workflow includes:**\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web) meets 4-5 hours a day\n* Google Messages app\n* YouTube Music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Brightness around 70%\n\nWith that, it pushes through the day, no problem. Even now in week 2, I charged it 5 days ago, used it an hour or two daily, and it still has 43% left. Whatever optimization Intel and Acer did here worked, because my older HP Chromebook x360 14c with an i3 chip can’t even come close.\n\n**Battery Life: A**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nThe keyboard is good, but not great. I have massive “bearpaw” hands, so I judge every keyboard against the HP x360’s, which still holds the crown for me. This one is fine, with decent travel and good response, but the keys could be just a bit bigger.\n\nThe trackpad is excellent, glass-like, very responsive, accurate, and the perfect size. It does pick up fingerprints easily, but that’s par for the course.\n\nAgain, no fingerprint reader in 2025 for a device at this price range, big miss\n\n**Keyboard: B- | Trackpad: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\n# Speakers & Sound\n\nThis is where Acer cut corners. The speakers are weak, tiny, and honestly feel like they came out of a first-gen Chromebook. No bass, not loud, and just flat overall. Even my phone speakers (iPhone or Galaxy) blow these out of the water. At this price point, they should have borrowed the better speakers from their Windows laptops.\n\n**Speakers: D**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance - Intel Core Ultra 5 115U\n\nThis is the biggest surprise. The new Intel Core Ultra 5 architecture delivers real performance gains in a way I haven’t seen on a Chromebook before.\n\nUnlike the new Lenovo Chromebook with the hyped-up MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip (which stuttered constantly and almost crashed during 4K editing for me), this one handled everything I threw at it. With 20–30 tabs open, Teams in the browser, Zoom app running, and editing 4K video in **InShot**, it was smooth and lag-free. Exporting video was fast, and transitions, text, and clip movements were as fluid as they are on my Galaxy Tab S9+.   This chip also allows you to download all the apps from the Google Play store, something I also saw on the Lenovo, but to me I get better performance on this one.\n\nEven with only 8GB of RAM, it didn’t break a sweat. But at this price, I still think Acer should’ve put in 16GB for better future-proofing.\n\nNow, **benchmarks (JetStream and Speedometer)** only show mild improvements over my older HP x360 14c with an i3 from 2021, which is shocking. But in real-world usage, this chip feels much more powerful. Combined with the strong battery life, this is easily one of the best Chromebook chips out right now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nu5xd0z0s6qf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efa740e012bf81d7d2347cc7a25a3c92aeac6f6c\n\n**Performance: A+**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nThe screen is solid with a 16:10 aspect ratio, crisp visuals, accurate colors, and good brightness (rated at 340 nits, more than enough for outdoor use). It doesn’t quite pop like the Lenovo Chromebook Plus screen (that one I really felt like I was there watching an HDR video), but it’s plenty good for work and media.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/je6xl7k3s6qf1.jpg?width=2398&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=401798ec54a6fa5aea7f3e61b28bb62e825ec3d6\n\nThe camera, though, is excellent. It feels like using my Logitech webcam on Windows. It’s AI-enhanced, sharp in low light, and balanced in harsh light. Chromebooks used to skimp here, but this one really impressed me, even rivaling smartphone-level quality on calls.\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Acer Chromebook Plus 714 is a great machine and a clear look at where Chromebooks are headed with Intel’s Core Ultra chips. It’s sleek, powerful, has excellent battery life, and handles pretty much anything you throw at it within ChromeOS.\n\nFor most people who live in web apps (Docs, Gmail, YouTube, Office), this is exactly what you need. And honestly, people dropping $2,000 on “email machines” should be looking at ChromeOS more seriously.\n\nBut it’s not perfect. The missing fingerprint scanner, weak speakers, plastic interior, and lack of a stylus on all models really hold it back. At its original MSRP of $800, it was priced against the MacBook Air, and it’s not quite at that level yet. But at $629 (and even cheaper for open-box units at Best Buy), it’s an easy recommendation.\n\nRight now, this feels like royalty in the Chromebook lineup. Not quite the King yet, but very close. If they make the changes I mentioned, along with overall improvements due to tech available at the time, the 714 will easily be crowned King of Chromebooks. \n\n**Overall Grade: A**   \n**Excellent pickup.**",
  "I have one I bought two years ago.  One of the keys got stuck but I kind of unstuck it.  It's been good but when I tried to trade it in on this Lenovo, they told me they'd give me fifteen bucks for it so I kept it.  So now I have two chromebooks.  The Lenovo 14 Mediatek and the Acer 714 Spin",
  "You had the regular spin 714 not the plus, this model just came out in December. .but as I said about the keyboard it's not great, so I can see how it got stuck lol\n\nBest buy has the most offensive trade in numbers in the game lol",

Preferably new with local warranty support.\n\nAny recommendations or feedback would be highly appreciated.\n\n\\------------------\n\n# Back Story\n\nAfter a long while, I have finally decided to upgrade my laptop, but the current market dynamics is too confusing for me right now esp. between currency hit, price differences, open-box deals, and Masked/refurbished options, it has been difficult to decide on a laptop that truly fits my needs. I would really appreciate some input from the community.\n\n# Current Setup\n\nI’m currently using an HP ProBook 450 G5 (8th Gen). It has served me well, but it’s beginning to show its age, especially under heavier workloads.\n\n# Requirements\n\nCore Specifications\n\nCondition: Brand new preferred  \nCPU: Intel i7 (H-series or equivalent or better)  \nRAM: 24 GB (16 GB minimum with expansion slot - no soldered ones)  \nStorage - (Must be SSD + HDD option)\n\n* SSD 512 GB for OS (second slot for future expansion is a plus)\n* HDD SATA 1 TB (2.5” inch)\n\nDisplay: At least IPS with decent color accuracy & brightness  \nGPU: Nvidia RTX Ada series or something slightly stronger for rendering, encoding/decoding performance. I can work with gaming series but no older than 4000 series.  \n  \nPorts and Connectivity\n\n* Multiple USB A/B/C 2.0/3.0 ports for accessories (mouse, external drives, cooling stand)\n* 3.5 mm audio jack\n* VGA/HDMI port for external display\n* RJ45 LAN port\n* Wi-Fi 4/5 GHz support\n\nKeyboard and Build\n\n* Full-size backlit keyboard (numpad preferred)\n* Rigid build with minimal flex or hinge wobble. Weight isnt an issue.\n* Easy to open for cleaning or upgrades\n* Local parts availability for future maintenance\n\n# Usage Pattern\n\n* My workload involves heavy office use with constant multitasking, often running numerous browser tabs alongside background tools for downloading and file-syncing. Current system starts to lag with ram & cpu reaching max capacity before apps start crashing.\n* I do not play games on the laptop as I have a ps5 pro for that - so I dont require top end latest GPU.\n\n# Not Considering\n\n* MacBooks, due to hardware/software compatibility issues with some custom tools I use.\n* Touchscreen, 2-in-1, tablets, flipbooks or hand-held devices\n* Desktops, as I often work from multiple client offices and need portability\n\n# Current Thoughts\n\n* I’ve been considering Lenovo ThinkPad T or P Series, but many models seem to use TFT panels by default. \n* HP Victus models have good specifications but poor reviews regarding build quality, screen wobble, and keyboard flex. \n* I’m also uncertain about Intel versus Ryzen options and would appreciate insights on that. \n* My goal is to move to at least an IPS panel, since my current laptop has a TFT. OLED would be ideal, but likely beyond budget.\n\n# Budget: \n\nAround 300,000 PKR\n\n# Important Points\n\n* Models that offer the best balance of performance, portability, display & build quality\n* I would prefer numpad on keyboard but if laptop model is worth it then I can compromise as a trade off.\n\nI know I might be asking for a lot, but any advice or recommendations would really help. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to share their thoughts.",

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",

  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Need help choosing a laptop for grad school Ok, Reddit, I need help. TLDR: trying to decide between a single expensive computer with 2 screens, or one of 3 laptops with a color E-ink tablet. Links for all included.\n\nI know very little about computers, but I need a laptop for graduate school. It's online, so all of my textbooks are digital. I get wicked eye pain and migraines when using computers and my cellphone screens for too long, so I also need an E-ink tablet or display for reading. I'm currently using my sister's Microsoft Surface with 16gb RAM and 1TB SSD storage, and it works fast enough for me, so I've narrowed my choices down a bit based on that.\n\nI was going to get this one: \n https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkbook/thinkbook-plus/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-4-13-inch-intel/21jj0003us\n\nThis Lenovo ThinkBook Pro Generation 4 with both an OLED and E-ink screens (and I may still end up going that route), but there are a few detractors. 1) the price: even though it's originally almost $4k, $1,400+ is a lot to spend on a single device that only had 16 gb RAM, and that price doesn't include any extended warranty. 2) If it needs servicing, I'm out both my computer AND my textbook reader until it's fixed, and 3) I need a backlit keyboard. \n\n(My partner is gone 10-12 hours every weekday at work and goes to bed rather early, so we don't get a lot of time together. I have started working on papers and research in bed next to him at night and he just falls asleep while I'm working. He can sleep through pretty much ANYTHING - we joke that he had semi-voluntary narcolepsy! - but I don't want to have to keep the light on in order to do my work. So, backlit keyboard.)\n\nThe other choices I've narrowed down are as follows: \n\nhttps://a.co/d/iUbMkvb\nIt's HP, which I've had before and been somewhat unimpressed with (it wasn't a bad computer, it just didn't wow me), but being a major brand name, I figure if it needs servicing, it will be easier to get done. No backlit keyboard, though.\n\nhttps://a.co/d/ec0KPAQ\nThis is a brand I've never heard of, Rumtuk, but I found a couple reviews online that showed it worked well, even a year later. It's one of the only ones I found with a backlit keyboard in my preferred price range (less than $500 before the protection plan). I'm wary of getting an unknown brand, though (I would get the extended warranty, but if it breaks within the manufacturer's warranty, I'm screwed)\n\nhttps://a.co/d/eEHorDt\nThis is another Lenovo with twice the RAM for not much more price. I'm not a big fan of half the storage being on the cloud, and no backlit keyboard.\n\nAny of these 3 will be paired with a color E-ink tablet, which I'm also still trying to decide on. \n\nHelp me, laptop subreddit! You're my only hope! ",
  "The 2020 King of Portable 2 in 1s: LG Gram 2 in 1 14 inch **EDIT 4 5 MONTHS LATER:** [New Lenovo Carbon Yoga leaked on it's way, might be just enough to compete with the Spin 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lenovo/comments/hh0xzf/in_the_blink_of_an_eye_it_seems_the_almost/)\n\nEDIT 3: Found the mystery, it's the [Acer Spin 5 13.5](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Acer-Spin-3-and-Spin-5-are-now-slimmer-and-get-a-much-needed-upgrade-to-Intel-Ice-Lake.449311.0.html) inch which comes with 3:2 aspect ratio, not the LG Gram. It's not as a wide as the 14 Gram/c940, but it's about as equal in dimensions as the Surface Book 2 (taller than 16:9 14 inch laptops). For this reason + the almost exact same specs as the Gram, it would make it as a solid contender for the real king of 2020 2 in 1 portables.\n\nSmall note: Lenovo's c940 14 inch recieved a BIOS update which now gives about full 10 hour battery life(4K version, UHD probably gets a lot more), ALSO NOW coming close for that 2020 crown. At this point, it's all up to your tastes to which really deserves it.\n\nOriginal post:EDIT 2: So it seems that the aspect ratio of 3:2 in the Gram 2 in 1 was misinformation from a video, as it's apparently a 16:9 ratio instead. I'd still say this 2 in 1 is one of the best since it actually provides a bigger battery with a lot less weight than normal 14 inch models\n\nOriginal post:\n\nAfter a few companies have tried to make the perfect portable 2 in 1 convertible, LG actually went and finally pulled it off among it's competition with it's new Gram 2 in 1 14 inch announced at CES 2020.\n\nMain strong points:\n\nBigger and better battery life, which promises the highest battery life up to date for a 14 inch (not sure how much it was exactly, but I think it was about \\~70,000 mWh sized)\n\nOnly 2 in 1 to weight around 2.5 lb with that big of a battery and screen, making it's tablet mode really easy to use with maximum weight portability in mind\n\nGreat port selection up to HDMI and \\*Thunderbolt 3 (need confirmation there tho since previous Gram 2 in 1 did not have it, reviewer at CES said it might have it)\n\nAnd lastly, Intel's 10th gen chip with 11th gen Iris Plus Graphics for light gaming\n\nAs of now, only the Lenovo c940 could compete against this in the 14 inch category, but with relatively poor battery life and 0.5 pounds extra, the Gram seems to take the cake here. Honorable mentions I'd put the HP Spectre 13 inch late 2019 refresh (16:9 aspect ratio on a 13.3 inch screen tho, horrible design imo) and the new Samsung Galaxy Book Flex (which is like the XPS 13 2 in 1 but arguably better with some extra features with a 16:10 aspect ratio on 13.3 inch).\n\nMy only worries for the LG Gram 2 in 1 2020 so far: chassis hopefully is as sturdy as the c940 (or close to it since c940 has an excellent chassis durability), speaker system will probably not be as good obviously (c940 has Dolby Atmos 360 hinge, hopefully LG's sound will be not completely bad) and Thunderbolt 3's inclusion. Other than those worries, seems to be on it's way to being the 2020 king of portable 2 in 1's.\n\nNote: Did not consider any 2 in 1 15 inches and above since all have weights more than 4 lb and big form factor (while I would say the new HP Spectre x360 15 2020 is the best new coming relatively portable 15 inch 2 in 1, but weighing at 4 lb with a big chassis not many bags can fit, it would basically come at 2nd best portable 2 in 1 for 2020, in case you're looking in the 15 category. If gaming is your thing in the 2 in 1 category then this new HP will probably best fit your needs).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Small but important note: also worried the Gram might not have Windows Hello IR facial recognition, as that I believe is fundamental for any 2 in 1 to have while utilizing in tablet or tent mode. Hopefully it comes with IR additionally to it's finger print Windows Hello scanner to get the real title of (at least almost) perfect 2 in 1 ultraportable.",
  "I'm worried that the thermals will disappoint. The older LG grams were all a little too hot for comfort, an obvious compromise with the design.",
  "[deleted]",
  "2020 and you can't charge via USB-C. It's so usefull when you can charge laptop, for example in train via simple powerbank with PD.",
  "Valid point, but I'm lead to believe all 2 in 1's suffer from this. As an owner of a Lenovo Yoga c940 UHD 14' and past owner of a 2017 HP Spectre x360 13', can confirm both units had/have issues with thermals and sometimes fans spun up while even being at idle. Thankfully I discovered undervolting which quickly fixed that issue pretty fast, as fans (which were always an issue on c940's) barely turn on anymore with idle temps of 39-44 degrees. Before it would almost be at 54-60 on idle occasionally with Windows doing background processes, but undervolting did the trick just right.",
  "Oh well rip, I guess you're right. I saw a top CES laptops for 2020 video and it had mentioned a 3:2 for the 2 in 1. Can't find the original but now that I see your video up close yeah, that's definitely 16:9. I ain't mad tho since I decided to stick with my 14 inch c940 with 16:9 too so now I know I'm not missing much haha.\nThanks for clarifying!",
  "Late comment but, figured which was had the 3:2 aspect ratio: turns out it's the [Acer Spin 5 13.5 inch 2020](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Acer-Spin-3-and-Spin-5-are-now-slimmer-and-get-a-much-needed-upgrade-to-Intel-Ice-Lake.449311.0.html). If you're interested in buying a 2 in 1, that one is definitely now in the competition thanks to that ratio. Edited main post comment.",
  "I'm pretty sure that you can? Just cuz a laptop comes with a proprietary power brick doesn't mean you can't use USB-C to charge it. I've seen even 15 inch which has proprietary and can still charge with USB-C.",
  "Depends on the laptop OFC. Most 2 in 1s pack really small single fan dual heatpipe coolers which are totally inadequate for anything hotter than a dual core and low end GPU. I think a few 15 inch 2 in 1s with dual fan coolers can be relatively cool under loads, but yea, most do get too hot",
  "[deleted]",
  "I have the 2019 version and charge via USB-C all the time so I'm sure you can do it.",
  "For the case of 15 inch, most of them do provide at least minimum adecuate cooling since they use actual dedicated GPUs for gaming/graphic design. Only reason why I excluded them from my analysis is due to body weight (4lb is honestly a bit too much for a 2 in 1) and screen size makes chassis far too big to carry around conventionally in backpacks for most people.",
  "Haha wow. Any reason specifically you didn't like all the ones you returned? What feature do you find them missing so much to not upgrade your c920?",
  "Hi u/teamblades44, what kind of USB-C charger do you use for something with such a big battery (I mean, can any USB-C charger charge as fast as the proprietary power brick?)",
  "Why do you think 4 pounds is too much? My 14 inch laptop is 4 pounds and I wouldn't say it's heavy",
  "You can use any 65 or 90 W USB-c charger.  I think it charges a tiny bit slower but even when I'm using it it still is charging it rather than discharging.",
  "I classify 4 pounds to be a bit on the heavy side for 2 main reasons (one mostly personal other a bit more objective)\n\n1. I carry my laptop in an over the shoulder backpack with a bit of cables and charging equipment. I used to always carry with me a 1.3 pound battery in that bag alongside my old Surface Pro 5, which gave it a bit of weight to the bag but manageable. With the 3 pounds from my c940 and 1.3 from the battery, I do feel shoulder pain when getting home most of the time, so I opted for carrying it my main backpack separately.\n2. My c940 14 inch at 3 pounds is juuust the borderline of what I would consider ideal weight for a 2 in 1. Using it in tablet mode is roughly hard due to weight + sharp edges which stab a bit into the hands, tho I do find 3 pounds to be good enough that the laptop can be held with one hand a bit relatively easy. But at 4 pounds, I wouldn't see myself ever using it in tablet mode and one hand usage would be on the bare minimum there. This is where the new Gram stands out with a killer 3:2 aspect ratio perfect for tablet mode plus an ideal 2.5 weight\n\nWhile I get this might be more personal since it's 1 pound difference from the c940, I know people like to carry light when on the go, and a 15 inch laptop for me is a bit too much for super portability too. Mostly this is just personal tastes, but a 3:2 aspect ratio with 14 inch wideness honestly would be more than good of a display for any needs I would say imo. It all comes down to personal tastes.",
  "If you use it in tablet mode, the weight doesn't matter...\n\nLike it could weight 10 pounds but that won't really affect how you use it as a tablet\n\nBut for day to day carry, I could totally understand wanting something lighter",
  "It actually does matter quite a bit haha, try holding the tablet in the air as you would an iPad to read and your arms will get tired pretty darn quick. Most reviewers always mention this for 2 in 1's since weight is what normally restricts tablet mode for most of them, except this here Gram which finally fixed the issue in a lot of senses.",
  "You don't hold it in your hands. You place it flat on a table like a tablet or drafting table",
  "As someone who suffers from constant neck pains from looking down too much while studying, holding the tablet in the air both in desk and in bed is a godsend feature for me. Really the only think I'll miss from my Surface Pro 5 tbh, since that only weighs a mere 1.7 pounds. I know other people in my school do this hence why I decided to mention it.",
  "Dell XPS, HP Spectre x360, or Razer options, ultraportables vs 15 inch models, trying to decide Sorry for the pseudo double-post since I also posted on Suggest-a-Laptop, but in this case I have three laptops that I've researched fairly extensively and want opinions regarding them specifically more so than a person sending me a link of laptops meeting my \"form\" specification.\n\n\\* \\*\\*Total budget and country of purchase:\\*\\*\n\nUSA. Ideally sub-$2k budget, but I could be convinced to spend more for a machine that will last longer, or combined with an eGPU or separate desktop later on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\\*\\*\n\nI don't care about 2 in 1, but my most recent computers have been a Surface Pro and then the late 2016 Razer Blade Stealth with touch. I absolutely cannot get another laptop/hybrid without a touch screen. I use it more than the trackpad. Before that, I used a Thinkpad joystick/nipple, so I've never felt comfortable with trackpads. I currently use my RBS with a mouse/monitor setup, or on my lap with a mix of trackpad and touch screen. Mostly touch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\\*\\*\n\nPrior to the Surface Pro, I had an IBM and then a Lenovo Thinkpad. They started to feel too clunky when I started carrying my computer with me everywhere. I do value something slimmer, something in the ultrabook or lighter weight 15\". (E.G. XPS15, Razer Blade, but not a 17\", and not a fat ugly gaming rig).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\\*\\*\n\nWindows\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\\*\\*\n\n13-15\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\\*\\*\n\nMostly general use, but also would like to be able to play some games, some AI use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\\*\\*\n\nWould be nice to hit at least 60fps for recent games at low-medium settings. Not required for the ultrabook, say, if I got another thin-and-light computer with Thunderbolt connectivity for an eGPU.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\\*\\*\n\n\\-Portability: Ideally portable. Razer Blade 15 is about as heavy as I'm interested in.\n\n\\-Touch: Absolutely need touch-screen. As stated above.\n\n\\-Build quality: I've had some problems with recent computers, so I'm not sold on the idea that one company or another is or isn't great. My IBM Thinkpad after about 5 years of life had issues with overheating despite new thermal paste application (but probably lasted the longest). The Lenovo was never reliable. I switched to the Surface Pro... which was pretty great except for the charging adapter being absolutely terrible and not registering (which I noted with other users as well), and after getting a replacement that worked for some time... it also stopped working very well, and by then I'd run out of memory and wanted something with more I/O... so the Razer Blade Stealth had the expected issue of not registering the battery appropriately, and on day one I had to download a BIOS update (known issue I had seen in one of the reviews when I purchased the computer). I needed to send it in for an RMA due to constant freeze/buzzing issues (they told me they eventually replaced the motherboard). Recently it's been acting up making a loud crackling/buzzing noise (no freezing, not coil whine) that's probably related to the fan, but can go weeks at a time without issue... that's made me reticent to bring my poor computer out in public... Basically I've had a bad experience with Razer, but then again, I've not had the best experience with Microsoft or Lenovo either. Hopefully just bad luck, and the next computer will be a bit luckier...\n\n\\-Ports: I need Thunderbolt since I want the option for an eGPU or a Thunderbolt dock. In the past I've tried a regular USB dock with past computers, and there was too much lag to make it useful. I also want more ports than what Microsoft is offering with any of their new offerings. If they had come up with a Surface Book 3 with updated hardware, I would have been interested. At minimum, I don't want to lose ports (currently USB-C + 2x USB-A and HDMI). XPS 2 in 1 feels ridiculous. One charging USB-C, and one to plug things into. XPS 13 laptop is essentially a step backwards with one USB-C used for charging, one to replace HDMI, would then leave me with one fewer USB port available. Probably fine to get a dock, giving me two USB ports. Spectre 13 similarly loses me a USB port if I didn't have a dock. The new RBS keeps ports, but has other drawbacks. The alternative is getting a 15\" model but losing portability in favor of power and ports.\n\n\\-Memory: I need at least 512GB, preferably NVMe SSD. Would like 16GB+ for RAM, especially for the 13\" models as RAM is usually not upgradeable.\n\n\\-Display: My perfect laptop doesn't exist. If I get a 13\", I don't need to sacrifice battery for 4k since I can't tell the difference anyway, but the only touch options at this size seem to be 4k displays. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\\*\\*\n\nI THINK I've narrowed my list down to two categories, and three options within each (Razer, HP Spectre x360, or Dell XPS):\n\n1. Ultra-portable with plan for a secondary Thunderbolt dock or eGPU\n2. 15\" that still maintains some portability.\n\nUltra-portable:\n\n1. Razer Blade Stealth late 2019:\n   1. Don't lose any ports, maintain a light form factor with improvement in bezels, and actually increased power that would still allow \"light\" gaming.\n   2. The GTX1650 is fine... but comes at the cost of 15w for the CPU, basically throttling the CPU in favor of having a decent GPU. I'm not sure the extra price is worth what really isn't a gaming machine. (Comes in at $1900)\n   3. Honestly would be happy to get an Iris Plus Graphics model, would LOVE Mercury White... but those options are either NOT touch-screen or not 512GB for the SSD. Cheapest touch option (if I am understanding the Razer site) is an MX150 with 8th gen CPU and 4k panel for $1700, and it just doesn't seem to make sense to pay so much for an \"older\" model with a weaker GPU, though true it is an actual dedicated GPU.\n   4. Doesn't have microSD (though I haven't felt like I \"needed\" it as long as I have enough local memory and cloud options).\n2. Dell XPS 13 or XPS 13 2-in-1\n   1. Minimal ports. Boo. But could dock it.\n   2. XPS 13 has the \"other\" Intel 10th gen CPU, so maybe not as optimized for minor graphics/AI? However, it is 6-core, so maybe more powerful. The 2-in-1 uses Iris Plus but is even MORE limited in ports. I am fine with a touch laptop, but if equally viable, I'd go for one that can do full double duty as a hybrid. Again, supposing I use a dock, the port issue is fine? This all assumes that Thunderbolt docks work reasonably well without the lag I've experienced with \"regular\" USB docks.\n   3. XPS 2-in-1 seems to have a non-4k option, which might save some battery life and price.\n   4. Quality control issues?\n3. HP Spectre x360 13, late 2019\n   1. This is what I'm leaning toward. Also lose a port (like the XPS 13), but better than the XPS 2-in-1 and in a similar form factor, with a sleek almost bezel-less design. Would have to dock. Coming in at $1500, so pretty much the cheapest option (or about tied with the XPS13).\n   2. Comes with a pen! lol\n   3. I am having trouble determining if the CPU has 15w or 25w (Iris Plus version of 10th gen). Also not sure if the SSD is NVMe?\n   4. Like the others, only 4k options, though people seem to like the screen, and if the non-touch can reach 22hours (company testing conditions), then the OLED should probably still have reasonable battery life.\n   5. Quality control issues?\n\n15\"\n\n1. Razer Blade 15\n   1. As much as I want one of these, I can't really justify paying $3100 for the cheapest touch option. Unless there's some non-4k, or non-GTX2080 configuration I can get, anything reasonably priced is non-touch. I don't need a fantastic video card, but in the 15\" model, I do want a usable GPU. The reasonably priced ($1700-1800 options) have GTX1060Ti or 2060, but sadly no touch screen. Even with older models.\n   2. Anyone see a perfect Blade out there?\n2. HP Spectre x360 15\n   1. As much as I like the 13 inch model, I haven't really seen any reviews online for the new 15 inch model.\n   2. This is the only 2-in-1 15\" option I'm currently looking at.\n   3. $1700 (or possibly $1530 with discounts), this is the cheapest 15\" model I see among those I'm looking at most closely. However, the GPU seems to be sacrificed, with MX250 as the option.\n3. Dell XPS 15\n   1. This is probably the one I would lean toward. For $2k I could get 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD, lots of ports, GTX1650, touch, on a 6-core 9th gen CPU.\n\nSo basically looking at any experiences people have had with any of the above options. Would love to hear how the new Spectre is working out, if you found a better Razer configuration, if you've had QC issues with Dell or HP or Razer, what you might lean toward. I'm also open to other ideas (I haven't looked too deeply at the Lenovo Yoga models, for instance). I love the Surface lineup in general, but I feel like I'm probably getting more for my money with these options... though it would be nice to have an actual brick-and-mortar option for when any problems arise.

  "Yea, like my dad saw a wrong price on jbls site, 0 euro soundbar, and he ordered one, but then he ordered 15 more. Im pretty sure thats the reason that they catched it. A while ago i saw a wrong price on jbls site, 25 euros for a flip 4 camo. I ordered one and actually recieved it",
  "Most likely true. I work at a very large company and work in picking and shipping orders, and it's generally the same for every company. If a product is in stock and is purchased, the order is automatically added to the queue and dropped in the next wave of orders for the warehouse workers to pick and ship it. \n\nMany times the packlist/order receipt will show the total price of the order, but nobody really pays attention and even if a warehouse grunt sees it, they will assume nothing and still send it out. No managers or financial workers will see the order until well after it is shipped and delivered in most cases",
  "I have worked at a popular grocery store for over a decade. In the U.S. if a store has a price sign in front of a product that indicates an incorrect price, we have to honor it. Otherwise it’s called bait and switch. I have no idea how this is handled online or internationally however.",
  "They don’t. Law undergraduate here. This falls under contract law. A website listing or product is considered as an **invitation to treat**, and not an **offer**. To define an offer, I will quote it from the case of Preston Corpn Sdn Bhd v Edward Leong: An offer is an intimation of willingness by an offeror to enter into a legally binding contract. Its terms either expressly or impliedly must **indicate** that it is to **become binding on the offeror** (buyer) assoon as it has been **accepted by the offeree** (seller).\n\nEven if the customer were to send an offer (by checking out), a **binding contract** is not yet formed because Lenovo has yet to accept that offer and they can choose to back out as there is no **legally enforceable agreement** yet. (A confirmation email is also not signifying of acceptance of order!)\n\nA similar example to this would be Chwee Kin Keong v Digiland Mall Pte Ltd. TLDR is that an employee keyed in a pricing for a product at $66 instead of $3,854 (MSRP) and the company obviously didn’t want to fulfil orders that were made and got taken to court. Court ruled in the company’s favour.\n\nIn consumer court, courts do consistently rule in favour of the seller during obvious pricing mistakes like a $1 phone etc. because they take the view of a **reasonable person in consideration and apply the objectivity test**. \n\nFor example, in this case, the court said:\n“I find ... that the plaintiffs, given each of their backgrounds, would in any event, each have separately realised and appreciated, before placing their purchase orders,that a manifest mistake had occurred – even if no communications on the error had taken place between them. Further, the character of the mistake was such that **any reasonable person** similarly circumstanced as each of the plaintiffs would have had every reason to believe that a manifest error had occurred.” . \n\nOtherwise, the court would also simply treat it as a **clerical or unilateral mistake** and not punish the seller. Similarly in this case, Lenovo would win.\n\nIf there’s any Law graduates reading this and want to improve on my stand, please do! I’m still studying and open to improvement",
  "Nope where it's clearly a mistake and you know it, they don't need to honour it",
  "They are not and three seconds of googling will support that. Just because you once managed to slip one through doesn’t mean that’s the law.\n\nImagine a computer store mislabelling a €4000 laptop at €1 and a large amount of units are ordered overnight while nobody’s at work. Your argument is that EU law now effectively forces this company into bankruptcy by being required to honor these sales that were clearly made exploiting an error in pricing?",
  "No....",
  "Depends on the Ts and Cs",
  "Yeah.... depends on if that's enforceable to a website in another country.... Much like the GDPR fines the EU charges.... a US website isn't subject to that....  even if they decide to keep data on you... because they're not breaking THEIR laws.",
  "had this happen in the us with a 5000 dollar tv listed for 5.\n\n  \nthey cancelled the order and gave us a 20 dollar off of 100 or more coupon.\n\n  \nthis was on Samsungs website a few years back.\n\n  \nmaybe the uk is protected against this somehow but I’m almost positive there’s some loophole that companies could take advantage of to cancel it. regardless, it’s worth a try if it’s from the legit website",
  "Well it's the same in other accounts too",
  "This is the way to do it imo.",
  "I don't think that's how it works. Especially considering that OP is checking it on a phone. Like imagine if disc.google.com could be swapped by something malicious? \n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but aren't sites check response and then send info about a site, judging from 1) the subdomain, 2) the page (/in) and then parse arguments passed in the url if there are any? It's server-client thing – client sends response (get/post etc.), site's backend transfers specific data to the client (rendering the page if needed and so on). Done.",

So in any jurisdiction, I’m highly confident that Lenovo would win should this be taken to court. \n\nIf you search up similar topics, you will find that across common law (Singapore, UK, US) and civil law (France, Germany, EU), the courts follow the same reasoning:\n1.\tObvious pricing errors = no binding contract.\n2.\tBuyers cannot exploit a mistake they recognize.\n3.\tThe worst that happens to the retailer is refunding the money.\n\nHowever, if we are referring to say, a $599 MSRP laptop being listed erroneously at $499, the court may order the seller to honor some of the orders, which has happened in many jurisdictions before, since borderline errors (e.g., 10–25% off normal price) can be interpreted as a discount/promotion and would lead a reasonable person to believe that there is no mistake in pricing.\n\nIn this case though, it’s a laptop for $1. So it’s pretty obvious and no court would side with the buyer.",
  "Incorrect.\nTL;DR Lenovo (and most other companies) explicitly states that a confirmation email does **NOT** signify acceptance of the order. **No acceptance = No contract.** (This clause is commonplace for every business) Consumer will lose if he tries to go to court, even if he has the best lawyer. Below, I will cite Lenovo.\n\n**Full explanation:**\n\nA confirmation email, if you dig deep into any businesses’s Terms and Conditions (the thing that everyone ignores), has built in protective clauses in their Terms of Sale, and they’re not obliged to provide the consumer with any goods or service with a confirmation email alone. **Confirmation email ≠ acceptance.** A confirmation email only signifies that they have **received** the order.\n\nHere, I will specifically cite for this case, Lenovo. Under their T&Cs, it clearly states that **a confirmation of Lenovo receiving and/or processing your order does not constitute acceptance of the order.** (1.2)\n\nSource: https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/legal/new-products-and-warranty-services/?srsltid=AfmBOop9YcXqtlgbWWSEtLd4WCy7paTFtCMABKIs8xZmfYyPvIBRyTbc&ut\n\nIt also states under 1.1 that:\n\n1.1) **No contract** for the purchase of Products or Services will be formed until Lenovo accepts your Order by **one of the following**:\n\n**(a)** shipping the hardware Product and sending you a shipment confirmation email; or\n\n**(b)** making the software Product available to you; or\n\n**(c)** providing the Service to you.\n\nTherefore, that confirmation email is **not a binding acceptance** and is more of an acknowledgment that they’ve received your order and are processing it. Until shipping occurs (or software is delivered, etc.), Lenovo **reserves the right** to cancel or adjust your order **even if** you’ve already received a confirmation email or any other form of confirmation.\n\nI personally think that TV shows these days make the law seem very shallow to the average person, like; “Little guy sues company and wins!”. \n\nThe reality is, that every business has multiple built in protective and failsafe clauses layered into their contracts etc. to make sure that real consumers **will never win against them** in court. I feel like the average person should read more into the T&Cs so they know what they’re getting themselves into, but we don’t, so companies take advantage of that; and that is why we have lawyers :)",

And also, way to deflect from the question about legislation ;)\n\n“A couple ten thousand dollars” in this case would be 5-10 laptops sold at the wrong price. You can see from this topic that ppl flock to these things like moths to a flame.\n\nMy most commonly used online computer store typically has a stock of about 50 of each gaming laptop, do the math on a say 5 of those products being mislabeled overnight and each those selling out at a €3999 discount.

  "Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Gen 6: First impressions I purchased the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G6, model 21NQCTO1WWBR1 on July 2025 and would like to make my impressions about this product:\n\nDESIGN AND BUILD: We don't have much to comment on the design, as it's quite minimalist. We're surprised that not all the keyboard keys follow Lenovo's signature layout, as is typical on IdeaPads, but at least the Ctrl and Fn keys are in their traditional positions, unlike ThinkPads. The light color isn't bad, but it's a shame there wasn't a darker color option (not black, which is typically only seen on ThinkPads, but a darker gray would have been nice). The touchpad is a good size. We found the number of ports interesting, but the Ethernet port's position wasn't particularly helpful, being on the right side. It's interesting that it also has an SD card reader. The number of LEDs also caught our attention, with one next to each USB-C port, in addition to the power button itself (which we really like being separate from the keyboard). We liked the backlit keyboard and the dedicated \"?\", \"/\", \"°\", and \"Menu\" keys, although they sacrificed one of the Ctrl keys. At least it didn't come with the \"Copilot\" shortcut. We didn't really like the notch in the webcam area and found it a rather questionable design decision, but we understand its usefulness. We also liked that it came without those infamous labels on the palm rest, just the Intel seal.\n\nSCREEN: We liked the quality of the IPS, but we were disappointed that the screen had excessive IPS Glow at the bottom edge, quite visible with the screen on a black background even in bright light. My brother was okay with it, but I didn't like this defect at all, which I'm already accepting is quite common in current LCD screens, as I've also seen notebooks and even smartphones and tablets from other brands with this issue. It shouldn't happen, but we've come to understand that IPS Glow is now part of the experience of having an IPS LCD screen, which is unfortunate. At least we like the thin bezels.\n\nSOUND AND WEBCAM: Neither impressed in any aspect, but neither disappointed.\n\nBATTERY AND CHARGING: The USB-C charger is interesting. My brother tested it by playing YouTube videos in 1080p with maximum brightness, and it lasted over 5 hours unplugged. For a 60Wh battery, it's an okay battery, but it could be better.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND USABILITY: Regarding performance, considering its specifications, I consider it okay. It worked very well even for running virtual machines via VirtualBox. We didn't notice excessive heat on the keyboard when heavily loaded. My brother installed the Big Linux distro, and in testing, it has worked well, including mirroring the laptop screen to our Smart TV wirelessly. My brother was unable to get BlissOS, based on Android 13, to work, as it didn't recognize Wi-Fi, but emulating Android on Big Linux with WayDroid has worked well most of the time.\n\n**Have you also purchased a Lenovo ThinkBook? Share your experiences with it in the comments below.**",

I use it mainly for college stuff, and it can handle an entire day of coding, browsing the internet and even playing some light games (such as Horizon Chase). \n\nBattery life on it is quite impressive on linux. I get 6-8h of usage with it. That's more than i get with Windows (i have no idea why i just get 3-5 hours on Windows), but i've seen some minor compatibility issues on linux, such as the mute key not lighting up or the volume keys getting \"sticky\" (if i hold it a little bit, it goes to max volume or 0), but overall, the laptop is very usable.\n\nI plan to upgrade to 16gb soon, because on my use case, 8gb is too low, especially when i get 16 tabs open for research + some niche software from 10 years and VScode.\n\nOBS: Você é o CAVBR do fórum Adrenaline, não é?",

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "LOCKED BIOS - Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE) I bought a Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE) at an auction. The BIOS/UEFI is locked with a Supervisor Password. A repair shop reflashed both EEPROMs from scratch (64 MB BIOS REGION and 16 MB ME REGION), but the password remained.

  "Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review I bought this Chromebook about a week ago from  Curry's in the UK as the top spec had a deal on for £599.\n\nMy honest opinion using it for my business is that it nails it with only one downside. \n\nI run my own business Functional Drinks Club which has bricks and mortar stores and an online store. \n\nI'm also a Fractional CMO for a UK based tech company. \n\nI hate the Apple OS and eco-system, so Macbooks are always out for me. \n\nAnd I hate how even the best window laptops can get slowed down with anti-virus software and other various plug-inside just to keep them safe while I'm working from different locations. \n\nSo, the Chromebook was always going to get my interest. \n\nWhat I mainly use it for:\n\nShopify Store Management\nMeta Ad Management\nSocial Media Managament\nG-Suite (Pro Business Account)\nSocial Media Creation (FB, Insta, Tik Tok, LinkedIn, YT) \nQuickbooks Accountant Software \nVideo Call Meetings \nCanva - Design needs\nRiverside.Fm for video podcasts and basic editinf\nHubspot CRM Management \n\nI can safely say that it nailed all of the above with aplomb, and because I like to be mobile it's the perfect laptop (not just chromebook) for my business. \n\nNote: I don't do heavy, complex video editing as part of the above.  \n\nThe only downside is that when it comes to printing shipping labels from shopify it only recognises known brand names when it comes to label printers. \n\nThere is a workaround extension for it, but it's a pain in the butt if I'm honest to get working.\n\nThat's it. \n\nI use the Chromebook as my day to day now and I'm not going back.

  "Lenovo Thinkpad T16 Gen 4 - worth waiting for?? I have been searching for a new laptop and leaning towards the Thinkpad T16. Truth is that i'm pretty desperate for a replacement laptop as i'm using a Samsung which is about 13 years old and the display is terrible. I have seen that the Thinkpad T16 Gen 4 is going to be released in May / June. \n\nThe current Lenovo range is Gen 3 (intel only) or if I wanted AMD it's the Gen 2 with soldered RAM which isn't great from an upgradability perspective. I imagine the AMD version will be slightly cheaper than intel and am not overly bothered about Intel vs AMD. \n\nThe difference from what I have seen between Gen 3 and Gen 4 doesn't look hugely drastic. Is it worth waiting for Gen 4 and possibly buying AMD and saving some money? Or just pick up a Gen 3 Intel now? ",
  "I’m in a similar situation but my current laptop is still functioning, just very slow. I am planning to wait for gen 4 because the performance on gen 3 intel chips seems pretty underwhelming.",
  "Did you finally buy it?",
  "If you're going to pay the same sort of price then probably makes sense to spend it on the latest model. I assume the Gen 3 aren't selling at a discount currently.",
  "I noticed that Gen 4 AMD seems to be available in my country. Either with AMD Ryzen AI 5 PRO 340 or AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 Processor. I'm guessing this is a small improvement over the Ryzen 7? There's a variety of RAM options and I don't think it's soldered. Those seem to be the main differences and it comes with the bigger battery as standard and some brighter display options.",
  "haha....that's a question! I did buy the AMD Gen 4 version with AI 7 PRO 350 processor. After about a week or so I noticed when I was watching a video on YouTube / Twitch and I made it full screen, there was briefly some white lines across the screen. I also noticed if the room was quiet and I went to load up a page or something that there was a soft click each time. I started threads on here about these issues. Chat GPT said the lines could be a graphical glitch or maybe some incompatibility with drivers. I did try some troubleshooting steps and was unable to resolve it. Lenovo Tech Support got in contact and were going to arrange a repair but I didn't want to start getting into the repair process within a few weeks so I returned the laptop. They were fairly minor niggles but i'd spent a lot on the computer and thought it shouldn't have these issues after a few weeks. \n\nI have been doing research for what to buy next and can't decide between Elitebook or T16 intel version. I might try the intel version and hope the issues were down to AMD and drivers - or that the computer I got from Lenovo initially was a lemon.",

And while neither will ever be mistaken for a high efficiency CPU, the 7735HS will deliver slightly better battery life when all else is equal.",
  "I was thinking that they weren’t too different. Good to hear that the 7735hs is better cause the laptop is cheaper right now. Is there any other lenovo or any other laptop under $1k that you would recommend for college/light gaming?",
  "So, just to make extra sure I'm understanding correctly since I have the same question, it's the gen 7 that comes out on top?",
  "It'd be worth looking at the E series ThinkPad.  Probably a little more expensive, but the Gen6 AMD or Gen7 Intel that should be available if you're not in the US offers a massively nicer display (optional) to the ThinkBook.  If in the US, then probably nothing you're going to find will be significantly better in this price range since the 2.2K display isn't offered here for the G6 AMD, and the G7 Intel is taking FOREVER to be released here.",

  "Asus Vivobook S16 OLED (S5606CA) or wait for Lenovo ThinkPad T16 Gen 4? Hey folks, I’m torn between getting the **Asus Vivobook S16 OLED (S5606CA)** now or waiting for the **Lenovo ThinkPad T16 Gen 4**.\n\nI’ll mainly use it for work — I run a company (SemioDigital), and I’m a sysadmin with a focus on Linux and cybersecurity. I’ll also do some light content creation on the side.\n\nThe **Vivobook** is tempting: for the price, you get a latest-gen i7, solid performance, light chassis, good battery, and that OLED screen is just gorgeous… but glossy.\n\nOn the other hand, the **ThinkPad** is a business classic — more rugged, easier to service, has a matte display (less pretty but more practical), and overall better for long-term use. The downside is that it’s heavier, the current screen isn’t great (compared to the oled), and I’d have to wait for the Gen 4 to match the Vivobook’s specs — at a higher price.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar dilemma? Thoughts?",
  "Why not the vivo book with the HX370?",
  "I've briefly had vivobook with hx370 - mediatek wifi was basically unusable ( newest firmware, newest kernel on ubuntu). So what i've done is configured a environemnt and that's it - but seemed to work great other than that wifi issue, and some random internet guy have said that havent got the same issue as mine.  \n  \nNow i'm rocking intel core ultra 255h version of that vivobook, and it has some weird performance issues - something like it would be heavily bottlenecked with storage? Or maybe sometimes it let's those ultra efficient cores to work on something? Not sure, \"wait\" in top rises, nothing is happening when it should be launching an app.  \nIt does work slower under linux when it comes to blender. Some blender operations do impact whole system, and it can freeze.\n\nIt is maybe because of some drivers are not ready yet?\n\nGlossy screen in great indoors, somewhat useable outside - especially in shadowed area.\n\nIt gives me about 6hours of battery under linux, while doing some light coding. Not great, but kindof enough for me.  \nIt does throttle heavily while charging(sic!) - something is triggering PROCHOT.

They stopped manufacturing their own drivers. Which means you have to use the windows update to update drivers, the issue is selective sleep and bios updates. The EPA created the requirement for selective sleep, so no disabling it.

Other things to look at are how well they are documented by manufacturers and how much support they provide. If you go with the thinkpad, they have decent support from my experience and if they can’t help then you are almost guaranteed an answer from r/thinkpad",

  "Legion. Lesser cost, better graphics, great durability and experience. Might be bit heavy",
  "They all suck",
  "How's a 4060 being sold at this price?",
  "I notice this is from a campus school store. If you aren’t using financial aid or student loans to get these, I would say don’t buy from them and go to a bestbuy. You can get this years models for much less.",
  "I have the dell from work, as a replacement for a hp z. More compact frame and lighter than the hp which is a plus. Only 2 USB c ports both on the left, one of which is the power jack, so if you have  multiple USB accessories it's a pain. The paint layer on the dell chassis is very thin. Scratched very easily, the first time I observed this on a laptop and I have used lenovos, hp and MacBooks. The fan is noisy. Keyboard feels good better than the hp. Hate the trackpad though. The click sections on the trackpad are at the bottom instead of the top which is horrible design per my preference.",

  "These laptops are ridiculously overpriced",
  "ThinkPad since you say engineering. The legion's battery life will be bad since its a gaming laptop and the gpu consumes more power than my electricity guzzling laptop.

  "Legion 5 just because it has the RTX 4080 which will be pretty great for gaming., I have the desktop version and it's a beast.  But honestly... they are all terrible for that price. If you're gonna be using it for work/school and no gaming then probably the Dell.",

If I could upgrade both machines I'd choose the first one because a great screen is a godsend for your eyes.

  "Omg is this Wolfpack outfitters???? Maybe other colleges are using the same descriptions but I literally see these in the bookstore. The P1 G7 is really light but will also work good for the CAD necessary for engineering. The legions are really heavy, I got one and never take it anywhere bc it is heavy. The P1 is probably the most portable. See if you can find it cheaper online, Lenovo has awesome student discounts and you can usually negotiate cart threshold discounts as well with customer service online.",

  "The legion is far faster than the rest, but all rather expensive. The Thinkpad is the most reliable.\n\nIf you are not gaming or using CAD, consider a recent APU option. I have doubts about longetivity on laptop gpus, although I guess the latter 2 are more reliable compared to the 4060.\n\nThe nits on the Dell is simply poor and no mention of IPS/OLED suspicious.",

  "Two letters PC",
  "Whatever you do, not the thinkpad.",
  "14th gen is defective, also very inefficient. Avoid if possible. I would grab the thinkpad, but if these are $2.5K usd then they are all terribly overpriced",
  "Buy MacBook and Switch 2 or Steam Deck OLED.",
  "All of them have bad display and bad build quality and they are expensive, feels weird saying this but the MacBook Pro is an amazing deal compared to these. You are getting one of the best laptop displays, probably the best sound system, definitely the best build quality, trackpad and speakers, also the battery life is great",
  "Terrible deal in aud as well",
  "Even if it's cad or sgd lol",
  "Terrible deal even in canadian as well.",
  "In Vietnamese dollars, it would be an amazing deal. 😂",
  "P1 for a few reasons: Despite the smaller VRAM, it's an enterprise grade workstation with long term hardware and firmware support. Most replacement parts are easy to get through their website, Based on my personal experience repairing dozens of them, it's also fairly easy to upgrade the RAM and SSD. Also Lenovo's ThinkPad series in general is preferred in high cybersecurity environments because of their resistance to certain kinds of hardware based attacks. I've seen them in police departments and boardrooms.",
  "What kind of engineering",
  "When I run heavy science computations, for example finite element models or dimensionality reductions on large datasets, the limiting factor is always the RAM. These are all relatively low RAM. \n\nOn the other hand, science software including FEM is so far not designed to take advantage of the GPU. \n\nSo these computers are simultaneously more expensive than needed, and not very powerful for the sake of engineering computations imo. \n\nI'd max the RAM, pick a fairly good CPU, and save on graphics and other bells and whistles.",
  "What workloads will you be using?",
  "I feel like you could find this so much cheaper if you find the exact model in an open box or used atleast, these prices are astronomical and they depreciate the moment you own it 💔",
  "All of these are way overkill for most kinds of engineering, what kind are you doing? I run aerospace CAD on huge assemblies on something that probably cost half of this.\n\nIf you want to game as well I'd used the savings to buy an xbox or PlayStation, unless you insist on mobile gaming",

  "Why not a MacBook. M5 Max's GPU is forecasted to be as good as a 4070",
  "I'll keep that in mind. I have a pretty solid Idea pad that's been an absolute workhorse, and is very durable and reliable but that's the last Lenovo I'll have for a while. I'll go with Dell next.",
  "I agree with you. The Dell laptop has much better specs and I don't feel that's an opinion I feel that is critically accurate.",
  "CAD, circuits, AutoDesk, etc",
  "Yea the guy that recommended these said for work productivity he said go for the dell",
  "Forgot to mention, the thinkpad has a 90wh battery while the dell has a 64wh battery and higher, more power hungry specs",
  "From the small print at the bottom looks like a campus school store.",
  "It’s paid by my job and it has to be from this store",
  "thats a 4060",
  "fuck no. the 1000 ada is worse than a 4050.",
  "Damn, you are spot on with the location. Yes it is wolfpack outfitters. Also my job is paying for the laptop any amount here for free for me. Hence why I need to get it here.",
  "Ahhh for what they do they are not overpriced. It is standard price. They are technically made for intensive task that professionals use like autodesk, photoshop, CAD, circuits, etc. make it run fast and smooth not met for gaming. Except for the legion, which is met for gaming .",
  "MacBook sucks ass for engineering, and I don’t have time to game. Even though I already have the switch 2.",
  "I disagree, for engineering no. These laptops are pretty standard price for what they offer to people in the engineering field. We don’t care about the bells and whistles we want raw performance. To make CAD, Autodesk, circuits work fast and efficiently. Even using AI.",
  "This 100%",
  "Vs code🥀",
  "Why buy a console? If you're already paying for a new laptop just pay for a better one instead of a just fine one and a console",
  "Where’d he get it? Just the website? I’m boutta buy one :)",
  "Its that most people dont have time bc to find a deal you need to look out on shops lets say once a week and go to different locations or get lucky",
  "Get the legion.",
  "Will they do special orders? Many college bookstores will.",
  "All blantant ripoffs, Go for the legion, still gets the job done and more cheaper",
  "Yeah but the first one the Ada gpus are for cad and such but the first one can still do cad and whatever else ya want like gaming too!",
  "**sighs deeply **",
  "But one is gaming other is enterprise grade",
  "Just o offer a counterpoint: I have had a Legion 5i for about 5 years now, and it's worked perfectly for me all the years. Decent Battery, no problems with performance (don't know about any special programs you might need it for for engineering, but since it's rated to run most AAA games it should be fine i guess).\n\nOnly recently has the screen started to malfunction in the lower 10%, i guess from tiny bends in the lid.\n\nAnd portability isn't the best, but that was to be expected.\n\nNo problems with trackpad placing here.",
  "Horrible for engineering. No support for solidworks (unless you use cloud but even then thats just ass) cant run any simulation programs like ansys, catia, etc or using creo. Would be great if he was graphic design running adobe tho. if an engineer NEVER BUY APPLE! (nothing against apple just lacks major compatibility with engineering software)",
  "because if they need high-performance rendering, they will want a 50-series card for the best possible times. Also an m5 max macbook will be CONSIDERABLY more expensive than $2500 factoring in the price to upgrade to a decent amount of RAM and storage",
  "Honestly I think they make better feeling hardware, they just feel built well, and outside of this issue, they were decent machines, but this is a big issue in a business scenario and really annoying if you use a docking station.. Since that same daughter card and sleep BS causes the stupid docking station to randomly disconnect and reconnect..",
  "Then pretty much any of those will do I think.",
  "yes that has better gpu and cpu for your engineering stuff.",
  "You should really look somewhere else, that's a 5080 price category",
  "Understood. Dell easily unless you’re working heavily with assemblies and simulations, in which case the Legion would be slightly better. Good luck!",
  "Oh my bad you're right... It is a 4060. Still is a pretty solid GPU.",
  "Why does that matter  unless the OP wants a gaming laptop.",
  "The guy im about to buy in store said they are coming out with the new thinkpad Lenovo with Blackwell Nvidia RTX 2000 with same CPU. What do you think?",
  "It's a \"gaming laptop\" so automatically inferior",
  "Ohhh okay well like I said the p1 is light. Most engineering students I’ve met so far have that laptop and love it. It’s very portable. Sometimes the bookstore sells a 3299 thinkpad that is an absolute beast.",
  "Kinda depends on the engineering, lol.",
  "User issue. ",
  "The m4 pro multicore is faster than all of those and the gpu isn’t bad either. The only problem you could have is macOS and arm, Most of the Autodesk suite works natively on arm. All i am saying is just consider it. Altium doesn’t run natively though.",
  "1 tab of chrome",
  "Why must you hurt me in this way",
  "Also the new Xbox coming out will have windows. And like 1200. So its a pc... Definitely buy a standalone Pc/laptop. 🙂",
  "A local shop in Syria.",
  "Get the Dell.",
  "It's not the laptop's fault that you chose to use something that's deprecated?",
  "Eh. I don't see the point of purchasing a high end laptop solely for its GPU. If I did it would be for a PC.",
  "Right. I love my Lenovo IdeaPad and it was way ahead of its time like 7 years ago. i7, 16 GB RAM, 256 SSD and 1TB storage drive, SDHC slot, good built in speakers, black brushed aluminum cover... This thing is solid many years later. I have dropped it down the stairs, left it in a hot car in Florida for a few days, ETC... This thing won't quit on me. It's my work PC now.",
  "Definitely, would choose legion cuz its cheaper",
  "The 2000 Blackwell is midway through a 5050m and 5060m, it’s better than all of the choices in the post so why not if it’s at the same price. The currency is what ? USD, CAD, AUD ?",
  "no, the P1 is a workstation laptop. this P1 is an underspecced workstation laptop",
  "how does that make any sense? the cpu and gpu in the legion is objectively better than the thinkpad. just because it’s advertised for gaming doesn’t automatically somehow make it worse",
  "I saw that one but was like no. I need portable laptops not a machine 😂 They had a $2999 but they sold out. He told me if I can wait I will get the RTX Maxwell 8GB ada GPU. With an upgraded cpu. So I was like might as wait for a bit",
  "Firsthand experience brotato nugget 😔✌️🥀",
  "those are industry standard softwares, I have never seen an engineering firm have macs/apple os computers.. just the reality of the engineering industry. Windows is necessary due to that",
  "if they want the 'best' laptop for their \\~$2500 budget, I am going to reccommend the laptops that have the best components.  Both are also considerably less than their budget. I could say to spend $800 on a lenovo slim 7i aura but that isn't the kind of laptop theyre looking at, so there's no point and it isnt useful",
  "You are DEFINITELY NOT gonna like the new ideapads",
  "He’s not the one  paying his job is",
  "USD keep in mind I’m not paying for this. My company is and they are the ones that said it must be from this store.",
  "It is worse though. Try to travel with a gaming laptop and see how much the build quality and battery life matter, also see for yourself how much a better brighter screen is needed. Also when the board dies for no reason at all you will understand why those enterprise laptops just cost more",
  "If I had 800 dollars I would buy a MacBook m4 air. It has about twice the CPU throughput of the slim",
  "Nope I can't imagine that I would. I have to get a Windows 11 machine for work soon so I'm really dreading it. Got any recommendations? I just need a good processor and 16-32 GB of RAM. I have a separate gaming rig so the laptop will be only for work",
  "Oh, definitely p series lenovo, if its dedicated to work only",
  "What a fucking rip off, I’ve seen better deals at a Disneyland park. If the RTX 2000 Blackwell is the same price as the Dell or a tiny bit more get that then, also depends on the laptop, will it be a Thinkpad P1 or else ?",
  "build quality of my machine is more than fine, an aluminum chassis can hold up against regular use. my 500 nits panel is no HDR1000 but is more than fine and brighter than most displays. cleaning your internals\\fans once every couple months and monitoring temps like you would with any high-performance computer can prevent potential internal faults. idk why u think “gaming” laptops are so much worse. if we are speaking anecdotally, a professor of mine’s thinkpad died “for no reason” just a couple weeks ago, so enterprise laptops definitely aren’t immune to what you speak of",
  "engineering CAD stuff is generally specialised and might not run on MacOS, my point was that some laptops don't meet the brief.",
  "Unless you spend a lot of moolahs, nope",
  "Yes it’ll be a think pad P1Gen8. Will have the new cpu and the RTX Pro Maxwell or Blackwell 2000? It’s one of those but it’s a brand new GPU.",
  "Thought so. I'm just gonna tell my job I can't afford it at this time.",
  "It’s going to be Blackwell, Maxwell was used 10 years ago. Unless they decided to pair a 285H with an MX450. As a general rule of thumb for professional GPUs never go with the 1000 or below version, consider 2000 the bare minimum/budget, 3000 mid range (can give you some benefits from here like improved cooling on Zbooks) and above you’re getting in high and highest end territory.\n\nYeah get that then, those are the only options in the store or anything else Blackwell or Zbook Fury ? While they’re pricy if you’re not paying for it might aswell get something good",
  "Which stick of RAM is compatible with the Lenovo Thinkbook 15 Gen 3 (AMD)? I found both of these RAM sticks on the Crucial website, and both say that they are compatible.\nIs this true?",

  "What are you planning to use it for? A secondary storage? They're fine.\n\nBut for boot drive? The P3 isn't recommended, because it's DRAM less. I'd lean more towards T500.\n\nBut you should look at your laptop's supported PCIE gen, if it's only gen3 then you'll be limited to gen3 speeds even when you use gen4 sticks (don't worry, they're backwards compatible).",

As far as I know, for 2TB size, only Samsung that have single-sided sticks (they use 1TB NAND chips each to make it possible). There's still plenty of single-sided choices though for 1TB size. Make sure you ask the seller or look for reviews for that specific size. \n\nOn my current laptop (HP Omen16 2021), I have 2 slots, but only one slot that can fit double-sided NVMe. The other one can only fit single-sided sticks since the bottom of the socket has a piece of metal that connects directly to the cooling system to actively help cooling the NVME. On the other hand, my older laptop (MSI P65 Prestige), have two sockets as well but both sockets support double-sided sticks.",

Perhaps something like a second-hand HP EliteBook 800 series (G7 or G8), I got my EliteBook 845 G7 for the equivalent of 25k INR for a Ryzen 3 4450U model (still great for programming) and have already put 64GB RAM on it. It's mostly similar to a Macbook Air, complete with its pretty good battery life (not as good, but good for the size of the battery and can even run off of a 20W charger) and quiet operation, and that's a superb laptop considering the price and what you get for it.",

Anything that sells like hot cakes is gonna have more examples of “issues” on the internet. \n\nNot sure what your problem with the build quality is, the two M1 Airs I had (sold one to buy one with more storage) were much better built than the Thinkpads I hand out at work, though they are X1 Carbons, and I think they’re shit, the X250 I used to use is quite nice. \n\nI’m not gonna fight for the XPS, mine were both shit, 13 and 15, I was just using that as an example of “overpriced” Windows laptops existing too.\n\nTo be completely honest, I usually stay away from Thinkpads because of the keyboard. I can never get used to it, probably because I change laptops a lot.",

That previous post wasn't really gymnastics, it was painful to read and didn't make much sense. \n\nx86 generally offers better value for budget conscious users, more power for very high perf users that require heavy GPU, CPU and /or can't use macOS. Macs problem is its super expensive for what it is. Other big issue is arm on Mac+windows is not compatible with discreet performance GPU options. \n\nThe bigger reason however is compatibility on windows, arm is fantastic for most web/office users and I highly recommend it. But for those using discreet apps it's not fully ideal yet. Support is a problem for weird kernel level apps (AV, anti cheat, scanners) and some other oddities, last time I checked Google drive sync tool didn't work on Windows arm.

Software like this would need to be completely rewritten for arm as the underlying architecture is different and windows arm does not allow as much access to the kernel level (this is good for your security and matches what macOS does). \n\nOverall anti cheat is not something most people or institutions use, my college didn't use it for exams on personal machines (they did on college machines for end of year exams).

But the strong facts are that it can be disabled and the data is stored on the device only. \n\nAs hardware the snapdragon X machines are very very good for the majority standard use case of web and office. They're fast and efficient.  The unfortunate truth for you is that most good laptop hardware in the near future will support MS Copilot features, it's not just snapdragon equipped machines.

  "Upgradability is the major reason I didn't buy mac for my last upgrade. Most premium laptops will solder ram (some manufacturers are reversing this) but almost all will allow SSD upgrades. With Mac you just need to make sure you pay their theft level prices for upgrades and get what you need at point of purchase. \n\nAs for not aging we'll and hinge/display/keyboard issues your not correct. Keyboard issues was a massive problem on 2016-2018 models with that stupid butterfly keyboard but that is no more, current magic keyboard is very reliable. Display and hinge issues are no worse than any other manufacturer, in fact I'd say better.  \n\nAging is a different story, macs age very well but they go downhill very quick when apple stop supporting them. Apple supports a Mac for 7-8yrs (which I think is a fair laptop life). It annoys me when people buy macs on the assumption it will last longer and last over 10yrs (it won't). Quality windows laptops from 2016 (intel 6th gen) onwards have just as long of life and in that regard macs are no better. My 2016 windows laptop is 9yrs old and still perfectly fine, it will be upgraded only because windows 10 is no longer supported soon and MS blocked win11 on devices older than 2018.",

And although it's expensive for newer machines, older machines like the M1/M2 series can be easily found in the sub £1000 range, and they absolutely decimate any x86 machine in every metric.\n\nAnd tbh I've never felt the need to install an antivirus on a windows or especially a mac machine.

Corporate laptops have encryption for data at rest and there are security layers. This has been the way for long. Never had issues wit laptops in the past. This one though with Core i5 1345U though is bad in battery life. Previous laptop with 7th gen Core i5 used to last 5 hours or so. This one barely lasts 2 hours. \n\nWhen major OS update happened, as there is encryption enabled on disk, these chips struggled in a big way. Even when not, they are average at best for development and compilation.

And as someone who has repaired some laptops, has helped several people with choosing laptops and PC parts in the past, I repeat, you can't trust one brand, what you have to do for laptops  is, after reducing your choices to 2-4 models you need to look at what people are saying about the model, make sure there's not a lot complaints about something related to the hardware because then you'll be regretting your purchase.

BUT even said that their are issues ( like even buying new you need to do a re paste the CPU/GPU from the factory ) WHICH IS FUCKING ABSURD FOR A NEW UNIT, LET ALONE A CORPATE/BUSINESS CLASS LAPTOP !!!!\n\nFact of the matter is 90% of the PC laptop space has been skirting by with shit build quality for years. You have to pay out of the nose for anything close to good build quality and decent thermals that if you dont need or want the highest specs i either buy a used 1-2 year old laptop with good reviews or wait till what i want spec to get replaced by a newer generation and buy on clearance ( since i know they have fixed any major bugs on that platform ) .   \n  \nmy point is ALL laptop makers put out shits in the under 2000$ space now a days. most gaming laptops under a 1000$ wont even last 5 years. I work in dusty / high vibration environments so much so that i would have spinning HD fail on me before HD went SSD / M2 drives. So my point of view might be skewed to the extremes, but at your price point i would of gotten a used 2-3 year old thinkpad / business class laptop with better specs that is well reviewed then buying a new consumer grade laptop. And before you wanna paint me as a Lenovo fan boy i would never buy one of their consumer grade laptops new or used. \n\nEspecially if your not gaming i would never buy a new consumer grade laptop, when business class laptops can be had in the sub 500$ that build quality wise would run circles around the cheap crap companies are selling to regular users. if you insist on buying new ( and for not gaming ) you should also be buying ryzen tho, intel give you crap battery life. \n\nin the end you get what you pay for, if you expect a sub 400$ new laptop to feel nice and have good build qualty the buddy you need to adjust your expectations. decent laptops cost decent money, if you want qualty for that kind of money your way better off buying used and 2-3 generations older.",

  "Honestly, I'd say just look at what specifications meet your needs and then just go and look in the store if it's a shoddy design. Typically, when you're looking for exterior risks, you should look for mixed materials,  IE the hinges are different than the body and don't have a good tolerance for motion. If it's wobbly on the hinge when you buy it, it likely will break apart when the hinge wears out. \n\nPersonally, I have a lenovo yoga 9i with a pretty beefy hinge, which has served me solidly for four years now. But you don't need a beefy hinge like that. All the yogas have good hinges. I haven't really seen many non-transforming Windows laptops in a while, so I can't comment on hinges that don't have 360 capabilities.  The mid-range Dell inspirions(up to $900) will survive, though Im not sure how long. Asus and acer both have good models. If the base price is a bargain for the components, it's likely a bad model. The only feasible bargain is an open box or end of year discounting. \n\nCPU wise, don't pick some 6 core beast. For office work, you'd be best off picking a 4 core laptop with decently high clock speed and good turbo max speeds. Most of the time you're only using one or two cores. A GPU is likely to be a huge upcharge and also might hinder the CPU speeds for lower cost models since they will move more of the budget towards the GPU.",

  "No laptop is going to be perfect - the laptop you have, or the laptop you can afford, is going to be the best fit for you.  Consumer opinions tend to be driven by circumstance.  Based on your knowledge of the true meaning of HP, I'm guessing you happen to watch a certain laptop repair tech on Youtube - I tend to align pretty well with his opinions on laptops.  My only issue with the HP spec that you have listed is the i3 CPU - low class Intel silicon is not a very good fit for the workloads you've described.  Considering that my daily use ultrabook is a 7th gen core i7 ThinkPad, and my workstation is an aging quad core 4th gen i7 mobile workhorse (Also from the thinkpad lineup) my opinion may not hold much weight - but even a newish i3 seems woefully underspecced for your workload.  I'd also prioritize business laptops - ThinkPad, HP Elitebook, or Dell's Precision or Latitude lineup.  Consumer grade laptops are built to be replaceable toys - business laptops are built to survive.  They aren't flashy, they are built for a job, that they have to do, and they're workhorses - yeah, you'll often miss out on flashy features, or showstopping performance numbers, but you'll still be able to use them 10+ years down the line.  Also, because they're usually bought in high numbers by businesses, they can be found on the secondhand market with usually light use.  That being said, for your gen-AI tasks, i'd probably steer you towards a desktop, if you are looking to do anything that isn't cloud based - the recommended system hardware requirments for \"Local AI\" get moved with every generation.  If you just want to be able to ChatGPT stuff, then any laptop will do, but for running local models, if you want them to be of any long term use, you'll need to keep your local hardware up to date - and depending on your usage, you'll need a lot more storage flexibility than the average 2025 ultrabook offers - a desktop is only one newegg visit, and a couple of screwdriver spins away from more storage/ram, as your needs grow.",

Problems range from constant minor repairs to wide-spread, full-blown engine deaths across Europe. (If you don't believe me look up Puretech scandal).\n\nPlease investigate car concerns thoroughly before deciding they are generic so your car doesn't become a black hole in your bank account.\n\nLaptops too. I know my Victus is notorious for hinge issues so I take care and I open it carefully. No problems so far. But some things should not be bought.",

Excel is not the right tool for the job, because it has rounding errors.  Please please please do not use financial data in Excel unless rounding errors are not going to be an issue.

I know many people with macs and their durability is fantastic, must have had experience with 100’s of macs over the years.. many are still going strong 10 years later, if you demonstrate a manufacturing issue causing a problem you will get a replacement. Apple laptops as a new platform are complex with a system on a chip design at least 5 years ahead of everyone else, this means you can’t just wade in like a bull in a china shop to fix them yourself as easily. But that’s why you have the best repair support in the industry by visiting your local Apple Store. Apple’s advanced on dye unified memory system can’t be compared to a cheap stick of ram from your local computer emporium. You are not comparing like with like..
