  "Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024) vs Lenovo ThinkPad P1 I've narrowed my search down to 2 laptops and can't decide which to go with. Which would you recommend?\n\n**Use:** I would mainly use the laptop for data science coursework and occasional gaming (MS Flight Simulator, FIFA, GTA). I want the laptop to last at least 5-6 years.\n\n**Price:** Price is not a factor since I'm not paying for it.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n|-|Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024)|Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 6|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|CPU|Ultra 9 185H|i9-13900H|\n|GPU|RTX 4090|RTX 4090|\n|TGP|115W|105W|\n|RAM|32 GB|32 GB|\n|SSD|2 TB|1 TB|\n|Display|2560x1600 240Hz OLED|2560x1600 165 Hz IPS|\n|Battery|90 Whr|90 Whr|\n|Power|240 W|230 W|\n|Dimensions (cm)|35.4 x 24.6 x 1.74|35.95 x 25.38 x 1.75|\n\nBoth have vapor chamber cooling. I like that the ThinkPad doesn't look like a gaming laptop and has lots of reviews, whereas the Asus is brand new. ThinkPads are also known for their reliability.\n\nI like that the Asus is slightly smaller, has a higher TGP, an OLED display, slightly better CPU, and a higher refresh rate.",
  "Despite similar specs, the two target very different audiences.  If your priority is gaming, the G16 should get you better graphics performance and will have the better screen (although both will have excellent screens), better speakers, and also include a lot of tuning software allowing you to adjust power limits, fan curves, keyboard lighting, etc.  You will also benefit from a large online gaming community with loads of tips on how to optimize your computer/gaming settings.  If you use the laptop professionally and care about a clean/muted look, best-in-class keyboard, Thinkpad support, then go with the Thinkpad.  I, for one, love the Thinkpad Trackpoint (red nub) so will always go with the P1 if the specs are the same.  But it is getting tougher and tougher to choose as Asus has really done a good job making the ROG Zephyrus line pretty clean and sleek.",
  "+1 for Zephyrus, but consider where you’re buying it from. \n\nI love ASUS laptops/products but their support can sometimes be lacking. If you’re in the US, get it from a reliable 3rd party reseller like Bestbuy, MicroCenter, etc.",
  "Thinkpad or Zephyrus My current laptop (Surface Book 2 13.5) is still doing quite well but I'm looking to upgrade, mostly because of performance restraints and reliance on cloud for ML tasks. I work with applied AI but all the tooling I need from work is provided, but I want to have more power for my tinkering outside of work.\n\nI have narrowed it down to 2 options: The Lenovo Thinkpad P1 Gen 7 or the Asus Zephyrus G16\n\n\n\nThe Thinkpad is on sale for £1800 with the following specs:\n\nIntel® Core™ Ultra 7 165H vPro® Processor\n\n4060 8Gb 60W\n\n32Gb (upgradable, but expensive to do so)\n\n1Tb\n\n16\" 3840x2400 IPS 60Hz\n\n\n\nAnd the Zephyrus G16 is more modern and also not on sale (\\~£2650) with the following specs:\n\nIntel® Core™ Ultra 9 Processor 285H\n\n5070ti 12Gb 120(?)W\n\n32Gb (soldered)\n\n1Tb\n\n16\" 2560 x 1600 OLED 240Hz\n\n\n\nMy usage consists of the following:\n\nMy laptop goes about 13 hours between long charges, with 4-6 of those being light usage (coding/web browsing/reading and highlighting academic papers) and the rest is just idle with screen off and shut. I can charge it with a very low wattage USB-C connection when out. When I'm at home and I have the main charger I will often be hooked up via USB-C to an external monitor, I'll do more coding and web browsing but I'll also be running ML models (mostly Graph Neural Networks and Multi Agent RL - not LLMs). I also don't train locally, but having the ability to prototype small models before I send it up to the cloud and leave it to train would be useful. I do also want to perform data processing with pandas locally. Aside from that whilst I do game it's only League of Legends/Minecraft so I don't need to worry about running AAA games. I'm looking to use this laptop for the next 5+ years so having longevity in mind is important, although if the Thinkpad becomes outclassed because it is cheaper I'd be okay with upgrading earlier.\n\nI haven't been able to see either of them in person to get a feel for them, and I can't decide off of specs and reviews alone, so hoping I can get some help deciding. \n\nOne final and somewhat important point is I am British, I prefer the English UK ISO layout - which means a big enter key, if that is or isn't possible on the laptop that does have some sway in my decision.\n\nI am also somewhat open to suggestions. I have also considered:\n\n\\- MacBook Pro - but I need windows/WSL and x86 (as well as NVIDIA for local CUDA)\n\n\\- Framework 16 - I don't think the 16 system is mature enough yet, especially for the cost",
  "Consider the Thinkpad T1G? It's the version of this year's P1 (Gen 8) with gaming (RTX 5060/5070) graphics cards. Best of both worlds? Unsure how pricing is over the pond.",
  "Laptop for Mechanical Engineering Student? I am currently in my first year as an Engineering student, planning to go into Mechanical next year. I am currently using a crusty old chromebook from high school, and I am wondering if any of you have recommendations as to what laptop I should get to run CAD and other design software? I am currently thinking of getting the Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 6, as it is on sale in Canada for around $1900 CAD, but I'm not too sure about it because I have heard about how it has poor battery life. I also know very little about computers so any tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q1in7obg1xwf1.png?width=1323&format=png&auto=webp&s=9336e19881b51627a01c6acb2d5cdf70dc087c8e",
  "Windows laptop for software developer - Dell XPS 15 or HP ZBook Studio G9 (lower price for same spec) Shopping for new laptop.\n\n* Primary use case is sw development on windows. No gaming/CAD/video. Need high CPU perf and lots of RAM, and I choose hot&silent over cool&loud, battery life is not super high priority.\n* Display 14-16'' 16:10 IPS matte\n* Weight under 2kg (4.4lbs) as I need to travel with it almost daily, thinness does not matter that much\n* 32GB RAM (ideally extensible to 64GB), keyboard without numpad, \"office look\", Intel based system preferred because of thunderbolt 4\n\nSo far, I found these two laptops and specs that match most of my criteria:\n\n* **15'' Dell XPS 9520 (precision 5570 is basically the same but with higher prices)**\n   * i7-12700H/FHD+/32GB/1TB SSD/RTX3050Ti for 2780 EUR (weight \\~1.92kg)\n   * 4K or 3.5K OLED screen with same spec for 3020 EUR, but those are glossy screens and I am super afraid of annoying reflections as I always had matte displays and was super happy with them\n* **16'' HP ZBook Studio G9 (slightly lighter but bigger dimensions than dell xps 15)**\n   * i7-12700H/FHD+/32GB/1TB SSD/RTX3050Ti for 2470 EUR (weight \\~1.75kg)\n   * i7-12700H/FHD+/32GB/1TB SSD/RTX3060 (vapor chamber cooling) for 2600 EUR\n   * i7-12700H/UHD+(matte)/32GB/1TB SSD/RTXA2000 for 3000 EUR - this one has gorgeous matte display\n* 16'' Lenovo X1 Extreme Gen 5 (or P1 G5) also matches my criteria but unfortunately not available in my country with reasonable specs and prices..\n\nI like the design of both, no clear winner for me. HP ZBook Studio G9 seems like the better deal, but there are not enough reviews so far. The only detailed one is on [notebookcheck.net](https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-ZBook-Studio-16-G9-laptop-review-Workstation-with-120-Hz-DreamColor-display.667804.0.html), and ZBook delivered excellent benchmark scores, but review also mentions high fan noise in light/avg load which would be no-go for me.  **I am wondering if the spec with RTX 3060 that has vapor chamber cooling translates to lower fans RPM and thus lower noise? Any experience or thoughts?** For Dell XPS 15 there are also reports of high fan noise in lighter load, but it seems to me that most people report that it is one of the most silent laptops in this category. Btw. I understand 12700H in these medium sized chassis would be thermal throttled, but I assume perf will still be better than P-series processors in business-oriented laptops (thinkpads, carbons, lattitudes etc). Would appreciate your thoughts or suggestion of alternatives. Thanks for your help!",

  "Thanks. P series or X1 extreme were on my list, but there are very limited options/configs of these in my country and comparable specs to hp/dell are for much higher prices (think 500 eur more).",
  "Please HELP ME. NEED A NEW LAPTOP I need a new computer. Please help\n\nHello, this is my first ever post but I can here because I know you all are honest and helpful. 2 days ago I spilled water on my Lenovo yoga 920. It was so sad. Tried the rice, took it to geek squad and Best Buy, couldn’t be saved. \n\nI’m a second year mechanical engineering student who likes to play games occasionally, and I’m in need of a new computer, ideally under $3000. I run CAD, Solid works, and MATHLAB and I want something that is going to last me. I do take care of my things so I know it won’t break down [stupid spill :(]\n\nANYWAYS , I was looking at the THINKPAD p1 Gen 2 and I ended up customizing its got everything a engineering student needs. With discounts and everything it went from $4,249 to $2,421.93. I think this is an absolute steal and I should take advantage, but i need some input. I’ve been looking at reviews and I’m trying to find the best and a reasonable price. Is the thinkpad p1 Gen 2 a good laptop, or is there another one I should consider? What about the Lenovo THINKPAD P73? I love this one as well and the size is perfect. 17.3 inches!!! And I also customized and got it down to about $2,200 and it was at $4,500....I’m not only sticking to Lenovo I just need help. Any other input would be nice. Thank you very much!",
  "Guys is this genuine? Like seriously 1 rupees? ",
  "likely a phishing page, open a new tab type \"store.lenovo.com\" manually and make sure it's still in your cart there",
  "Proceed with caution. For that price, I'd say to just go ahead and buy it and see what happens, considering you're on [store.lenovo.com](http://store.lenovo.com), but I'm still very suspicious about it. There's no reason they'd actually sell anything for that price, unless it was a mistake on the website. However, if it is a mistake and it lets you place the order, it's possible that they might still honor the purchase and just eat the loss as a result of their mistake and still send it to you. It looks like the actual Lenovo website. Look closely at the URL, and type in the Lenovo website URL manually and navigate there directly to make sure you're at the right place. If you still see it there, maybe try and see if it lets you order.",

Yet - the company has all rights to cancel an order at anytime and refund you the money. \n\n  \nI'd go for it and see what happens if I were you, no harm in losing a rupee.

I only learned this after a month of waiting for it to arrive and it being in the ready to ship stage, still showing that they had stock. When the error was discovered they offered to cancel my order and find a machine that “fit” my needs at whatever price they were selling it at. No, I wanted a machine with the closest specifications at the price that I ordered and paid for the first one that you said you had in stock. They didn’t budge at all.

  "Most likely true. I work at a very large company and work in picking and shipping orders, and it's generally the same for every company. If a product is in stock and is purchased, the order is automatically added to the queue and dropped in the next wave of orders for the warehouse workers to pick and ship it. \n\nMany times the packlist/order receipt will show the total price of the order, but nobody really pays attention and even if a warehouse grunt sees it, they will assume nothing and still send it out. No managers or financial workers will see the order until well after it is shipped and delivered in most cases",
  "I have worked at a popular grocery store for over a decade. In the U.S. if a store has a price sign in front of a product that indicates an incorrect price, we have to honor it. Otherwise it’s called bait and switch. I have no idea how this is handled online or internationally however.",
  "They don’t. Law undergraduate here. This falls under contract law. A website listing or product is considered as an **invitation to treat**, and not an **offer**. To define an offer, I will quote it from the case of Preston Corpn Sdn Bhd v Edward Leong: An offer is an intimation of willingness by an offeror to enter into a legally binding contract. Its terms either expressly or impliedly must **indicate** that it is to **become binding on the offeror** (buyer) assoon as it has been **accepted by the offeree** (seller).\n\nEven if the customer were to send an offer (by checking out), a **binding contract** is not yet formed because Lenovo has yet to accept that offer and they can choose to back out as there is no **legally enforceable agreement** yet. (A confirmation email is also not signifying of acceptance of order!)\n\nA similar example to this would be Chwee Kin Keong v Digiland Mall Pte Ltd. TLDR is that an employee keyed in a pricing for a product at $66 instead of $3,854 (MSRP) and the company obviously didn’t want to fulfil orders that were made and got taken to court. Court ruled in the company’s favour.\n\nIn consumer court, courts do consistently rule in favour of the seller during obvious pricing mistakes like a $1 phone etc. because they take the view of a **reasonable person in consideration and apply the objectivity test**. \n\nFor example, in this case, the court said:\n“I find ... that the plaintiffs, given each of their backgrounds, would in any event, each have separately realised and appreciated, before placing their purchase orders,that a manifest mistake had occurred – even if no communications on the error had taken place between them. Further, the character of the mistake was such that **any reasonable person** similarly circumstanced as each of the plaintiffs would have had every reason to believe that a manifest error had occurred.” . \n\nOtherwise, the court would also simply treat it as a **clerical or unilateral mistake** and not punish the seller. Similarly in this case, Lenovo would win.\n\nIf there’s any Law graduates reading this and want to improve on my stand, please do! I’m still studying and open to improvement",
  "Nope where it's clearly a mistake and you know it, they don't need to honour it",
  "They are not and three seconds of googling will support that. Just because you once managed to slip one through doesn’t mean that’s the law.\n\nImagine a computer store mislabelling a €4000 laptop at €1 and a large amount of units are ordered overnight while nobody’s at work. Your argument is that EU law now effectively forces this company into bankruptcy by being required to honor these sales that were clearly made exploiting an error in pricing?",
  "No....",
  "Depends on the Ts and Cs",

  "True, but I was just giving an example to explain. However, if we look at it in layman terms, the universal legal principle will be the same. You simply cannot reasonably expect to enforce a contract based on a price that is **obviously an error**. So in any jurisdiction, I’m highly confident that Lenovo would win should this be taken to court. \n\nIf you search up similar topics, you will find that across common law (Singapore, UK, US) and civil law (France, Germany, EU), the courts follow the same reasoning:\n1.\tObvious pricing errors = no binding contract.\n2.\tBuyers cannot exploit a mistake they recognize.\n3.\tThe worst that happens to the retailer is refunding the money.\n\nHowever, if we are referring to say, a $599 MSRP laptop being listed erroneously at $499, the court may order the seller to honor some of the orders, which has happened in many jurisdictions before, since borderline errors (e.g., 10–25% off normal price) can be interpreted as a discount/promotion and would lead a reasonable person to believe that there is no mistake in pricing.\n\nIn this case though, it’s a laptop for $1. So it’s pretty obvious and no court would side with the buyer.",
  "Incorrect.\nTL;DR Lenovo (and most other companies) explicitly states that a confirmation email does **NOT** signify acceptance of the order. **No acceptance = No contract.** (This clause is commonplace for every business) Consumer will lose if he tries to go to court, even if he has the best lawyer. Below, I will cite Lenovo.\n\n**Full explanation:**\n\nA confirmation email, if you dig deep into any businesses’s Terms and Conditions (the thing that everyone ignores), has built in protective clauses in their Terms of Sale, and they’re not obliged to provide the consumer with any goods or service with a confirmation email alone. **Confirmation email ≠ acceptance.** A confirmation email only signifies that they have **received** the order.\n\nHere, I will specifically cite for this case, Lenovo. Under their T&Cs, it clearly states that **a confirmation of Lenovo receiving and/or processing your order does not constitute acceptance of the order.** (1.2)\n\nSource: https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/legal/new-products-and-warranty-services/?srsltid=AfmBOop9YcXqtlgbWWSEtLd4WCy7paTFtCMABKIs8xZmfYyPvIBRyTbc&ut\n\nIt also states under 1.1 that:\n\n1.1) **No contract** for the purchase of Products or Services will be formed until Lenovo accepts your Order by **one of the following**:\n\n**(a)** shipping the hardware Product and sending you a shipment confirmation email; or\n\n**(b)** making the software Product available to you; or\n\n**(c)** providing the Service to you.\n\nTherefore, that confirmation email is **not a binding acceptance** and is more of an acknowledgment that they’ve received your order and are processing it. Until shipping occurs (or software is delivered, etc.), Lenovo **reserves the right** to cancel or adjust your order **even if** you’ve already received a confirmation email or any other form of confirmation.\n\nI personally think that TV shows these days make the law seem very shallow to the average person, like; “Little guy sues company and wins!”. \n\nThe reality is, that every business has multiple built in protective and failsafe clauses layered into their contracts etc. to make sure that real consumers **will never win against them** in court. I feel like the average person should read more into the T&Cs so they know what they’re getting themselves into, but we don’t, so companies take advantage of that; and that is why we have lawyers :)",
  "Do enlighten me. 99% of companies in the EU are labeled “micro scale”. And also, way to deflect from the question about legislation ;)\n\n“A couple ten thousand dollars” in this case would be 5-10 laptops sold at the wrong price. You can see from this topic that ppl flock to these things like moths to a flame.\n\nMy most commonly used online computer store typically has a stock of about 50 of each gaming laptop, do the math on a say 5 of those products being mislabeled overnight and each those selling out at a €3999 discount. That’s about a million euro lost on a clear database error. “Just suck it up, it’s the law”, yeah not so much bro.",

  "Old ones okay maybe if decently priced. Problem are new ones, being super overpriced while offering very little. An example : A mid range T14 G5 with a core ultra 5 125U, 60hz 1200p sRGB IPS display, 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage, which for those two are getting below today's standard, is priced at 1200€. Those are specs you'd find on a 600-700€ laptop, not a 1200€ laptop. At 1000€ you can already get something well built with a Ryzen 7 8th gen, 32gb of ram and 1tb of storage (Asus Zenbook, HP Elitebook, etc). In this case that laptop OP showed was a pretty fine deal, but if you took a Thinkpad for the same price you'd have an E14 Gen 6 with even worse specs.

I do a fair amount of engineering projects (3D modelling, simulations) and video editing.\n\nI've been waiting over half a year now for the new ThinkPad P1 gen 8 and its RTX 50 version (T1g), but recently Asus unveiled an RX 50 version of their ProArt 16, which now comes with a 120Hz tandem OLED 1000 nits display. It seems to have a much higher TDP of 120W, compared to the T1g of 60-75W.

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "LOCKED BIOS - Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE) I bought a Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE) at an auction. The BIOS/UEFI is locked with a Supervisor Password. A repair shop reflashed both EEPROMs from scratch (64 MB BIOS REGION and 16 MB ME REGION), but the password remained. They concluded the password resides in the MEC1723N EC, which isn’t rewritable with conventional bench tools and also has epoxy underneath, making replacement difficult. I’m trying to contact the original company to have it cleared officially.\n\n**Device**  \nModel: ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (Intel), Type 21HE\n\n**Repair shop’s assessment**\n\n* From their investigation (including reading and analyzing the extracted hex), they did not find any sector in the EEPROMs where the password might be stored.\n* Conclusion from their studies: on some T14 units, the Supervisor Password is stored in the **Embedded Controller (EC)**, specifically the **MEC1723N**.\n\n**Practical issues:**\n\n* The MEC1723N would have internal firmware with no known method for reflashing using standard bench tools;\n* Lenovo uses black resin/epoxy under the chip, making desoldering/replacement almost unfeasible;\n* Even swapping in a “blank” chip would require the proper EC firmware, which the shop does not have.\n\n**Technical confirmation:**\n\n* On a **ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE)** with **MEC1723N**, does the **Supervisor Password** indeed reside in the EC?\n* Has anyone here successfully **reprogrammed or replaced a MEC1723N** (preserving firmware integrity), or can confirm that it cannot be done without Lenovo’s proprietary resources/firmware?\n\n**Legitimate paths:**\n\n* Beyond **system board replacement** and the **official process via the previous owning company**, is there any **authorized route** (e.g., **Lenovo Authorized Service Centers**) that can **reflash/synchronize the EC** to clear the SVP?\n\nThank you.",

  "Lenovo Thinkpad E14 gen 7? Hi, I'm a CS student planning to take C#, Deep Learning and ML courses running on the cloud, so I don’t need high local performance. I'm considering the ThinkPad E14 Gen 7 with Intel Core 3 100U.\n\nI'm interested in the 64Wh battery and 12W TDP CPUs. Main use: coding and web. Priorities: 16:10, long battery, 14\" size, I plan to upgrade RAM and NVMe later.\n\nCurrent devices:\nIdeaPad 320 (AMD A12, 8GB)\nIdeaPad 330 (i7-8550U, 12GB, unstable)\nDesktop (MB Z370, i5-8500, 24GB, GTX 1060)\n\n1. Is the 1920×1200 45% NTSC screen enough, or should I get the 2.8K sRGB 100% (+70€) for general usage? \n\n2. Will the Core 3 100U hold up 5 years or become obsolete soon? \n\n3. Is the 225U worth the extra cost (~+250€)? \n\nAny owners of this \"cheap\" Thinkpad?\n\n4. Any good alternatives with like 8W TDP with at least 64Wh battery under 600€ :)?\n\n5. Also, very high IQ question:\n~MacBook Air M4 13.6\" (10/8 core 16/256GB) at €190.80/month for 5 months,\nor\n~ThinkPad 100U (8/256GB, base screen) at €173/month for 3 months,\nor\n~ThinkPad 225U (8/256GB, base screen) at €244/month for 3 months?\n\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1mk7rd2)",
  "If you want long battery life, and don't want to pay insane Mac prices, get a HP Omnibook X or I think ASUS also had an ARM laptop on the cheaper side.\n\n15h battery life, feels quite like a Mac, but it is ARM so you should make sure your software will run on it. Of course, this would go for the Mac too.",
  "Thanks! I had thought about it, but not knowing the programs I will need in the future, I feel more confident sticking to the most widely used ones. If something is not supported, I will have to bring my old laptop (the stable one)😂",

  "Dell Inspiron 16 5645 vs Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 6 vs P14s Gen 3 vs Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 16 Gen 10 vs Acer Aspire 15 A15-41M Hi guys. I am stuck on choosing a laptop for home use (it will rarely be used outside). I need a good laptop with some power, but not noisy and cool. I am not interested in games, maybe ELDEN RING sometimes. The display is not so important, since it will be connected to an external monitor. Choose between the following options:\n\n\n\n1. Dell Inspiron 16 5645 - 16\" (1980x1200) Touch IPS 100% sRGB / Ryzen 7 8840U / 32Gb DDR5/ 1 TB SSD - 1 month warranty - $620\n\n\n\n2. Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 6 - 14\" (1920x1200), 45% NTSC / Ryzen 7 PRO 7735U / 16GB (1 of 2 slots) DDR5 / 512GB SSD - 1 month warranty - $630\n\n\n\n3. Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 3 - 14\" (1920x1200), 45% NTSC / Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U / 32GB (LDDR5-6400) / 512GB SSD - 1 month warranty - $650\n\n\n\n4. Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 16 Gen 10 - 16\" (1980x1200), 45% NTSC / AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS / 16GB (2 of 2 slots) DDR5 / 512GB SSD - 1 year warranty - $650\n\n\n\n5. Acer Aspire 15 A15-41M - 15.6 \" (1920x1080), 45% NTSC / Ryzen 7 8840HS / 16GB (1 slot soldered to 8 GB + 1 SO-DIMM 8 GB) DDR5 / 512GB SSD - 1 year warranty - $580\n\n\n\nI will be glad to any opinion. Thank you",
