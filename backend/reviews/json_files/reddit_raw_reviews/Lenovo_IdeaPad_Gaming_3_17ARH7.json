  "First of all, I hope you're doing okay - with the hangover and in general. \n\nTo clean this, you'll want to make sure the laptop is powered off and unplugged. Then, grab some isopropyl alcohol. Do not dilute it with water - we want to avoid any more moisture than is necessary. Use an old toothbrush (better yet, a new 99c throwaway brush from your local supermarket) and dip it in the alcohol. Use the toothbrush to clean the tops of the keys, and in between the keys as best you can. \n\nTo get underneath the keys, you may be able to GENTLY tug on them and lift them from their hinges. Be careful not to snap or break anything, as you'd have a whole new set of problems. For more details, you may want to consult an owner's manual (try looking it up online, just by searching your laptop model).\n\nI hope this helps. Best of luck!",

Take out your battery and your cmos battery, constantly press the power button to drain any remaining power from the motherboards resistors.\n\nThen, while its taken apart(depending on if your keyboard can come out easily without unmounting the motherboard, which mine didnt) spray it with room temp water for a bit, let it drain out, place it somewhere warm and dry for 24 hours and let it dry out.\n\nPut it all back together and should be just like new. \n\nI was skeptical too, but i did it, on the deal that my father would buy me a brand new one if it didnt work.",

It's not necessarily HARD but let me guide you through the broad strokes.   \n\n\nFirst - turn the fucking thing off and get the bottom off, disconnect the battery ASAP. Not joking. Get it off power asap as any conductive liquids are burning up traces and causing rapid oxidation of everything in there.   \n\n\nGo to ifixit, find your model, and start disassembling. Make sure you have the correct drivers to get all of the various screws out.   \n\n\nTake pictures of your progress if you've never disassembled something. Having a magnetic pad to place the screws on and label them is a godsend for this kind of thing.   \n\n\nAnticipate replacing the \"top plate w/keys\". That's the part you're looking for there.

Dump the nasty ISO and fill with fresh clean batch. Rinse and repeat until the alcohol runs clear. You’re gonna probably need a few jugs of iso so don’t think this is gonna be cheap. I once did an experiment as a kid running an old motherboard multiple times in a bin submerged first alcohol, then oil, then water.

  "Sounds like my moms house! Had to go back for a year last year because of unfortunate circumstances. I’m just getting over the sick after 3 months of being out. $400k house in a pretty decent neighborhood, infested with roaches and termites, covered head to toe in trash and unused furniture that “will have a place soon.” Roughly 10 months ago I fell through the floor of my (autistic and epileptic) younger brothers room. I was ok because I just fell into the foundation so it’s not like I fell through a floor like what you see on tv lol. It’s a miracle he didn’t have a seizure in there before then. They still haven’t brought anybody in to inspect the beam in the foundation because they can’t get the place clean. Not even the front end of the house where the room is located!! They can’t clean 3 rooms a bathroom and a hallway and keep it clean for a week so they can bring the inspector in; the inspector who will tell them weather or not the house is even safe to keep living in. She’s had roaches since ‘09 since we moved to this state. We started in an apartment with them then they came with us to the house. She’s tried “everything” except throwing away all the trash, ridding of books that haven’t seen the light of day in YEARS (she’s a teacher so she “needs all of the books she has” but probably has hundreds of thousands of books laying around, all of which getting more and more caked in roach gross over the years), she hasn’t ever tried bringing in a pro cleaner; not that I want to subject anybody to that hellscape, but she has horrible asthma and other disabilities that prevent her from cleaning in that house for long, the house gave me chronic bronchitis and I also have a muscle related condition (muscle spasms, joints buckling under normal weight, dislocations, subluxations, easy to accidentally overstrain a muscle doing nothing) that prevents me from working there long as well, my dad is a disabled military vet and my 2 youngest sisters have dropped out of school to be chronically online Roblox/Minecraft/genshin assholes who can’t even be bothered to wash their own dishes. My brother is the cleanest one of them, I’ve never seen his room unclean. All of us who have lived in that house for years have been sick for years. So over the last nearly 15 years it’s just gotten worse and worse and worse over there with no help and no light at the end of the tunnel. Oh did I mention she has 11 cats and 1 dog and 1 puppy? 3 of the cats are mine and I’m rescuing them from her soon, but I can’t take them all and I can’t call animal control because she has threatened to blackmail me if I do, telling me she knows she is doing wrong. To get AC to take it seriously I’d need to tell them details only I’d know and my mom has threatened me, my friends and friends family with blackmail should anybody report her. She has also been lying to the county school district and has been submitting fake school work in my sisters name to keep her “homeschool” status clear but my sister (dropped out 9th grade would be 11th grade now) doesn’t do the work. 90% of the time it’s my mom using some of her students work and editing my sisters name on it. My sister gets to do jack all and has to watch a Kahn academy video like once a month when my mom remembers to tell her to. I know this because I also dropped out (but did it right and got into alt school within a couple of months) and she tried to do it to me and I said hell no I’m not letting you do that I’ll do my own work. My sister desperately needs therapy because she has such bad anxiety she refuses to leave the house because she is afraid everybody is looking at her and judging her or making fun of her. That’s why she stopped going to school too, because she for some reason was always late to class and when she was late to class everyone would turn and look at her when she walked in. It’s horrible but my mom coddles her and tells her it’s ok and “she’ll figure it out.” Terrible really. It really is the upper middle class-holes that live like this….(not all of em ofc but ya get the point)\n\nMy sisters once broke both of their laptops by dropping them. My mom tried to take it to geek squad, but I said no there is probably roaches inside so lemme look cuz I’m a little tech savvy. Turns out they didn’t break them but actually there was so many roaches in it that the fan couldn’t turn so they were overheating, they both just happened to had dropped theirs recent to that and thought they broke it. It’s horrible how unfortunately normal all this crap is. Also can definitely say I will forever know if someone has roaches because the smell is excruciatingly distinct and makes me sick.",

Trash that's been piling up for months, with bugs everywhere.  So many dishes piled up that you can't even tell where the sink is, despite a dishwasher being right there.  Dirty laundry...EVERYWHERE.  Furniture cloth looks like a civil war bandage.  Carpet that looks like it hasn't been cleaned since the Nixon administration, despite the house only being 5 years old.  \n\nYou can smell the BO on these people from 20 feet away, like they haven't seen the wet end of a bathroom in years, and the smell lingers in your own clothes after they leave.  If you're unfortunate enough to have gotten a truck with cloth seats, it permeates those too, and it seems like no amount of Febreeze in the world will get it out.  \n\nAnd the worst part about it?

  "They didn’t honour their error in my experience. I purchased a machine on a fantastic sale. The website said that they had it in stock. They in fact did not have it in stock. I only learned this after a month of waiting for it to arrive and it being in the ready to ship stage, still showing that they had stock. When the error was discovered they offered to cancel my order and find a machine that “fit” my needs at whatever price they were selling it at. No, I wanted a machine with the closest specifications at the price that I ordered and paid for the first one that you said you had in stock. They didn’t budge at all. I ordered a machine at $250, the next one that had the closest specifications was $750. The original price of the machine I ordered was $950.

  "Yea, like my dad saw a wrong price on jbls site, 0 euro soundbar, and he ordered one, but then he ordered 15 more. Im pretty sure thats the reason that they catched it. A while ago i saw a wrong price on jbls site, 25 euros for a flip 4 camo. I ordered one and actually recieved it",
  "Most likely true. I work at a very large company and work in picking and shipping orders, and it's generally the same for every company. If a product is in stock and is purchased, the order is automatically added to the queue and dropped in the next wave of orders for the warehouse workers to pick and ship it. \n\nMany times the packlist/order receipt will show the total price of the order, but nobody really pays attention and even if a warehouse grunt sees it, they will assume nothing and still send it out. No managers or financial workers will see the order until well after it is shipped and delivered in most cases",
  "I have worked at a popular grocery store for over a decade. In the U.S. if a store has a price sign in front of a product that indicates an incorrect price, we have to honor it. Otherwise it’s called bait and switch. I have no idea how this is handled online or internationally however.",
  "They don’t. Law undergraduate here. This falls under contract law. A website listing or product is considered as an **invitation to treat**, and not an **offer**. To define an offer, I will quote it from the case of Preston Corpn Sdn Bhd v Edward Leong: An offer is an intimation of willingness by an offeror to enter into a legally binding contract. Its terms either expressly or impliedly must **indicate** that it is to **become binding on the offeror** (buyer) assoon as it has been **accepted by the offeree** (seller).\n\nEven if the customer were to send an offer (by checking out), a **binding contract** is not yet formed because Lenovo has yet to accept that offer and they can choose to back out as there is no **legally enforceable agreement** yet. (A confirmation email is also not signifying of acceptance of order!)\n\nA similar example to this would be Chwee Kin Keong v Digiland Mall Pte Ltd. TLDR is that an employee keyed in a pricing for a product at $66 instead of $3,854 (MSRP) and the company obviously didn’t want to fulfil orders that were made and got taken to court. Court ruled in the company’s favour.\n\nIn consumer court, courts do consistently rule in favour of the seller during obvious pricing mistakes like a $1 phone etc. because they take the view of a **reasonable person in consideration and apply the objectivity test**. \n\nFor example, in this case, the court said:\n“I find ... that the plaintiffs, given each of their backgrounds, would in any event, each have separately realised and appreciated, before placing their purchase orders,that a manifest mistake had occurred – even if no communications on the error had taken place between them. Further, the character of the mistake was such that **any reasonable person** similarly circumstanced as each of the plaintiffs would have had every reason to believe that a manifest error had occurred.” . \n\nOtherwise, the court would also simply treat it as a **clerical or unilateral mistake** and not punish the seller. Similarly in this case, Lenovo would win.\n\nIf there’s any Law graduates reading this and want to improve on my stand, please do! I’m still studying and open to improvement",
  "Nope where it's clearly a mistake and you know it, they don't need to honour it",
  "They are not and three seconds of googling will support that. Just because you once managed to slip one through doesn’t mean that’s the law.\n\nImagine a computer store mislabelling a €4000 laptop at €1 and a large amount of units are ordered overnight while nobody’s at work. Your argument is that EU law now effectively forces this company into bankruptcy by being required to honor these sales that were clearly made exploiting an error in pricing?",
  "No....",
  "Depends on the Ts and Cs",
  "Yeah.... depends on if that's enforceable to a website in another country.... Much like the GDPR fines the EU charges.... a US website isn't subject to that....  even if they decide to keep data on you... because they're not breaking THEIR laws.",

  "True, but I was just giving an example to explain. However, if we look at it in layman terms, the universal legal principle will be the same. You simply cannot reasonably expect to enforce a contract based on a price that is **obviously an error**. So in any jurisdiction, I’m highly confident that Lenovo would win should this be taken to court. \n\nIf you search up similar topics, you will find that across common law (Singapore, UK, US) and civil law (France, Germany, EU), the courts follow the same reasoning:\n1.\tObvious pricing errors = no binding contract.\n2.\tBuyers cannot exploit a mistake they recognize.\n3.\tThe worst that happens to the retailer is refunding the money.\n\nHowever, if we are referring to say, a $599 MSRP laptop being listed erroneously at $499, the court may order the seller to honor some of the orders, which has happened in many jurisdictions before, since borderline errors (e.g., 10–25% off normal price) can be interpreted as a discount/promotion and would lead a reasonable person to believe that there is no mistake in pricing.\n\nIn this case though, it’s a laptop for $1. So it’s pretty obvious and no court would side with the buyer.",
  "Incorrect.\nTL;DR Lenovo (and most other companies) explicitly states that a confirmation email does **NOT** signify acceptance of the order. **No acceptance = No contract.** (This clause is commonplace for every business) Consumer will lose if he tries to go to court, even if he has the best lawyer. Below, I will cite Lenovo.\n\n**Full explanation:**\n\nA confirmation email, if you dig deep into any businesses’s Terms and Conditions (the thing that everyone ignores), has built in protective clauses in their Terms of Sale, and they’re not obliged to provide the consumer with any goods or service with a confirmation email alone. **Confirmation email ≠ acceptance.** A confirmation email only signifies that they have **received** the order.\n\nHere, I will specifically cite for this case, Lenovo. Under their T&Cs, it clearly states that **a confirmation of Lenovo receiving and/or processing your order does not constitute acceptance of the order.** (1.2)\n\nSource: https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/legal/new-products-and-warranty-services/?srsltid=AfmBOop9YcXqtlgbWWSEtLd4WCy7paTFtCMABKIs8xZmfYyPvIBRyTbc&ut\n\nIt also states under 1.1 that:\n\n1.1) **No contract** for the purchase of Products or Services will be formed until Lenovo accepts your Order by **one of the following**:\n\n**(a)** shipping the hardware Product and sending you a shipment confirmation email; or\n\n**(b)** making the software Product available to you; or\n\n**(c)** providing the Service to you.\n\nTherefore, that confirmation email is **not a binding acceptance** and is more of an acknowledgment that they’ve received your order and are processing it. Until shipping occurs (or software is delivered, etc.), Lenovo **reserves the right** to cancel or adjust your order **even if** you’ve already received a confirmation email or any other form of confirmation.\n\nI personally think that TV shows these days make the law seem very shallow to the average person, like; “Little guy sues company and wins!”. \n\nThe reality is, that every business has multiple built in protective and failsafe clauses layered into their contracts etc. to make sure that real consumers **will never win against them** in court. I feel like the average person should read more into the T&Cs so they know what they’re getting themselves into, but we don’t, so companies take advantage of that; and that is why we have lawyers :)",

And also, way to deflect from the question about legislation ;)\n\n“A couple ten thousand dollars” in this case would be 5-10 laptops sold at the wrong price.

Play around with the resolution and get a balance of visual quality and fps (960p is usually a great balance of both)\n3.

  "GTA V is one of those games that didn't really ever require a fast PC when new.\n\nYour PC should run it very well actually.\n\n\nI played it on first gen iris graphics (8259u) on a mini PC I bought as a emulator box. It did well even back then",
  "Yes. Not only GTA V. But many other open world games with good graphical quality (I guess Batman: Arkham Knight would be peak)...",
  "Cool mom!",
  "Gta v is incredibly outdated at this point so you could probably run it on a potato. It probably won't run great without a discreet cpu but it should run.",
  "It’s good. If you find yourself running out of storage all the time you can get an extra m.2 SSD",
  "You can but I wouldn’t recommend it, GTAV has been a pain in my ass trying to run it on my laptop which is both new and a beast. Not the laptops fault though, it’s rockstars as far as I know.",
  "It’s by far the worst laptop you can buy for gaming with integrated graphics and a U chip (being power efficient)\n\nThat being said, it does run GTA 5 AND it’s very long battery life allows it to double as a school workstation. I was rocking something similar for 4 years",
  "use geforcenow or any other game streaming no need for gpu...",
  "There was a website called pcbenchmark look up there for any game you wanna install on your laptop",
  "Yes, yes you can",
  "Gta 5 would run fine under medium settings. Intel integrated graphics have come a long way.",
  "Love your mom and respect her as much as possible.\n\n# Paradise lies under the mother’s feet",
  "GTAV was very cpu intensive back in the day. GPU demands start when you start pushing the graphic enhancements. you have integrated graphics, so its you have “the basic”. but it doesnt mean its bad. so dont worry, you have a 13th gen cpu, it will handle it just fine. just start on the lowest settings and start pushing it till you start losing smoothness in the gameplay. have fun!",
  "this is a really nice laptop for school. i would want to have it",
  "It should. A lot of work actually went into making GTA a playable experience on lower-end hardware.\n\nThis one is new enough that the integrated GFX should be able to handle 720p Medium or 1080p Low. I know you can get it running though, because I managed to get it to launch on an i7 4790 from like a decade ago running integrated graphics.\n\nThis will however depend on the thermal solution for this machine. That's where you will likely encounter issues, since it is a slim model. To be fair though, thermal issues aren't uncommon on these types of laptops.\n\nTL;DR: Hardware is adequate enough, cooling may not be. You'll have to test it for yourself to make sure.",
  "I did a ton of gaming on Intel Integrated graphics on my i5-11 laptop CPU. \n\nYou have to play on borderline potato graphics sometimes, but you can get away with a lot of games.",
  "Your mom is so sweet and amazing ❤️",
  "My bro runs bmw on i5-10th gen without gpu on low settings",
  "Yes.",
  "The mother of the son was very kind",
  "What you could've done is type \"i5-13420h gaming\" in youtube",
  "Life-affirming comments on this thread. Enjoy your games :)",
  "You can but you won't get good fps. I play the game with a 1650 gtx and an i5 11300H. I get an avg fps of 50-55 in dense regions and around 65 in open regions at high-med settings. Brand new/post servicing, I was getting 65 in dense regions and 75 smth in open regions. These aren't bad scores but you can pretty much guess that if with a dedicated gpu, I am getting average performance, you cannot really expect too much out of an integrated one.  Moreover, it isn't like you'll be servicing your laptop every week. There'll probably be some here telling you not to listen to us. Your choice at the end who you wanna go with.",
  "Even steam decks can easily handle GTA 5, so yes, just play with the settings",
  "You can run it but it will run like sh1t is the honest answer.",
  "What about amd a10-7300",
  "Without a doubt, definitely you can.",
  "If core 2 duo can, then this baby can as well.",
  "Well I played on my Ryzen 3 3200u with 8 GB Ram and HDD. You easily can.",
  "Pawn it for $200, go get ur dick wet and call it a day.",
  "It will run on medium and about 50 fps , but I think its a business type of laptop not suited for full hardcore gaming",
  "Story mode yes",
  "I have a i7 13700H and I can play war thunder at over 90 fps, it will definitely run gta 5, in the low-med settings, but never the less it will run.",
  "Well what’s the GPU? Everything else is fine, but a good nvidia graphics card would be optimal",
  "GTA V runs fine on 13 y.o. CPU and GPU from 2013. This should run great!",
  "it ran on intel hd 4000 graphics for me, thats a 2012 laptop with integrated graphics, it was good enough for my sister to play so itll run just fine for you",
  "I still run it with i3 laptop intel uhd graphics 12 gb ram and no sdd in an hdd. So you definitely can run it.",
  "Probably. You will have to play on all lowest settings, but u might get 40-50fps\n\nIve ran gta 5 on a dell latitude that was an 1.5 inches thick and had a mobile 3rd gen core i7",
  "Gta works easily. Im running gtav on a amd quadcore with 16 gb and a 3 gb radeon 7950. Im sure u will be fine.",
  "yeah probably",
  "Sorry, but how much did you pay?",
  "Yes, probably at low settings",
  "maybe",
  "ya gta 5 runs on just about everything (very well optimized) so your good at low or medium settings, the only thing that's holding you back is lack of gpu.",
  "Probably not well",
  "Probably at 1080p low or somewhere in 900's.",
  "First-hand exp here: I installed GTA V on my 10th gen i5 w/ integrated graphics. It does run okay at low settings. It can get a little choppy at times. I didn't play long since it was more me doing it 'just to see' how it went, so I can't speak for long-term play. But I did play part of the opening mission and it was okay.",
  "Yea",
  "test it and find out the best solution",
  "You could probably run it well at 1280x720.",
  "used to play pretty well on a amd x4 860k and a 750ti. a 13th gen intel CPU will have no trouble (even using integrated graphics.)",
  "You can, just limit to 60 fps and that's good or limit to less if you want to.",
  "1080P, normal settings, lock your FPS to 30, and have fun. Sure it won't play with the highest graphics, and not at 60fps either, but it will play better than the consoles it launched (PS3\\\\XBOX 360)\n\n  \nIf you don't lock your FPS it might even go closer to 60 in some places, dropping in others... It's your choice. Anyway it's totally  playable, not the best experiencie in the world, but TOTALLY PLAYABLE.\n\n  \nSource: I literally benchmarked this GPU (Intel Iris XE 80EUs) a few days ago...\n\nDepending on the cooling in the laptop you might even go high settings and mantain 30 FPS :)",
  "I think it could work and that was very nice of your mother, please treasure it!",
  "Yes it can but obviously not on high settings, prolly mid..",
  "It has 128MB of VRAM so I'd be surprised if you could.",
  "IDK about GTA 5 but if it's anything like 4 even if the computer's hardware can handle it, the game still might be 80% broken lol. Rockstar doesn't do well with PC gaming since San Andreas",
  "im pretty sure you can run gta on like a fancy toaster if you wanted to, the game is over 10 years old",
  "Yes but low graphics and resolution.",
  "Smoothly on standard settings. Make sure to turn anti aliasing off, that hammers down on performance on the most powerful PCs.",
  "No not atleadt with good graphics",
  "Probably not very well.",
  "If you have GTA V there is no reason not to give it a shot. And if doesn't work but you are describing, you can always try to tinker with the game.",
  "maybe in 720px you can",
  "Use fsr and run everything",
  "In low settings I don't see why not. PS3 could run GTA 5.",
  "Simple answer is yes, complicated answer is not really",
  "Absolutely! The iGPU is powerful and recent. Can play at 1080p medium settings.",
  "I got the same model but imo it's playable on low settings but expect some lags at some point. I've had tons of games played with it and I don't have a problem with such lags like it's not playable as long as it's on low settings. I'm about to switch to a gaming laptop because mine is 5 years old already and I need it for rendering architecture stuff.",
  "yeah, but not at the best settings",
  "Yes but not very smooth",
  "Most definitely can. I have the same specs, except I have a 2060, and the game runs very smoothly even with all my LSPDFR mods. You will have no problem.",
  "Does a bear shit in the woods?",
  "You can, but since GTA VI is about to drop this year, and probably getting a PC version in 2026, i would invest on a laptop without Integrated GPU.",
  "Yes it should run most older titles just fine at 1080p -720p",
  "It’s not necessarily a gaming laptop but if you tweak the settings right on GTA it’ll run.",
  "GTA5 came out on the PS3... That thing had ddr3 gpu memory at 256mb... a whopping 26 shader cores. yours has like 256. If you want to play gta I bet it would run at 720p totally fine, you can 100% play it.",
  "Time for install Linux on it for the superior gaming experience",
  "GTA 5 is technically a game which was at first made to run on the (by today's standards extremely potato) hardware of consoles like the Xbox 360 or PS3.\n\ni do feel like the PC release of GTA 5 is more closely related to the XONE enhanced edition.\n\n\nwhat im trying to say is that if you lower the settings, you will definitely get a smoothly running game, which might even not look like absolute crap. \n\n\nalso, don't quote me on this, as i haven't used a modern Intel CPU since uhh... the 3rd gen, but i did hear that the ones with Iris XE graphics are surprisingly good for integrated graphics. not sure if Intel still uses them in newer chips or if they just shoved a lower power Arc unit in them. so it really depends on what graphics are integrated into your CPU \n\n\nbut just know that people got GTA 5 to be playable on much worse hardware, so i wouldn't worry too much about it.",
  "If you prefer lowest settings then yes",
  "Integrated graphics!?!?",
  "Install it and you'll find your answer.",
  "No.",
  "With enough tinkering, anything works on anything.\n\nNo worries, you’ll make it work. 💪",
  "definitely, i could play online at 60fps on a 3rd gen laptop i7 and nvidia gt 635m graphics. granted it wasn’t pretty but 60fps is 60fps",
  "Reminds me of the past, enjoyed playing GTA V on i3 10th gen U series processor & 8gb ram",
  "it can because its a 13th gen , integrated graphics can handle a 10 year old game.",
  "Gta 5 came out on the ps3 just remember that",
  "Install it and tweak the settings, no reason why you can’t! Everybody is so entitled nowadays with 10 year olds already having super fancy gaming PCs. I swear when I was like 11 with my AMD liano APU powered laptop that was all I gamed on for a few years until I saved up money for a pc",
  "Just take a 1TB SSD because OS + Steam (or Epic games Store) + Rockstar games Social Club + maybe other games. and FYI, to know exactly of your PC can run the game, go to [pcgamebenchmark.com](http://pcgamebenchmark.com) : enter your components or make it detect and you're done =)",
  "Technically yeah, but will it be enjoyable? Probably not.",
  "We would need more info than just “integrated” for GPU. But the processor and memory are good enough.",
  "Yes",
  "Not well.",
  "yes, my friend played gta on a 2013 pentium laptop with igpu, granted he had to manually disable foliage and effects and play at 600p, but this is a spaceship compared to that setup",
  "No",
  "Try running a quick pcbenchmark exe file on it and find out yourself, you can also check some more games in there. It's been a useful tool for me.",
  "Without a discrete GPU, you will not be able to run it very well at all I would think.",
  "yup 1080p with low settings",
  "You can run GTA with half that prob lol",
  "You absolutely can just keep in mind that it’s probably not going to the the best experience ever if you had a 4090 and what not. But you probably already expected that. As long as you’re having fun, that’s all that matters",
  "It’ll definitely run it. You will need to play with settings to get it to look smooth. With integrated graphics I would expect mid settings or lower end of high. Definitely not ultra.",
  " No",
  "GTA V will run on a rock",
  "Nice gift!\nAs for GTA V, itll run, but don't expect miracles, or high settings/resolutions. It would need a dedicated GPU for that, or a reaaally good integrated GPU. As far as im aware, its iGPU is decent, but not high end.\n\nTL;DR: yes, go ahead play GTA V, itll run at 720-1080p with low-medium settings at around 45-60fps. Youll want to play around with the settings and find the optimal mix of settings your eyes prefer. (Some settings increase visual fidelity more than other settings, while using less power than other Settings.)",
  "I run gta with intergrated graphics 16gb ram and i3500h gonna try it again to see if I average 80 or 90 fps",
  "Mhm normal to high at at least 40fps",
  "Possibly.",
  "Low settings and plugged in? Probably no issue. \n\nNot plugged in or medium-to-high settings? Probably not.",
  "Hell Yeah, great game btw",
  "fuck no. salesmen raw dogged your mom. I'd cuss em out.\n\nnaw fr I'll never get these. they're a niche usage.\n\nyou can get a laptop with a gpu for cheaper than most business laptops. and they'll perform better. cause the offload of the cpu.",
  "It says integrated gpu. GTA won't run very well on integrated graphics. You need a discrete gpu.",
  "Just for fun I ran GTAV on an aspire 5 with an i5 10210U/8GB ram, and at 720p normal settings. I was getting 30+ fps. Don't remember if I tried 1080p or not.\n\nI'm sure this 13th gen i5 can run GTAV at 1080p normal settings with a decent framerate while plugged into the power brick. You also have 16GB ram so even better.",
  "Hell yea. I'm running it on a i5 9300h and a 1660mobile. Runs fine at 1080p.",
  "Kitne ka mila",
  "you can try it just do not expect any high settings since its integrated graphics. I had a laptop in the past with a 10th gen i5 and I was able to run GTA V on lowest settings and 720p. Yes 720p is quite a blur on a laptop but hey, you gotta make do wih what you are given. With the 13th Gen you could probably go on 1080p lowest or at least 900p if GTA V has the option for 1600 x 900.",
  "I managed to run GTA v on an i5 coffee lake (I forgot which gen that is) Thinkpad and on the lowest settings it was actually playable",
  "Bad purchase you could have a got a gaming laptop at this price with dedicated gpu",
  "yes you can!not on the highest settings though",
  "U can technically but at extremely low fps and resolution",
  "I have a worse CPU and i could play it. You might struggle a bit with the integrated graphics card not being able to pull a super good performance graphics wise, but you should be fine running it on low settings",
  "It should work, it's an old game. You can also check to see what games you can run at  [can you run it](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri)",
  "Yes you can",
  "Hell yeah, Gta 5 will run smoothly on this, also go say thank you to your mom🫡",
  "Yes. This game is 12 years old.",
  "I played gta 5 on older system and it ran around 30 40 fps, lowest settings in online 2 player lobbies. so you are fine",
  "Yes, 30FPS ultra low settings at 720p...\n\nWhy, WHY don't parents ask their children instead of Walmart salespeople?",
  "That's really weird laptop. 13420H is quite power hungry CPU, but it lacks Xe iGPU, which is probably one of the few good things about Intel CPUs. This CPU should be paired with some dGPU, UHD graphics is more suited for lighter tasks.",
  "yes but i think u gotta lower the graphics",
  "at 720p with lowest settings it would play pretty smoothly. but its going to look like actual turds.",
  "No.  Gta V needs a dedicated graphics card.  You will get like 10 FPS on this thing.",
  "I believe in the minimum you can I don’t have sure, but try, if you can’t don’t be sad and play other games you have a lot of good games to this configuration",
  "Theoretically it can, however, if you run too many programs in the background it will bog down the performance to unplayable. I always look for dedicated GPUs (even lower end ones like a 3050) for a gaming pc so I don’t run into performance issues with shared graphics memory.",
  "Yes. But can it play Crysis?",
  "I wish my mom gifted me anything other than 5$ basic tee’s smh",
  "You can play GTA V on Intel HD 530(Intel 6th gen cpus) and above integrated gpus",
  "GTA ran on Xbox 360 and PS3. This is fine",
  "Afcourse I did to just disable the antivirus bcuz that take so much processing and power and plug in the laptop to charger and do the mix power on the battery setting",
  "60fps at 1080p low, probably. You will have to temper your expectations but yes it will run.",
  "Yes! I tried it on my laptop with very similar specs. It ran 40+ fps with medium settings at 900p. Very playable and good for casual gaming.",
  "Play RDR2 instead",
  "you may be able to play the game regarding the high cpu and ram and it may run on a intergrated GPU just try and use low settings (you may not have the best graphics but you'll defo get loads of FPS)",
  "Yes, that's a very well optimized game.\n\nNow, if you want to play AAA games, you might want to get an eGPU, like a rx6600",
  "Yes",
  "Easily, I played GTA 5 on 8gb ram 11gen i5 with 'U' letter at the last (which means it is not ment for games) in 60fps with 1080p low settings your is 13 gen and has H at the last which means it is made for gaming, but since it doesn't have graphic card it can't game good latest games, but GTA 5 is 19yr old and very well optimized game so you will run it easily at 1080p low settings and maybe even high settings, not maxed out but high settings",
  "Yeah, it’ll handle it. Just start with the lowest quality settings and go from there. Also, make sure to set the laptop on a hard surface so that it can breathe well. It’ll get hot. Don’t be one of those animals that game with their laptop sitting on the bed, please.",
  "Integrated graphics, no it won't work well. It will run, probably at 40fps max which isn't great. It'll be 40fps but feel like 20 because of frame times. It's a 2.1ghz cpu that might boost to 3.5ghz if you're lucky. This is a media laptop, it's meant for watching movies and just general Internet browsing. \n\n\nI actually just looked it up on YouTube, you'll be lucky to hit 30fps. It looks like the frame rate drops hard in the middle of the city and any PC gamer can agree that sudden fps drops are very jarring. Everyone saying it will run fine didn't do a simple Google search, it will run, it will not run well. This laptop will barely be able to run Minecraft. Thank you mother, it's a very kind gift, but didn't get your hopes up about any real performance from this machine.",
  "Idk why would you want to play GTA V on that, don't you have a chair? If you insist, you can, but your ass gonna feel uncomfortable.",
  "I run GTA v in the lower options in a laptop whit a core i7 4600u and 8 in DDR3 ram at 30 fps, you surely can",
  "You can, but on low settings, it might be laggy at times but upgrade the RAM.",
  "I think you can even connect it to a external gpu",
  "Should not be an issue.\n\nI had it installed on a 5th gen i5, it ran like complete ass but ran.",
  "No",
  "No it’s a box.",
  "No, you need to buy the game.",
  "You can attempt if you wish but you’ll get like two fps on the lowest settings",
  "I love how humble u are",
  "Bro i can play it on my HP desktop and that only has 8GB of RAM (albeit it isn’t very smooth) but it runs alright. That will be fine.",
  "It might work on this, but you'll probably have to turn some settings down - very decent machine overall it just doesn't have a graphics processor that is dedicated. Give it a shot, I bet you can get it to run, and just go into the settings and turn down shadow quality first, if you have issues with it. keep coming back and we can help you get it going",
  "Its integrated gpu so uses ram as a vram, if you wanna do gaming on it you need to upgrade your ram minimum to 32 but for gta V it should be enough as it is right now",
  "Yeah it's really cool you can play on android too.",
  "The ONLY issue with that is the integrated graphics card, but gta5 is an older game, and integrated graphics cards have been getting better to my understanding.\n\nRegardless of that laptop playing GTA or not, your mom is an awesome lady who got you a laptop and was deeply thinking about you, she did the absolute best she could with the information and knowledge she had. She even went to someone to ask for help which is all a human can do.\n\nGive your mom a big hug and a think you, she loves you very much and you are lucky to have her as a mom.\n\nGoodluck random human!!",
  "Great specs for a laptop it will run it for sure. You can always look up the minimum specs for the game when you’re in doubt btw",
  "It’s a nice laptop W moms",
  "Probably on low video settings. \n\nThe lack of GPU will hurt it, the rest of the specs are decent.",
  "Yes, with low settings it'll reach maybe 50fps?",
  "Yes but I would never buy an IdeaPad",
  "GTA can run on a potato, just don't expect to get the ultra level settings. It will be quite enjoyable once tweaked.",
  "love ur mom bro.",
  "Get something with a descent gpu. Integrated is mostly trouble and will underperform.",
  "Buy a game console make your life easier.",
  "Gya v is pretty old and should run decently on that",
  "I was running Sims 3 on Intel Celeron which was almost as old as the game itself. Yes, it was absolutely impossible on paper. So I would give it a shot",
  "brother you can pretty much play V on mobiles now",
  "On a box, no.",
  "a bit better than a ps3, but worst than a ps4",
  "I wouldn't probably expect much past 20-30fps on low. But you could try. It shouldn't crash",
  "Lenovo 4L",
  "Just please, for the love of all that is good in this world and your sanity, give up now on playing GTAO... It's completely unplayable on PC due to script kiddies and their damned cheat menus. 😮‍💨",
  "You very seriously can play damn near anything on low setting with onboard graphics nowadays. Pretty impressive little things. You won’t be getting crazy FPS on any settings, but you will be able to play it.",
  "Sell it for a cheap gaming laptop",
  "If it gives you issues on lowest settings I recommend  looking into disabling shadows completely, just requires you to edit an xml file, and I remember it taking the game from choppy 19fps to a solid 35-40ish on my old laptop.",
  "Integrated GPU and 16 Gb ram? Probably no. It will struggle a lot because windows will eat a lot of resources.",
  "You can run GTA V on a toaster.",
  "yeah it can run 4k 120 fps 144hz ultra settings ur good to go",
  "Unlikely",
  "Yeeeah.\n\nNot on insane settings but should run just fine.",
  "It's worth trying. My first laptop was a shitty little Toshiba satellite that I got in 2013 with an i3 and 4GB of ram. It ran most older games ok and could run some newer less demanding games. I just had to crank the settings all the way down.",
  "If you have Problems you could try eGPUs for Laptops. With this your Laptop gets a near a Gaming PC at this Specs. Maybe your next Upgrade? With a RTX mounted you could pla the new Indiana Jones Game.",
  "It can definitely run GTA V. But I hope your mom didnt pay alot and you don't expect to play more graphics intensive games in the future cuz it won't run.",
  "I play fortnite at 60fps on a much worse cpu. Its fine. Go message u/DarkTower7899 , he helped me get from unstabel 30fps to 60fps. And also go check out r/Craptopgamingadvice",
  "Yeah. I ran it on a athlon with vega 3 graphics. 1080 low got pretty smooth frames",
  "You can run doom for sure!",
  "No",
  "expect 30 fps at 1080p low,You can max out textures and drop to 720p for 50fps,I know you shouldn't but ask your mum if you can return the laptop for something with a 5500U or 5600U,It will be quite a bit better in gaming and probably cheaper than the i5 as well",
  "Yes it will run, some people here are so disassociated with the real world its insane. More than half of the pc gamers would be happy to run a game on a window at 800x600 just to hit 30 fps, especially if you are tight on money. Your mom is really cool, appreciate the gift and be a great son to her.",
  "Ram is non upgradable so good that you have 16gbs but if you struggle with space you should have second slot as I see at spec page so you would be able to fit in second m2 ssd to have more space if it would be an issue in the future. Having more there 80% of ssd filled can cause system slowing down a bit so its good to have spare space for it the bare minimum is 10gb to keep windows stable.\n\nNot the gaming beast but solid laptop for daily use. GTA is and old game and should run pretty decent to be playable though on this newer intel chips. Newer games will strugle or even not launch but steam has 2hour refund policy so you can install it and refund immediately if it would be hassle for your device to run it.",
  "The only concern I would have is the integrated graphics, but other people say it can run fine!",
  "I see people playing GTA 5 on Dell Optiplex with the Intel 2600, 16gb, only upgrade is SSD memory playing in 1080p working fine",
  "I mainly use my system for editing content and while I do have GTA V on steam does it allow me to use mods. I see a lot of cool add-ons with the modified version. Can anyone guide me to a link for beginners to play with mods?",
  "yeah 60 fps easily go for it just keep the laptop elevated to regulate temps",
  "Not on high settings.  MAYBE on medium settings with NO shadows.",
  "Let me know how it goes once you install GTA on it and if it works or if it doesn't.",
  "Play gta 5 with the cardboard box or the item inside?",
  "Why don't people ever look up the requirements for the game they're looking to run first? I mean specs are listed for the game everywhere.",
  "The only thing that could be a little off is the processor speed, but other than that yea great laptop.",
  "Can you run it, Perfect little script which checks your computer and analyses if it would be enough to play certain games :)  \n[https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri)",
  "V? My Friend, i run the game on a Q6600, which is a 15 years old cpu...",
  "No",
  "no.",
  "It’s an 8 core 12 thread clocked at 2.1ghz with 16gb of ram. You should be fine for most main stream games and gta should work on low-medium settings around 40-50fps",
  "Yeah",
  "Yes",
  "Yes. Will it work? You'll find out.",
  "yes ofc, dont forget to fry an egg on your laptop while playing.",
  "nvidias geforce now streaming service for the more extensive games.",
  "Jesus you can try if it doesn't fill ur storage",
  "Cross your fingers that integrated gpu is an Intel ARC Processor- those things kick ass",
  "Don’t forget you can put more ram in there, I would ✌️",
  "Your mom is so sweet and you must be an awesome child for her to gift that to you. I think it will run on low settings. If not there are plenty of games on GOG it can run. I'm pretty sure integrated cards can run Starcraft 2 now",
  "Of course you can, the game is a decade old. Might have to turn down a few settings for stable fps, but shell def run it, trust me.",
  "There is also lossless scaling framegen. Best $6.99 I ever spent. [https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless\\_Scaling/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/)",
  "Yes. I play it on this and runs fine",
  "I don’t think it can if u want to game I would try some lighter ones also try GeForce now it’s an amazing platform also u can try gamepass and there cloud gaming software",

That's not enough vram for GTA 5 and the GPU would bottleneck anyway, even with enough vram. 720p30 is not a pleasant experience which was the point of my initial reply. It WILL work but it will NOT be a good experience. GTA:3-SA will run perfectly, GTA4 would be lucky to hit 20 fps and GTA 5 will barely hit 30 in open areas.

  "Is this Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 the right price? Hi,\n\nI am about to place an order for this laptop and I would like to hear from those of you more in touch with the laptop market if this looks like a good price for the configuration below:\n\nLenovo Ideapad Slim 3 15AHP10\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS\n\nRAM: 16GB DDR5 5600MHz (dual channel)\n\nStorage: 1TB SSD M.2\n\nDisplay: 15.3\" IPS, 1920x1200 (WUXGA)\n\nBacklit keyboard\n\nBattery: 60 Wh\n\nPrice in EUR: €600\n\nI haven't bought a laptop in many years, as I mainly work and play on a desktop, but I wanted something relatively compact to take with me while traveling this summer, maybe even do some remote work away from the heat of the big city, play an occasional game, nothing too demanding (Skyrim-level games, so to speak)..., yet not too small (14\") either, as I work with documents and text and I do need some decent display area.\n\nAre there other good choices in this price range?

I don't need OLED, just a good decently accurate and colorful IPS.",
  "I avoided a 2-in-1 for the same reason, as I had been reading about the issues with their hinges; are the regular non 2-in-1s just as bad? \n\nI had a chance to see the Slim 3 today in a showroom and it feels kind of flimsy.. the keyboard is nothing like the ThinkPads I owned, it feels soft/rubberized, with a lot of flex.. the keyboard is almost level with the laptop's surface, not enough travel for good feedback.. I'm considering a Thinkpad, even if with a less powerful CPU, but I haven't seen the newer generations, they may just as well not be the same quality as the older ones...",
  "Hi,\n\nYes, I ended up buying it because I could no longer bear all the browsing and comparing and reading reviews... :)\n\nI had used Thinkpads before, and a year ago I had bought the Ideapad 1 for my daughter to use as her first laptop in school, so I was not totally unfamiliar with Lenovo laptops.\n\nWhat can I say, it is kind of what I expected, build quality seems decent, with an aluminium lid, solid plastic/PCB for the rest of the body, and yes, it is very slim, at least compared to what I had been used to. It doesn't look cheap, I got it in Luna Grey, and it's a very nice metallic color, making it look more expensive than it is.\n\nThe display is the regular WUXGA 1920x1200 which for me is perfect in such a compact form factor (it is a 15.3\" display - which I appreciate for portability, while still offering plenty of space for work thanks to its 16:10 ratio). It is \"only\" 300 nits bright, some people complained about it being too dim for them, but I found it perfectly fine, I use it comfortably at 70-75% brightness (my desktop Dell monitor is only 250 nits and it it is still bright enough!)\n\nPerformance-wise it is as expected from a Ryzen 7 8840HS - snappy in all tasks, it won't get hot with regular office work, browsing, watching videos, etc. So far, so good. The fan only starts with some heavy multitasking, such as downloading and installing a large game while also running online tv in the background and working in Office at the same time... but even so, the fan is not loud at all, you can barely hear it.\n\nI've tested it in some games too, again.. it performs as expected, the integrated Radeon 780M is excellent for \"laptop gaming\", it runs games like Syrim, Fallout New Vegas, etc. perfectly smooth in 1080p (or 1200p for that matter). Of course the very slim case is not optimal for cooling, so for extended gaming, even moderate, I would suggest an additional cooler pad/stand. \n\nOtherwise, I'm pretty happy with it, no issues so far.. if I were to be really picky, I'd say the keyboard could be better, it feels a bit soft for my taste, somewhat rubbery. But the backlight is really useful in dark conditions, and I knew I shouldn't expect a \"Thinkpad level keyboard\". I often work on an external monitor, using an external keyboard, so that is not a serious issue for me anyway.\n\nShortly after I bought it, the price was discounted and I could have gotten the 24GB RAM version instead of the 16GB version, for the same price, but I didn't bother trying to return it and order the one with more RAM, I intend to upgrade it to more than 24GB anyway. I intend to add a 32GB DDR5 stick (in addition to the 8GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard) - a total of 40GB should be plenty for the next few years - the added RAM will really be necessary (especially with the integrated GPU), so I would recommend getting the one with more RAM if you don't plan to upgrade it yourself later.\n\n(I would post photos, but I don't think it's possible here.)",
  "The max it can use is 4GB, I don't think you can change that in BIOS (I don't remember seeing any options related to vram allocation). \n\nIn the meantime I upgraded mine to 24GB RAM (8 soldered + a 16GB DDR5 5600MHz stick). Running Task Manager I can see there are always a total of 20GB available for system, thus the rest of 4GB is reserved for the GPU, which is allocated dynamically in games as needed (you can see all those stats live using the in-game overlay provided by the AMD Adrenalin software).",
  "It's not a heavy duty workstation, it's not meant to be \"overloaded\" with work. For regular office work, for students and even for some light-medium gaming it does work well, it doesn't feel sluggish at all. After all, it is an 8 cores, 16 threads, 5.1 GHz boost clock CPU! And the RAM is DDR5 running at 5600MHz! So it's by no means a slow machine, but you really have unrealistic expectations, what does \"value for money\" mean in this case? The performance of a $3,000 laptop in one that costs $600?\n\nThere are two battery versions available for this model, I went for the higher capacity one (60Whr). Coupled with a low TDP of the CPU (only 28W!), the battery really lasts more than many laptops I owned before.",
  "It depends... which Ryzen 5 CPU? The \"U\" versions of the Ryzen 5 CPUs are cheaper (but also slower, such as Ryzen 5 5625U).\n\nAnd what display? The regular IPS lcd, OLED...?\n\nBut £450 seems a bit expensive, for instance I found this configuration online in my country for about £350 (with further 10% off these days):\n\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15ARP10\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 7533HS (up to 4.4GHz)\n\n15.3\" WUXGA, IPS\n\n16GB DDR5\n\n512GB SSD\n\nI'm pretty sure it does the job for uni, office work, etc.\n\n  \nP.S> Oh, and do go for the highest RAM version (I think they come with a maximum of 24GB), it will help a lot for the future, even if all you do is regular work and study, Windows itself and other software are becoming more and more demanding in terms of memory. The price difference is not that much.\n\n#",
  "Hi, mine is the 60 Wh battery (they larger capacity one) and while I haven't used it exclusively on battery yet, from full to empty, it always shows an estimate of 6-7 hours when I unplug it at full charge. It automatically switches to another power plan for better battery life, which you can adjust further manually for even more battery saving, but I guess it also depends on what kind of work you're doing on your laptop while running on battery and the brightness you set for the display. I'd say you can definitely rely on approximately 6 hours of normal office work, browsing, etc. No gaming on battery, obviously.",
  "I only use it occasionally, when I travel or when I spend the weekend away from home and so. No issues so far, it is (obviously) faster than my desktop's i5-9500 / 32GBRAM and I've even played some games, I happy with the performance and the compact size. I've adjusted the display colors to a cooler temperature as the \"built-in\" blue light protection makes the colors slightly too warm by default.",
  "way better. the steam deck has 4 zen2 cores at max 3.5ghz with a 8cu rdna2 igpu, the 8840hs has 8 zen 4 cores at max 5.1ghz with a 16cu 780m rdna3 igpu. also higher tdp",

  "Just as bad, the hinges in Ideapads 1 and 3 are painfully weak, also tbh not that many laptops can compare to Thinkpad in terms of reliability. You probably should go with some thinkpad if your budget is limited and under 500$\n\nIf you take T or P Thinkpads, they'll serve you good, new or old ones",
  "Am also in same situation,  I shortlisted this an  Thinkpad with R77735HS",

  "Hi man thanks for the review.About Display did you find it to have a yellowish tint as many say?!",
  "How are the thermals? What temperature does the cpu reach while playing?",
  "Hi, the display does show a slightly warm/yellowish tint overall, particularly noticeable with reds - they look somewhat orange, I suspect it's the so called blue light filter built in, but I used the Adrenalin software for the integrated GPU and managed to get reasonably neutral/cooler colors, it now looks similar to my desktop monitor, but if you are a perfectionist, you may need to invest more. But to me, it's not a bad display at all.",

I’m interested in hearing about other people’s experiences with this laptop: how is the battery life, is it fast enough? The screen has an IPS panel, so I don’t think it's too bad in that regard.

Getting 4-5 years out of any laptop is pretty hard without REALLY taking care of it.",

  "i bought the snapdragon version hoping for good battery + speed. instead, what i got - overheating, lag under normal workloads, snapdragon throttling under load, battery dying way faster than promised.",
  "The Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 feels basic and underwhelming. Its plastic build rattles, and the fan noise is annoying even on battery. The screen is okay but nothing special, and the outdated Intel processor struggles with multitasking and gaming. Slow Wi-Fi and limited ports only add to the frustration. For the price, it feels like too many compromises were made, making it a tough recommendation. If you want a budget laptop, there are better options out there that don’t feel this sluggish or cheap. Definitely not a laptop I’d want to rely on daily.",
  "Yes, the screen is 45% NTSC, but I don’t pay too much attention to that because of my limited budget. What matters more to me is that it has good memory and a good processor. The other laptops I’ve looked at in this price range have TN screens, which are much worse.",

I’d say it handled **about 80% of tasks just fine**.\n\nGames I played regularly:\n\n* **FIFA 19 (medium settings)**\n* **League of Legends (low settings)** Both ran **above 60 FPS**.\n\nI also ran **Skyrim, Civilization** and others with no major issues.\n\nWhere it started to struggle was with **heavy multitasking** — many browser tabs, Excel files and apps open simultaneously pushed the RAM to its limit.\n\n# ❌ Why I’m replacing it\n\nThese are the main downsides that accumulated over time:\n\n* **Terrible TN display** — very poor color accuracy and viewing angles, exhausting to look at.\n* **Weak battery** — needs to be plugged in with performance mode on (BIOS + Windows) to behave decently.\n* **Webcam, microphone and speakers are all below average.**\n* **Not lightweight** — not ideal for daily commute.\n* **Recurring BSOD errors over the last 6 months** — reducing GPU-allocated memory and enabling Intelligent Cooling in BIOS helped, but didn’t fix it.\n\nOn the other hand, when using an **external 75 Hz monitor**, the notebook performed surprisingly well — almost like a desktop replacement.\n\n# 🐧 Best performance was on Linux — but not viable for my job\n\nThe most stable and pleasant experience I had was running **Zorin OS (Linux) in Safe Graphics mode**. No BSODs and noticeably better performance.\n\nBut I work with investments and financial analysis, and **full Excel functionality (including plugins and advanced features) is mandatory** — something Linux simply can’t provide.\n\nSo I’ll be moving to a **MacBook Air M4** next month.\n\n# 💰 Resale value\n\nOn the used market in Brazil, I’ll probably sell it for about **R$ 2,000 (\\~$360)**.  \nNew units are going for **around R$ 3,000**, and **I personally wouldn’t pay more than R$ 2,500**.\n\n# 📌 Final verdict\n\nThe **Lenovo IdeaPad 3 15ALC6 is a good laptop — nothing more, nothing less.**\n\nRecommended for:\n\n* **basic and intermediate usage**\n* people who plan to use a **good external monitor**\n* students and casual users\n\nNot recommended for:\n\n* users who care about **display quality**\n* frequent **video callers**\n* **heavy multitaskers**\n* people who need **long battery life**\n\nHope this helps anyone considering this model! 🙌",

  "Lenovo Ideapad slim 3 gen 10 AMD 14\" So i bought this laptop for £469 in the UK for university and i have had it for about a week now and I have not seen any reviews so i thought i would leave a review. It has a ryzen 5 8640hs with integrated radeon graphics, 16gb ram dual channel and a 60wh battery\n\nBuild quality: This laptop is made of sturdy plastic, the finish feels very nice but it is nothing to boast about, it is good enough for the price. I like how it is very lightweight and is really easy to carry around.\n\nDisplay: The anti-glare coating is great for this and really helps when it is sunny outside and the sun is very bright. 1920x1200 is very sharp but other than that its a regular 60hz IPS panel but it definitely gets the job done.\n\nKeyboard: This one does not come with a full size keyboard but I am not too bothered by this personally as I dont usually use the rest of the other keys. Sometimes I do press the wrong keys but once you get used to it, its a solid keyboard.\n\nPerformance: The CPU in this is very fast, whatever I do happens in an instant whether im video editing, watching videos, playing games or in a meeting. The 16gb ram also plays a huge role in this. What surprised me the most was the performance of the GPU considering its only 15W. I dont play very heavy games but this GPU was able to run forza horizon 4, fortnite, GTA, battlefield 1 and hollow Knight at good fps(these are the games I usually play). I also did some wii u emulation and it was flawless. One thing I will mention is that the laptop can be quite noisy when gaming on extreme performance mode but is very quiet when not being pushed.\n\nBattery: The battery on this is great for what it is. I was able to achieve around 7-8 hours from 100 percent to 20 whilst just doing my assignments(on battery saver). I got around 5-6 hours on netflix. When gaming the max i got was around 3 hours of battery life which is not too bad.",

  "Nice review, I just bought the version with AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS with dual RAM of 8 GB each. I hope I don't regret it, but the price of €630 seemed very advantageous to me honestly",

  "Hi! Thanks for the review. Do you think it's worth getting the Ryzen 78840HS version for 40€ more?? I'm gonna be using it for university work. Music production software and other music related software and some gaming",

The trackpad is not good my fingers dont move on it well and it doesn’t feel sturdy it feels pretty cheap. 2. I might of banged it at some stage but I noticed with the display when it shows black things the pixels are blue in a certain spot only a little you can barely notice it but it bothers me.",
  "No problem its a great laptop for its price, still going strong right now",
  "How is the battery?",
  "As far as I'm aware the \"24GB\" version doesn't exist, it can just support up to 24GB, as in you need to buy extra memory and install it yourself. If that's 800USD that's a disgusting price. Are Apple products also more expensive there? Personally I'd be looking into an Air M4 for that price.",
  "Dont get it, its not worth it at that price point",
  "Absolutely, that ryzen 7 is quite a bit faster and will be better for running multiple tasks, the igpu on it is slightly faster than the ryzen 5 one by about 10%. For €40 more yeah i would say its worth it",
  "Cant really say but its most likely similar to this one but with a stronger gpu and cpu",
  "Its holding up great the battery and performance is still good",
  "In reality it has yet to arrive, they're taking a long time to ship and maybe I'm changing my mind, opting for a thinkpad for €100 more though",
