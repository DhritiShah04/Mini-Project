        "Hey so here are my thoughts on my laptop I also do not know anything about its gaming capabilities as i have only played Forza horizon 4 on it and its an absolute breeze but I believe the 5070 will hold up So my main use case is on Ansys mechanical and Optislang so I dont find delays of any sort and also when using the GPU acceleration my simulations run pretty quickly as compared to my previous laptop which had a i51240p with no graphics card and the difference is astronomical especially all CAD tasks are smooth as butter with that said I do feel that the battery like could be improved as on a single charge it only lasts about 45 hours and prolly 6 hours of light usage and also the magic bay i have not used it but i feel it is not really required The build quality is top notch The keyboard is also good but not thinkpad p1 level And display is actually pretty good Also there is little to no thermal throttling so far and the fans dont even spin at light use cases Anyways my verdict is that its a really good laptop go for it if your budget allows you to It costed almost 1900",

        "Best review on this model out there Those youtube reviewers should take notes I returned mine as well for similar reasons Here are my observations 1 Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video This applies even in battery saver mode Fans are not quiet either 2 This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch So that single sided PCB and cooling is working Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming 3 There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75 of the time you are using laptop I dont know if it is Lenovos AI Core learning usage patterns or some other softwarefirmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times And whenever there is something loading like a tabvideo you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip 4 IPS Screen has 100 perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a glow at all times Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the videoscene you are watching For comparison I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrastblacks 5 Build quality is good not as good as XPS or Thinkpad but very acceptable The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound 6 Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab However if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows You have to refresh the windowtab to reinitiate a stream I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7 7 I have read several people had trackpadtouchpad becoming unresponsive issue after a few mins of idling but I didnt have this issue I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop 8 Full size 2280 M2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover I wouldnt recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly Also you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so Probably thats why Lenovo didnt ship it with a 2280 I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender So yes very good slimlight laptop overall 153 screen size is perfect too though I hope these spinning wheel fan noise trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead",
        "re the touch pad i usually use a wireless mouse so not worried about that Good report im seriously looking at one now using a HP Specter 360 its been good for 7 years but falling apart now This Lenevo is getting good reviews",
        "It could match a MacBook Pro though and still be a horrible laptop For example unless its one of the newest MacBook pros you might be used to an incredibly glossy screen that leads to a busted user experience if there are windows or uncontrolled lights nearby My M1 Max MacBook Pro was also incredibly laggy for things like window snapping and some other things where I couldnt get rid of the animation and you just have to wait for part of a second from time to time before you can do things Pretty amazing that it compares to a multithousand dollar laptop but also multithousand dollar laptops these days can be pretty disgusting or at least that has been my experience with the M1 Max and some Windows laptops from Dell Asus and Framework being laggy with windows 11 Maybe its just a software problem though and I shouldnt be comparing wildly inefficient operating systems like Mac OS and Windows 11 to things like debloated Windows 10 or Linux on a 12yearold Thinkpad originally rated for 24 hours of battery life"

        "Thinkbook 16p gen 4 vs legion slim 7 Amd Im coming from a 2020 MacBook Pro 13 with gen 10 i5 and Im gonna need a windows machine for university last two years in mechanical engineering Ive been flawlessly using boot camp since now but I dont think its gonna be able to keep up with the other programs we are gonna use The choice came down to these two mainly because of the design portability and powerprice ratio Ive also been thinking about using a desktop remotely through my Mac but I dont need that much power nor having to leave it on every time With actual sales they both sell for 1600 The main differences and concerns between these two are the following bigger trackpad on the thinkbook and Im a big trackpad user the battery is bigger on the legion 99 vs 80 the thinkbook gets the i9 13900H or the i7 13700H for roughly the same price but maybe the i9 is overkill and drains too much power On the other hand the ryzen 7 on the legion appears to be much more powerful efficient while on battery I was also concerned about the number of p cores on the intel vs the amd which instead has no e cores apparently the silent mode on the legion allows better performances is it because of different cooling system the thinkbook has ir so works with face unlock on the thinkbook configurator it doesnt allow me to have both 32 gb of ram and the 32k monitor Fortunately both the ram are upgradable the legion has a soldered one so I can buy the 88 version and switch them in the future if I need the WQXGA display has better nits on the legion than the thinkbook 500 vs 400 Id like to know if the 32k monitor is any better than the WQXGA 2560 x 1600 and if its battery killer too because is available in both They both have the 4060 8gb that is more than enough for what I need but should allow some gaming and 3d modeling and rendering room If anyone has any advice or maybe can suggest another laptop with similar design Id be really happy",
        "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review Too many flaws Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through its paces I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo Shipping was fast packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess Some context Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows Surface laptop 4 Pretty good but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping and random restarts Sold it after a bit Lenovo Slim 7 pro X Great machine but had two major issues System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios disabling it fixed the lockups Also there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times Lenovo Slim pro 7 Excellent machine literally zero issues Truly a unicorn The build quality was terrible and thus I returned it Decent aluminum enclosure but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges Honestly wish I kept it after this Surface Laptop 7 Excellent laptop ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought Sold it and stuck with X86 A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo Lets get into the Aura Build quality Its alright Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7 Durability concerns are no more Port cutouts are somewhat sharp and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts Some ports are slightly misaligned but everything fits Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac but itll do Hinge feels fine trackpad is installed firm with no rattle I hate the YOGA text on the palmrest Its clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout and not very well mind you with the text slightly misaligned It just looks a bit cheap Overall its well built enough for most people to be happy but its nowhere near some of its competitors Display Mostly very good Very bright very colorful great pixel density 120hz good touch implementation and completely free of defects Its not all great though I generally prefer IPS panels but the contrast on this one doesnt cut it All IPS panels have IPS glow but this one has the worst case of glow Ive ever seen Its even noticeable looking at it straight on making the panel look almost TN at times This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content Its not terrible but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS Note there is likely a display lottery here so youre mileage may vary Trackpad keyboard The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic but its a very good traditional unit Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click Feels responsive when its working more on that later gestures work great at least as good as they can in W11 Keyboard is excellent ThinkPad level Wonderful tactility and travel The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great Backlighting is uniform and consistent if not a little too bright on its dimmest setting Speakers Completely blown away by these Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience but these are excellent Definitely a bit bass heavy but no distortion at normal volume levels They sound full and mostly clear could do with a bit more midrange Head and shoulders above any windows machine Ive ever used period Performance noise A little disappointed in the noise output No complaints with performance Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste Dont get me wrong huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked but its not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz the fans are frequently noticeable especially with heavy multitasking Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up The system is not hot or even warm really its just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems Miscellaneous software WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far No dropping of connections connects upon waking etc Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop Windows came with some bloat including McAfee but all was easy to get rid of Windows hello has been mostly reliable minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode I had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444 No specific setting did the trick it seems to be a bit broken at the moment Adding on to the state of Intel software every time I reboot this thing Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display prompting me to go in and reset all color settings Tried different drivers among other things to no avail Very strange issue Phantom touches Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as Im working Extremely annoying The dealbreakers I dont know about you but I prefer my touchpad to work properly I mean that cant be too much to ask right Well either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature or there is some sort of driver hardware issue After a period of inactivity like say 13 minutes the trackpad will frequently enter a sleep state and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up which is extremely annoying Ive tried a few fixes for this including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches but the issue persists Never experienced anything like this Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware Even if it is a hardware issue Id honestly rather not give Lenovos QC lottery another shot Besides we already have issues with the touchscreen windows hello and flaky Intel software while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless Lenovo can make a good computer but this isnt one of them at least mine isnt Conclusion I really wanted this to be good It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker not to mention the other quirks Regardless Im not keen on trying a replacement Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it Edit I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues Only bare essential drivers installed The system feels much faster now and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor but the trackpad issue persists Looks like its going back Edit 2 For those PWM or dithering sensitive this section is for you It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook pressure in sinuses headache etc Its likely temporal dithering as the IPS panel is PWM free It affects external monitors too which points to the iGPU being the issue 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help I tried using Ditherig software to disable dithering and while it does have an effect on dithering color banding the strain remains"

        "Thinkbook 16p gen 4 vs legion slim 7 Amd Im coming from a 2020 MacBook Pro 13 with gen 10 i5 and Im gonna need a windows machine for university last two years in mechanical engineering Ive been flawlessly using boot camp since now but I dont think its gonna be able to keep up with the other programs we are gonna use The choice came down to these two mainly because of the design portability and powerprice ratio Ive also been thinking about using a desktop remotely through my Mac but I dont need that much power nor having to leave it on every time With actual sales they both sell for 1600 The main differences and concerns between these two are the following bigger trackpad on the thinkbook and Im a big trackpad user the battery is bigger on the legion 99 vs 80 the thinkbook gets the i9 13900H or the i7 13700H for roughly the same price but maybe the i9 is overkill and drains too much power On the other hand the ryzen 7 on the legion appears to be much more powerful efficient while on battery I was also concerned about the number of p cores on the intel vs the amd which instead has no e cores apparently the silent mode on the legion allows better performances is it because of different cooling system the thinkbook has ir so works with face unlock on the thinkbook configurator it doesnt allow me to have both 32 gb of ram and the 32k monitor Fortunately both the ram are upgradable the legion has a soldered one so I can buy the 88 version and switch them in the future if I need the WQXGA display has better nits on the legion than the thinkbook 500 vs 400 Id like to know if the 32k monitor is any better than the WQXGA 2560 x 1600 and if its battery killer too because is available in both They both have the 4060 8gb that is more than enough for what I need but should allow some gaming and 3d modeling and rendering room If anyone has any advice or maybe can suggest another laptop with similar design Id be really happy",
