        "Review of Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 15in 16gb 512gb SSD AMD Ryzen 5700u I bought the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 15in 16gb 512gb SSD AMD Ryzen 5700u in India Here is my review about it after using it for about 2 weeks Build Update after 14 months 16 Oct 2022 Shit quality hinge Broke twice till now without ever dropping the laptop Full plastic build Metal Lid Matte finish Feels great and solid Keyboard and touchpad are great General things 1 Initially I had some problem with the speakers when they would stop working and I had to restart the laptop to fix I got a driver update a couple days later havent had that same problem since 2 The fingerprint can be a hit or miss sometimes due to its design I then added my fingerprint from multiple angles so mostly works but sometimes have to try again 3 My unit had some backlight bleed on the bottom right corner noticeable when in a dimly lit room at above 70 brightness Not a problem for me since I dim the screen to around 30 in the dark This will vary by laptop though 4 I have a problem with OBS recordings It seems that OBS is recording at same volume as windows master volume I havent been able to find a fix for it Every program I tried which captures audio from speakers to recordbroadcast OBS XSlit Anydesk have the same issue EDIT FIX Roll Back Realtek R Audio drivers so that the manufacturer is Microsoft Dolby audio will stop working though if you do it Not recommended 5 The product description states that it has Bluetooth 50 but the device manager says its Bluetooth 51 Expandability I opened mine up coz of curiosity The internal design is the same as last years version 1 The RAM is soldered in dual channel Task Manager 2 There is one M2 NVME SSD slot which is already populated with the 512 GB SSD 3 There is a space for an HDD but it doesnt come with the SATA cable installed the SATA cable will need to be purchased separately to install a hard drive within the laptop 4 The laptop comes with WIFI 5 and not WIFI 6 unlike last years version The WIFI card is upgradable if you need WIFI 6 5 The internal battery can also be upgraded to 70 Whrs version However note that if you do upgrade it will occupy the HDD slot aswell Link

qbittorrent downloading and a bunch of other background programs Battery saving mode from Vantage software Better battery saving mode in windows 6 to 7 hrs Note I use my laptop on conservation mode all the time so it charges only to 60 The battery life is based on the time it take to drain the laptop from 60 to around 30 and multiplying that by 3 The conservation mode is not customizable Its either 60 charge or 100 charge Also I absolutely love the conservation mode no other brands have this Asus and Dell also have it according to the internet My laptop remains on the desk most of the time so I dont have to worry about it remaining on 100 all the time Fans In an air conditioned room On Battery The laptop fans are completely off when watching movies They may or may not turn on when

        "Valuable information my friend I have a similar laptop but the Pro series Would I see a major difference in battery drain and temperature if I turn on Extreme Performance in BIOS but Balanced mode on Windows Also does it make any sense to do this for gaming purposes Because if youre going to play while the system is AC wired the TDP would be higher than 25W anyways am I right"

        "Omg Thank You soo much for posting this review I am unable to decide between this Ideapad and the Legion 5 with 4600H as both are very similarly priced Could you tell me what price did you buy this at Cause right now it is 68k INR And is it worth the price How is the cooling on this laptop Does it heat up under mediumheavy loads Especially without air conditioning Does it stutter or lag a bit when you launch an app or open a web browser or type Especially when on battery I tried the Intel model for the Ideapad which apparently uses the same body and parts as the Ryzen 5700U model I did not find the keyboard and the touchpad as good as I was expecting but I could be wrong cause I only tried it for a few seconds Is the battery replaceable easily removeable by the user Or does one have to take it to a service center I was also considering the HP laptops with Ryzen 5500U but the 15in my preferred screen size has a TN panel while the 14in does have IPS but is glossy I need antiglare so it doesnt strain my eyes The Ideapad 5 and Legion 5 just seem so much better",

and touchpad are great General things 1 Initially I had some problem with the speakers when they would stop working and I had to restart the laptop to fix I got a driver update a couple days later havent had that same problem since 2 The fingerprint can be a hit or miss sometimes due to its design I then added my fingerprint from multiple angles so mostly works but sometimes have to try again 3 My unit had some backlight bleed on the bottom right corner noticeable when in a dimly lit room at above 70 brightness Not a problem for me since I dim the screen to around 30 in the dark This will vary by laptop though 4 I have a problem with OBS recordings It seems that OBS is recording at same volume as windows master volume I havent been able to find a fix for it Every program I tried which captures audio from speakers to recordbroadcast OBS XSlit Anydesk have the same issue EDIT FIX Roll Back Realtek R Audio drivers so that the manufacturer is Microsoft Dolby audio will stop working though if you do it Not recommended 5 The product description states that it has Bluetooth 50 but the device manager says its Bluetooth 51 Expandability I opened mine up coz of curiosity The internal design is the same as last years version 1 The RAM is soldered in dual channel Task Manager 2 There is one M2 NVME SSD slot which is already populated with the 512 GB SSD 3 There is a space for an HDD but it doesnt come with the SATA cable installed the SATA cable will need to be purchased separately to install a hard drive within the laptop 4 The laptop comes with WIFI 5 and not WIFI 6 unlike last years version The WIFI card is upgradable if you need WIFI 6 5 The internal battery can also be upgraded to 70 Whrs version However note that if you do upgrade it will occupy the HDD slot aswell Link to Lenovos Spare parts website of this model IdeaPad 5 ALC05 Type 92LN Spare parts Battery life estimates from 100 percent battery 70 brightness 1 Watching movies Chrome with 5 extensions 1 tab open discord telegram anydesk Battery saving mode active from Vantage software Better battery saving mode in windows 9hrs 2 Moderate Multi tasking Listening to music actually using chrome discord qbittorrent downloading and a bunch of other background programs Battery saving mode from Vantage software Better battery saving mode in windows 6 to 7 hrs Note I use my laptop on conservation mode all the time so it charges only to 60 The battery life is based on the time it take to drain the laptop from 60 to around 30 and multiplying that by 3 The conservation mode is not customizable Its either 60 charge or 100 charge Also I absolutely love the conservation mode no other brands have this Asus and Dell also have it according to the internet My laptop remains on the desk most of the time so I dont have to worry about it remaining on 100 all the time Fans In an air conditioned room On Battery The laptop fans are completely off when watching movies They may or may not turn on when multi tasking Plugged in The fans only turned off when set to Battery Saving Mode in Vantage and doing light tasks Fans are inaudible if they do turn on when doing basic tasks in a room with air conditioner running only slightly audible with the air conditioner off iGPU Out of the 16gb ram 2GB is dedicated for the iGPU this can be changed in BIOS to 1GB or 512 MB Lenovo Power Management modes Extreme Performance TDP is 35 Watts Intelligent Cooling TDP is 25 Watts Battery Saving Mode TDP is 15 Watts On Battery change to best performance windows and these modes function the same as plugged in I did notice that Battery Saver Mode Vantage turns on the fans later than the Intelligent cooling mode which is I guess nice if youre trying to save battery Performance Benchmarks Plugged inExtreme

Write Performance Benchmarks on battery The laptop can achieve full performance on battery as well change from Better Battery mode to Best performance mode in the Windows battery settings Note On battery Better Battery and Battery Saver mode locks the CPU at base clock of 18 Ghz to get maximum battery life While using this mode I did not suffer any hanging when doing casual tasks Web browsing YouTube Discord etc If you wanna know something else about it Please let me know Ill try to get back to you as soon as possible EDIT 1 Added Benchmarks EDIT 2 Photo of the internals Disassembly video from YouTube not the exactly same model EDIT 3 4 Added battery benchmarks then deleted them because I tested them on Better battery mode which locks the clock speed to 18Ghz Edit 5 Cleaned up the post Update as of 8 Sept 2021 I have been having some weird touchpad problem Details here This has not been fixed after a touchpad replacement so currently working on it The issue does seem isolated to just me though Edit 6 Update as of 16 Oct 2022 The hinge is shit quality it has broken twice till now in the exact same manner with completely normal use",
        "Beware Major Touchpad Problem I bought a Lenovo Ideapad Silm 5 laptop in Aug 23 and I thought all is well until a few months in My touchpad stopped functioning but thankfully the onsite warranty allowed me to change my motherboard A few months down the road the same issue arose and I was told by the customer hotline to undergo numerous upgrading of software restarting of laptop etc and the touchpad would mysteriously function after a monthsweeks until it breaks down again This laptop is reaching its 1 year mark and the same issue still persists It has been a major inconvenience especially since a mouse cannot entirely replace the functions of the touchpad ie pinching inout to enlarge the text To my dismay I was told by the onsite warranty engineer that the touchpad issue is rampant in laptops of this particular model I asked for an upgrade of my laptop or replacement of another model but I was told that this was not Lenovos usual practice Am still monitoring the issue after the engineer has replaced the touchpad for second time but if anything please do not purchase this model unless you are willing to forgo its touchpad Trust me their onsite warranty they provide is not worth in exchange for your sanity if you were to constantly experience the same issue The warranty team somehow does not understand what intermittent issue mean and theyll put you through the arduous process of troubleshooting and restarting only for you to find yourself back to square one PS My USB ports were also not working but its fixed atm"
