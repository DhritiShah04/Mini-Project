        "Lenovo Ideapad slim 3 gen 10 AMD 14 So i bought this laptop for 469 in the UK for university and i have had it for about a week now and I have not seen any reviews so i thought i would leave a review It has a ryzen 5 8640hs with integrated radeon graphics 16gb ram dual channel and a 60wh battery Build quality This laptop is made of sturdy plastic the finish feels very nice but it is nothing to boast about it is good enough for the price I like how it is very lightweight and is really easy to carry around Display The antiglare coating is great for this and really helps when it is sunny outside and the sun is very bright 1920x1200 is very sharp but other than that its a regular 60hz IPS panel but it definitely gets the job done Keyboard This one does not come with a full size keyboard but I am not too bothered by this personally as I dont usually use the rest of the other keys Sometimes I do press the wrong keys but once you get used to it its a solid keyboard Performance The CPU in this is very fast whatever I do happens in an instant whether im video editing watching videos playing games or in a meeting The 16gb ram also plays a huge role in this What surprised me the most was the performance of the GPU considering its only 15W I dont play very heavy games but this GPU was able to run forza horizon 4 fortnite GTA battlefield 1 and hollow Knight at good fpsthese are the games I usually play I also did some wii u emulation and it was flawless One thing I will mention is that the laptop can be quite noisy when gaming on extreme performance mode but is very quiet when not being pushed Battery The battery on this is great for what it is I was able to achieve around 78 hours from 100 percent to 20 whilst just doing my assignmentson battery saver I got around 56 hours on netflix When gaming the max i got was around 3 hours of battery life which is not too bad",
        "Hi Thanks for the review Do you think its worth getting the Ryzen 78840HS version for 40 more Im gonna be using it for university work Music production software and other music related software and some gaming",
        "Absolutely that ryzen 7 is quite a bit faster and will be better for running multiple tasks the igpu on it is slightly faster than the ryzen 5 one by about 10 For 40 more yeah i would say its worth it"

        "Based on 47Whr battery it will last you prob 5hrs at best when you do a battery saver setting But thats what should have been with budget laptop If by light gaming you mean games that can be played with iGPU then its no problem About heating issues as long as the fan is working it wont be a problem Cooling pad is recommended tho Can this last 4 years depends on how you use it And probably the first problem that you will have within 4 years is not enough storage",
        "I wouldnt recommend it While its generally the cheapest on paper for the hardware you get all models of Ideapad Gaming 3 that I know of have bad thermal issues Id stay away from them",
        "Should I buy the Lenovo ideapad gaming 3 So I have the option of getting the Lenovo ideapad gaming 3 for the equivalent price of around 800 with these specs 19201080 FHD LCD 120Hz with FreeSync Ryzen 5 4600H Nvidia GTX 1650 4gb GDDR6 45Wh battery 8gb DDR4 RAM speed not listed 512 GB NVME SSD Im a student so I cant go over 800 in budget and this is the cheapest gaming laptop in my country at the time of writing this If I want to buy another laptop under this price then Ill need to import but thatll mean I lose warranty which I care about I plan on keeping it for atleast 5 years and i dont really play AAA titles mostly just csgo and rocket league and maybe some GTA but Id like to have it run some intensive titles on medium settings if I ever do decide to play them Also down the line I might upgrade the ram to 16gb since every review said the laptop has 2 ram slots The colour accuracy and reproduction doesnt really matter since I dont do any editing work at all but Ill be coding on the machine so itll need to be able to do that pretty well The closest competition to this that I could find was the Acer nitro 5 with around the same specs but Ive heard the keyboard on that laptop wasnt very comfortable to use and that the response times of the display were worse Any suggestions"

        "Dalportodev has a review on his youtube channel of this Laptop I bought it myself I really like it the touchpad is not very good but I can live with it The temperature when playing Total War Warhammer got to around 90 degrees celcius but after undervolting it to 0140 mV the temperature is around 65 degrees celcius Undervolting this laptop is a must according to dalportodev I bought it from komplett in Norway for 6500 the 1050 version so the 1650 might get a bit hotter maybe"

        "Planning to buy a lenovo ideapad 3 slim ryzen 7 5000 series laptop Thoughts in this Full specs in the pic Somehow I cant find any reviews on this specific model I think its because its in my regioncountry only To clarify my purpose of buying this is for light gaming studies programming multitasking Im fine with ram being soldered Will use this 4 years minimum In general can anyone who usesused lenovo ideapad 3 any models or this in particular share their experience and if there are any issues any reviews or feedbacks Questions Can this last for 4 years How many hours does battery last based on ur experience Any heating issues Is it recommended to buy a cooling pad right away Can it handle minor damages Or if you better recommendations pls feel free to do so Though dont recommend me thinkpads i know its good but i have a budget and need cheaper like this Thank you",
        "honestly if battery life and longterm reliability matter and youre not gaming much just get a MacBook Air youll get like 1520 hrs real use no fan no random performance drops and it stays fast for years macOS handles school office stuff zoom and light coding effortlessly for most students it just works but if youre doing certain types of programming especially stuff like machine learning CUDA or algorithmheavy courses that require Windowsspecific tools or GPU acceleration then yeah a Windows laptop might make more sense depends on what youre studying and whether your coursework leans heavily on Windowsonly dev environments edit the IdeaPad 3 youre looking at uses integrated graphics Radeon Vega 8 so no dedicated GPU its fine for light gaming or basic rendering but its not gonna handle anything GPUheavy also unlike something like an M4 or M3 Mac which has dedicated mediaGPU cores optimized for ML tasks this is just CPU iGPU as for reliability IdeaPad 3s are budgettier machines they work but dont expect amazing build quality plastic chassis average screens and thermals can get loud under load itll probably get you through 4 years if you take care of it but its not something youll want to hold onto long after that"

        "Should I buy the Lenovo ideapad gaming 3 So I have the option of getting the Lenovo ideapad gaming 3 for the equivalent price of around 800 with these specs 19201080 FHD LCD 120Hz with FreeSync Ryzen 5 4600H Nvidia GTX 1650 4gb GDDR6 45Wh battery 8gb DDR4 RAM speed not listed 512 GB NVME SSD Im a student so I cant go over 800 in budget and this is the cheapest gaming laptop in my country at the time of writing this If I want to buy another laptop under this price then Ill need to import but thatll mean I lose warranty which I care about I plan on keeping it for atleast 5 years and i dont really play AAA titles mostly just csgo and rocket league and maybe some GTA but Id like to have it run some intensive titles on medium settings if I ever do decide to play them Also down the line I might upgrade the ram to 16gb since every review said the laptop has 2 ram slots The colour accuracy and reproduction doesnt really matter since I dont do any editing work at all but Ill be coding on the machine so itll need to be able to do that pretty well The closest competition to this that I could find was the Acer nitro 5 with around the same specs but Ive heard the keyboard on that laptop wasnt very comfortable to use and that the response times of the display were worse Any suggestions",
