        "I think that you may be buying into a gimmick Do I know for sure No The fact I have never heard of trading computers is my reason for thinking Just buy a regular gaming laptop Those are built to be reliable for gaming and what does gaming and trading have in common Fast reactions to internet stuff Gamers rely on that delay being as low as possible Traders do too"

        "Confused over CPU selection between i512450H on MSI Thin Ryzen 57 7HS on ASUS TUF with RTX 3050 Initial budget was 50k but kept a range up to 55k now extending to 60k due to online bad customer service reviews of MSI at India Open for suggest for other modelsspecs or budget increase With 60k budget I should not expect much powerful laptop really do high intensive tasksusages on it which I am going to mention below Some of these are my primary usages that I am going to mention will do it at regular basis I will point out that there But there are some additional usages which I wont do at all but might do if it meets system requirements be able to run I will point out that as well when mentioning those usages I am not keeping those additional usages in mind to buy the new laptop but I am open for a budget increase specifications change or any new model you can suggest for my all of the usages primary additional My primary uses 1 Software Development Web Application Development 2 Mobile Application Development Android Official page of Android says it needs minimum 8GB recommended 16GB RAM Regarding CPU I am not understanding it It requires 2nd generation Intel Core or newer CPUs or AMD CPU with support for Windows Hypervisor 3 Graphics Photo Editing I prefer Adobe Photoshop software for photos editing on laptop 4 Graphics Logo Design I will be preferring Adobe Illustrator on laptop Currently using Canva but will explore Adobe Illustrator also in addition to Canva Graphics Video Editing Currently using other available alternatives due to limited system resources I have But here I want to use Adobe Premiere Pro Wondershare Filmora Filmora did not run on my current laptop I want to use DaVinci Resolve as well but I do not know or not sure whether it will run on the laptop with these specifications that I am going to mention Exception Video Editing DaVinci Resolve might create a problem for me looks like Please suggest help me here Note 1 Above tasks are my primary usages these tasks Im going to do at a regular basis Software Development is primary use followed by Graphics Design second primary usage but important use for me My additional uses Note 2 Below tasks are optionalnegligible usealmost nil usagezero usage I guess these might not run on my specifications that am getting on a laptop at this price So if you need to suggestrecommend alternative specificationsmodels or a budget increase I am open for it 1 Animation Not going to do any high end animations currently Low end animations is what I am looking for if I at all am going to do it if it runs 2 Gaming Occasional gaming Not a slightest chance of playing games on laptop but MSI ASUS are built for such stuffs So if time permits I will get my hands dirty by playing games Also on purpose to upload gameplay videos on YouTube to be able to monetize it on YT If not monetizable on any platform I mostly wont play games at all Note Prices have dropped at online due to festive offers which might be a better thing for me These prices mentioned below is slightly 3k4k bucks higher at India at the time of writing Below are the specifications I chose initially at 52k bucks at India running on MSI Thin series laptop without offers 512GB SSD Intel i512450H CPU 4GB RTX 3050 GPU 16GB DDR4 RAM 8GB each on 2 slots Without offers I am getting ASUS TUF F15 laptop with below specifications at 70k bucks 512GB SSD Intel i512500H CPU 4GB RTX 3050 GPU 16GB DDR5 RAM 4800MHz mentioned on AmazonFlipkart major ecommerce platform from India currently owned by Walmart do not know since how many years says it is 16GB DDR4 RAM 8GB on each 2 slots Without offers may be I am getting ASUS TUF A15 series laptops at approximate 60k bucks range 512GB SSD AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS CPU at 60k bucks AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS CPU at 63k bucks 4GB RTX 3050 GPU 16GB DDR5 RAM 5600MHz 8GB on each two slots But another concern here is MSI customer servicing at India not so good even bad if its not under warranty at India My friend laptop MSI got replaced because it was under warranty ASUS customer service is great here at India So had to move to ASUS TUF models Now I am confused whether to go for AMD Ryzen CPUs on ASUS laptop at 6062k price or for Intel CPUs on MSI I will extend warranty for its customer service Only if Ryzen 5 or 7 7 HS variant series is great enough in comparison to i512th gen CPUs After all ASUS TUF is selling Intel CPU i512th gen at higher price than AMD Ryzen CPUs with other specifications same So Intel CPUs will be of course better than AMD Ryzen series I am adding another flexibility open for any recommendation for specifications change seriesmodel change like shall I get MSI Cyborg with i513th gen or consider i7 CPUs or any other GPU or a budget increase Now the prices have dropped at online stores due to festival offers here at India And my graphics usage exclusively may be for DaVinci Resolve might create a problem but then I am okay if its in this budget to use Adobe Premier Pro Filmora or Shotcut"

        "Have any brand recommendations And I understand weight is another price consideration Any thoughts on that Im probably looking in the 600 range but I can go up or down 100 or so Edit also what are your thoughts on Snapdragon X Elite I dont plan to play video games or video editing but Im sure Ill have a bunch of Internet windows open",
        "I think that you may be buying into a gimmick Do I know for sure No The fact I have never heard of trading computers is my reason for thinking Just buy a regular gaming laptop Those are built to be reliable for gaming and what does gaming and trading have in common Fast reactions to internet stuff Gamers rely on that delay being as low as possible Traders do too",

        "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy Maybe anyone knows a model which I havent checked out yet I have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation I am a software developer My requirements are 1516 inch screen size I am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen 16 inch would be perfect since 1410 ratio is nice for productivity I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy GPU i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better 3050 should be plenty enough though I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance Games I wanna play are aoe4 cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800 as well as older titles Thunderbolt usb 4 is not required I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit 12th gen is a huge step forward Correct me if I am wrong I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred 16GB of ram upgradeable if possible I would not mind having 32 also Storage does not matter as I am probably going to use buy an SSD that I like If it has 1TB thats a bonus It does not have to be a thin light Model weight is not that important however the dimensions should not be that big I enjoy small bezels Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB My selection so far Asus vivobook 16 pro there are many versions 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites has rtx 3050 oled looks cool worried about sunlight though Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store Lenovo Legion 5 pro there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging Lenovo yoga slim 7 pro cheaper than the vivobook but reviews are pretty bad not really convinced about brightness either Asus Zephyrus g15 again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality was looking at the g14 too but its probably too small I dont really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000 I guess thats not gonna meet with my requirements though No problem with buying used btw I would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above",
        "Looking to upgrade from Dell Precision 3510 very specific requirements help needed Hi yall Im looking for a new laptop to set me up for the next 4 years I do software engineering and will be starting a PhD soon with a lot of modelling and simulation work involved so I need something snappy I am located in United Kingdom UK I am looking to upgrade from a Dell Precision 3510 with the following specs Intel Core i76820HQ 4c8t 8MB L3 16GB DDR4 2133MHz AMD Radeon HD 8830M dGPU 256GB Samsung PM951 NVMe SSD 156 screen 62 sRBG 04 black level 84Wh battery 3kg combined laptop charger weight 3 years extended onsite warranty Heres a review of my current laptop at NotebookCheck they are my most trusted review site Here are my requirements for new laptop with explanation 8 cores 16 threads 16MB L3 cache I will be doing a lot of multithreaded work and I run a lot of software at the same time anyway Been stuck with 4c8t for a while now so I want to futureproof by upping my core and thread counts Same goes for the cache size increase 32GB DDR4 I find myself hitting around 12GB while developing software at work and Ill need more RAM in future for working with large datasets for my research iGPU preferred dGPU acceptable I never use the dGPU its a waste of weight and energy for me I dont game and I dont plan on writing any CUDA code for my research or if I do I will be running it on a university cluster at that point not my laptop I think most of my specs put me in the gaming laptop segment and so I am willing to take any dGPU if I have no choice otherwise but its totally irrelevant to me 512GB SSD with 2000 MBs sequential readwrite SSD is limiting factor for a lot of tasks and Ive been stuck with this PM951 at 900 MBs sequential read and 300 MBs write I know there are way faster SSDs available now like Samsung 970 Evo Plus with 2000 MBs sequential read and write I am always running out of space at 256GB but I think 512GB or 1TB would be sufficient for me 14 screen 90 sRGB 03 black level or better I dont have a TV I watch all my media on my laptop so I want something with good colour range and reasonable contrastblack level I am happy to go down to 14 which would help with weight and power consumption without being too small I think 13 would be a bit too small for me though I am happy to go larger as well I know there are 16 builds available now but I need to weigh that against the weight and power consumption 80Wh battery I do use my laptop unplugged a lot and I know the battery will wear down over time so I want to get large capacity to set me up with 10hrs runtime which I expect to run down to 5hrs over the next 4 years Max 3kg combined weight 25kg preferred Heavy laptop sucks for portability As long as its no more heavy than my current laptop plus charger I can survive but Id love to get something lighter 3 years extended warranty option onsite preferred Obviously my laptop is incredibly important to me so I need a good warranty in case it breaks Onsite is preferred because then I can get it repaired ASAP Based on this Im thinking Im looking at gaming laptops although I dont care about the dGPU at all and would prefer iGPU if possible Given the 8c16t requirement I think I am looking for either an Intel Core i711800H or an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H Ive found a few options but UK availability is terrible ASUS TUF Gaming A15 AMD or F15 Intel Not available from ASUS directly yet in UK Not sure how to get extended warranty unless I buy it directly from ASUS No onsite repair option Max 16GB need to upgrade manually not sure it it comes as 2x8GB or 1x16GB Lenovo Legion 1516 Pro Lenovo do extended onsite warranties yay No options on Lenovo site to upgrade to 32GB Some models have lower capacity battery Options are changing constantly and they never seem to have the right model for me some days there is one in stock next day no stock really hard to actually pin it down and get something in my basket Dell Inspiron 16 Plus Dell do extended onsite warranties yay NotebookCheck review said the performance wasnt as good as other laptops with the 11800H possibly bad cooling design HP Omen Victus series The new series with the 5800H and 11800H are not available yet in UK been waiting for ages for these Havent even seen a review yet although I heard good stuff about their Ryzen 4800H laptops XMGSchenker Based in Europe so Id have to pay import duty and then RTB repairs will take a long time and then would I have to pay duty again At this point Ive been eyeing the options up for a while and Im not sure what to do I know Intel are launching the 12th gen Alder Lake chips in Q4 which I hope would cause manufacturers to shift gear about availability of some of these models I am interested in and hopefully bring prices down as well But it kinda feels like some of these laptops will never see the light day in the UK D So my questions are 1 What other makes and models should I be looking at 2 Do you think any of these unavailable models will materialise before the year is out Thanks for your help",
