        "HP victus 3050ti or legion slim 7i 2060 maxq I dont know enough to make this decision on my own and there are barely any reviews online for the slim 7i I have been using a HP Victus for the past couple of months and only had a couple problems with it the screen hinge is a common issue the battery is fairly good lasting around 7 hours i would like to say but sometimes it breaks loose and will last for about 2 and a half hours the battery percent will sometimes go down 1 percent every minute or so I dont like how there are no ports on the back for when i dock it and the screen is not exactly colour accurate From what i know the tgp is around 75 watts The legion seems like a slight upgrade for me but im not sure I think the 2060 in it is slightly more powerful than the one in the Victus i think a 3050ti is worse than a 2060 im not talking about wattage or variants such as maxq please advise me if i am wrong though the processor in the legion is an i710750H which under my understanding is slightly LESS powerful than an i511400H also tell me if i am wrong about that the legion has a charging port on the back for easier cable routing for docking it has a fingerprint scanner i just think its pretty cool it has an rgb keyboard i think has a better screen that doesnt wobble is significantly lighter i take it to school everyday and i dont like lugging around a weight too much and its very thin The only problem i can see is that it might get hot as it cant cool properly because of it being thin By the way i would like the legion to have windows 11 which it doesnt come with is it bad to upgrade it instead of it being preinstalled Oh also the legion supports usb c charging i think which means that even if the battery goes flat i dont have to lug around a 200 watt charger to school i could just bring around a light usb c charger basically im asking if i should upgrade to the legion and if anyone has any extra info on it that i should know also if someone could tell me what the battery is like that would be great heres the link to the victus and heres the one for the legion also which one do you think looks nicer i cant decide Thanks everyone",
        "Hard time choosing a new laptop So I currently am using a 2020 M1 MacBook Air and am planning on upgrading because A It is not powerful enough and B Windows is far superior to MacOS I am a student and will primarily be using the laptop for school work so it needs to be portable and a comfortable weight to bring with me to and from class I love how portable my 13 Air is Ive done a LOT of research over the past two years but never bit the bullet but I feel like now is the time and so Ive committed to buying one now My use cases in order of importance School Music Production Photoshop Gaming I dont play a lot of games but it would be nice to have a machine to play some Civ 6 or even some other more intensive games like BO2BO3 Zombies and MAYBEEEE some RDR2 when I am on a plane for a long time I want something thats decent on battery life I dont spend all day at school maybe 4 hours at most on a given day so I want something thatll last me that long doing just school work without having to even worry about bringing a charger Now Ive looked at like tens of laptops from gaming to notebook and Ive seen some Ive considered like the Zenbook S16 Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Zenbook 14 Zenbook A14 but Ive narrowed it down to a couple Zephyrus G14G16 The clear winner for me problem is it is just too expensive and the only models that go on sale into my price range are the 4050 G14 and 4060 G16 models which Ive heard may not be worth it They dont go on sale super often and the ones that do are open box Currently can get the 4050 model for 1499 CAD open box Zenbook Duo 2024 Ultra 9 32GB 1TB 60hz 1080p model Ive toyed with the idea of having this laptop for a while My PC setup at home has 3 monitors and I absolutely love it and could see myself getting genuine use out of both screens when writing an assignment key word being WHEN I am doing an assignment which isnt an every day thing I dont think it would be powerful enough to handle any gaming at all Surprisingly this is actually cheaper than both the G14 and G16 Models I would be getting Currently can get it RefurbExcellent for 1519 CAD Legion 5 Gen 10 15 This just came out and I feel like 15 is the perfect size for me to be honest I can get the spec with the Ryzen 7 260 32GB RAM 1TB SSD will add another in the future and a 5060 8GB card for within my price range around 1750 all in Its around 4 pounds which is the heaviest of the three but is also the fastest of the three Its so new that there isnt a single review yet for it Brand new for 1750 CAD could try and haggle it at Lenovo These are my three ideas right now in terms of what to get Does anyone have any recommendations Anyone with these laptops have advice Id not like to spend more than 2000 CAD EDIT In case it wasnt clear this is not meant to be a desktop replacement I already have one",

        "Is this Laptop Good With Black Friday coming up Im planning to buy a laptop with good performance decent dedicated GPU 16GB or more RAM prefer 32GB so that I wont have to upgrade in the near future and at least 512 GB SSD Im an engineering student part freelancer and content creator so the rig will be used for things like CAD simulation software VMs Video Editing video conferencing and recording videos for YT Emphasis on multitasking with other work like coding on an IDE or using Office Most importantly the laptop must run smoothly for at least 5 years while not getting genzoned by future OS updates I have been looking around a lot and have found some good choices among ASUS and Lenovo machines a bit disinclined towards the latter While doing so I came across this Its not a wellknown brand so I dont see many reviews anywhere But it looks like a steal at this price the specs are leagues above the competition compare with the Lenovo Legion Slim 5 But thats whats making me skeptic is there a catch here Like poor longevity battery life or something else Anyone who has any experience please give some valuable insight"

        "500 laptop for school I need to buy a new laptop for school My budget is only 500 absolutely no higher I dont need to be able to game on it I already have a gaming PC and Lenovo Legion Go lol However Im a Mechanical Engineering major so Ill need to be able to run some heavier software like CAD MATLAB other simulation tools etc Portability is also a factor because Ill be taking it back and forth to work with me every day to do coursework in my downtime The only options I can find near me are the ASUS Vivobook with Intel Core 5 120U and the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U Based on reviews online and especially on a Reddit Im scared to pull the trigger on either one now Is there a better option that I havent found yet",
        "I can run the new Diablo 2 resurrectedremaster on this at max graphics no problem as long as its plugged in That game is a little heavier that you would expect on resources My Ryzen 4800u with integrated graphics can only handle about low medium graphics So this things pretty decent Depending on what youre doing keep in mind the battery life is horrible on this thing Im getting worse life than OP when just doing very basic light tasks I get 3 12 to 4 hours max This is with screen brightness low no USB devices the 3050 dGPU disabled and just using a webbrowser No gaming or streaming Ive done all manner of tests to squeeze out better battery life and have had not luck OS reinstall clean different drivers setting max CPU usage to 30 etc Dell support told me 4 hours is good battery life for this laptop and referred to the battery as a backup battery Also if you plan to dual boot to linux this thing wont sleep properly You can set it to suspend which defaults to s2idle and uses about 14 battery per hour Manually modifying the system to deep sleep doesnt work properly it will start to sleep then spin up the fans and turn on the keyboard light This is with Nvidia proprietary driver software and the dGPU off and iGPU on After researching it lots of dell notebooks are doing thing Dells forums show things like this model doesnt support being set to suspendsleep and put in a bookbag Hopefully this info helps Im in the process of returning mine Its a nice enough laptop but averaging 35 hours of battery life from extremally light tasks with my mentioned battery saving attempts is bad the linux sleep thing is bad too If youll mostly be on AC power all day youll be fine But if youre on battery it will not last Gaming will kill the battery even faster and it will lower its performance dropping the frame rate badly on battery",
