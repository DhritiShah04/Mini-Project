        "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 which has been hyped up as the supreme being of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip Im just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively especially when something costs close to 800 This is an honest review no marketing fluff of just reading the specs I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel While I was overall impressed I think this machine is overhyped mainly because of the chip Its not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas Im coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9 with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which EATS UP anything I throw at it AI photovideo editing multi tasking video calls Thats my dream give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises So heres my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week alongside my trusty daily driver the HP Chromebook x360 14c i38GB RAM which is still a beast since 2021 Build Design The Lenovo is thin and light but solid It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality especially when typing Its so light it almost feels like a dummy unit but clearly isnt It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware Only downside The bottom is plastic so it lacks that full premium unibody feel But unless youre carrying it around a lot its a nonissue People mentioned keyboard flex but I didnt experience any in daily use And Im a weightlifter and former lineman with 105inch bear paws I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard The hinge is firm you cant open it with one hand but once open it holds its position perfectly Compared to the HP 14c the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter My HP is a full aluminum tank its been a champ for years The Lenovo feels like itll hold up but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time Build Grade A Battery Life Lets be real I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours But thats OK because I still got a solid 9105 hours under heavy realworld use 2030 tabs open Zoom app Teams web YouTube music streaming Constant typing Screen at 70 Compared to my aging HP which lasts about 45 hours now this is a major win For comparison the HP Dragonfly Pro 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours That thing didnt last the weekend before it went back Battery Grade A Keyboard Trackpad Fingerprint Reader Typing on this was a breeze even with my bear paws No real keyboard flex during regular use The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c but once I got into a groove I had no complaints Trackpad is large smooth and accurate feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness No lag no misclicks The fingerprint reader One of the best Ive used on a Chromebook or any computer I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger but nope still unlocked instantly Grade A Sound Speakers The Dolbybranded speakers had me hopeful but theyre great for a Chromebook but average overall My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water so its nothing special there They do have more depth than 99 of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall its still Chromebook speakers so they are decent in a small room The HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers but again good for a chrombook but in realworld usage they are just ok Grade C overall B for a Chromebook Chip Performance Kompanio Ultra 910 Heres where the hype train slows down In benchmarks Jetstream Speedometer this chip was twice as fast as my HPs i3 In realworld use Not really Its only slightly faster like a 051 second lead in page loads even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets Yes it wins technically but it was often a photo finish I ran into consistent problems using Teams in the browser Video calls would freeze the screen would stutter and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera Reddit confirms Im not alone on this Zoom via app worked fine but Teams was rough No such issues on my HP But the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience as some of the apps would be better on a fullscreen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone I tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called InShot and it temporarily presented a dream come true to have InShot on a laptop not a tablet with an added on keyboard where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15second 4k files and thats when it went to crap fast As soon as I added in a transition it became super laggy and jittery and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam it looks like it should work and has the same shape and characteristics but no it wont do at all AI features like background blur or object removal Not there yet Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets My last point about the chip is why not use past 12 year old true flagship chips that can do it all like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Galaxy Tab S9 series If they are going to charge such a premium price and say its because of the chip bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI multitasking video editing and more all at the same time and then Chrome OS would be a monster Grade B Screen Camera Now this screen WOW Its a 2K OLED panel thats absolutely beautiful I watched an 8K Planet Earth video on Youtube and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it The best screen Ive ever seen on a Chromebook Also they list the Lenovo at 400 nits but it feels much brighter than 400 I kept the screen constantly at 6070 and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases BUT a few things Some imagesweb pages looked oversaturated No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS The camera is also surprisingly good Not Galaxy Ultra good but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting Grade A Final Thoughts This is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks especially with ARM chips The design is sleek though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue the screen is stellar battery is excellent and it handles most tasks with ease For most users who use nothing but web apps Google Docs Office email YouTube this is more than enough People spending 2000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative BUT looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 this would be the nobrainer recommendation of the year for any laptop especially a Chromebook at 500 as 750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for 850 If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months and this goes down to 450550 for a new one run dont walk to get one if you need a new laptop At that price this is the nobrainer Chromebook of the decade Overall Grade B Me and my bear paws are off to test the next device",
        "Great review thanks a lot Very well written and exactly what I was looking for Edit I have one more question How well or poorly does the touch display respond And were you able to test Android games on it Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices Two questions Those were two questions Sorry",

        "Dont buy the Zenbook duo Its more of a gimmick and not a good choice for your use case Gaming laptops all suffer from battery life They always need to be plugged in They dont last long You might want to get something with a modern AMD Ryzen 8000 series CPU The integrated graphics are good for some light gaming These CPU are also power efficient so you get good battery life Asus Zenbook S16 and Zenbook 14 should be the models to consider The models with AMD Ryzen CPUs",
        "It really depends on your criteria on what you need Personally I think Asus is willing to push performance at the cost of quality My shopping criteria for laptops are going to be 13 to 16 laptops equipped with touchscreens convertible 2in1 dedicated GPU equipped systems with upgradeable RAM and M2 Storage using M2 2280 formats x200B Dells got fucking lucky with their DOD contract HPs shitty laptop control hardware and not really meeting my needs MSI bought a bunch but their hinges suck",
        "exact same situation as you the craziest game Ill probably play is genshin lol but I need my laptop to handle at least that plus Im not sure how overall performancehardware would be affected in a convertible"

        "See you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up The Lenovo is fast but the jitters and lag it has when doing realworld stuff are unacceptable for me at that price As I said comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021 they are neck and neck in realworld speed tests but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open playing 4k videos and video calling at the same time Yes the battery life is not great on my older HP but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo just doing what we have come to consider basic things like video calling when the Lenovo about aborted on me I think the Mediatek chip is ok but its not as powerful as they make it seem As I said in my review they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease and then it will be perfect",

the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip Im just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively especially when something costs close to 800 This is an honest review no marketing fluff of just reading the specs I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel While I was overall impressed I think this machine is overhyped mainly because of the chip Its not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas Im coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9 with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which EATS UP anything I throw at it AI photovideo editing multi tasking video calls Thats my dream give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises So heres my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week alongside my trusty daily driver the HP Chromebook x360 14c i38GB RAM which is still a beast since 2021 Build Design The Lenovo is thin and light but solid It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality especially when typing Its so light it almost feels like a dummy unit but clearly isnt It definitely feels like the next

        "is this a good laptop for a long run as a college student lenovo thinkbook 14 gen 7 amd Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Generation 7 AMD Im planning to purchase a new laptop and found this laptop that interest me The laptop specs that I have customized and choose are as follows CPU AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS 8 Cores 16 Threads GPU AMD Radeon 680M RAM 8GB upgradeable until 64GB DDR54800 Storage 512GB Ports SD card reader USBA USB 5Gbps Ethernet RJ45 Kensington Nano Security Slot USBC USB 10Gbps with USB PD 30 DP 14 USBA USB 5Gbps Always On HDMI USBC USB4 40Gbps with USB PD 30 DP 14 Headphone microphone combo jack 35mm Im planning to use this laptop for my computer science studies and continue using it afterward at my workplace as a softwarenetwork engineer The variety of IO ports make it suitable for longterm use imo And from what I heard AMD tends to use less power and less heat which makes the battery life longer compared to Intel cause I need a better battery life for long classes while maintaining a decent amount of power I also plan to play some light games on it definitely not AAA titles Some of the games I have in mind are Cuphead Cult of the Lamb Astroneer No Mans Sky and Fortnite For some reason I havent found many reviews on YouTube about this laptop which is kind of odd So for those who already own it or have experience with it in your opinion is this a good laptop for college and work",
        "My Review of the ASUS VivoBook Flip 14 TM420IADB71T Sorry for the Format as I dont really post but I feel like I have something to contribute as this laptop is still relatively new and not that easy to find Also to clarify I chose the laptop with the ryzen 7 4700u for 699 but there is a 4500u variant for a 100 less But anyways here are the main specs Operating System Windows 10 Home Screen Size 14 FHD 1920 x 1080 glossy CPU AMD Ryzen 7 4700U 2GHz Turbo up to 41GHz RAM 8GB DDR4 Storage 512GB PCIe SSD Bluetooth Bluetooth 42 Dual band 22 Keyboard Backlit Chiclet Keyboard WebCam 720p HD camera Battery 42WHrs 3S1P 3cell Liion Dimensions 128 x 87 x 07 Weight 33 lbs Accessories Stylus First things first although the price may feel tempting this laptop has plenty of issues that I find it hard to recommend On the flip side I will start with the aspects that I did enjoy 1 The display i will admit that this display can be a lot better and the people who like to dismiss this laptop because of the 250 nits brightness and 45 NTSC screen are justified to do so in my opinion since those arent numbers to brag about at all But this display has pleasantly surprised me Unless Im trying to conserve battery or am outside this screen is plenty bright and has nice viewing angles 2 Tablet mode the hinge is not the best and at the bottom of the 360 turns feels a bit loose but I am genuinely enjoying using this 2 in 1 Like I mentioned earlier this display isnt good enough for me to color with I have a color accurate monitor for that but the pen that comes with the laptop is pretty great and doing artwork on it is a breeze Its really easy to switch between apps and with the laptops light weight it doesnt feel like Im lugging a whole ass laptop I have even used tablet mode to just watch my shows up close and it honestly looked great 3 The CPU and RAM I know those are two separate components in the pc but Ill combine them here since theyre both the main drivers of performance in this pc The ryzen 4000 series is great and it handles everything I throw at it It reminds me of the ryzen 7 3700x in my gaming pc The radeon graphics also impressed me and for once I can kind of agree with their line that it can casually game The RAM although starting at a disappointing 8GB at 3200MHZ is something that you can upgrade Which is something you dont see in very many laptops these days Theres only one SODIMM at least from what Ive heard I will be replacing one of the RAM slots in a few days so I may update this post for you to upgrade to so it wont run in dual channel if you do decide to expand the memory And now to move on to the things which I didnt enjoy which will probably be longer than the last 1 I thought it looked alright in picture but in person the chassis feels and looks cheaper than other laptops that are hundreds of dollars less than this laptop Im sure its fine for a lot of people but it is something to keep in mind and be ready for your fingerprint to leave marks everywhere 2 Bloatware not that this is as big of an issue because microsoft does it a lot too but installing over a gb of mcafee antivirus really asus 3 The battery has to be one of the most disappointing things on this laptop The only way to make it last as long as its competitors is to turn the already dim display all the way down turn on battery saver and use one app at a time If youre trying to multitask with the brightness up good luck getting more than 45 hours on a full charge 4 The Keyboard again this isnt as big of an issue but Im not a fan of these keys There was a decent adjustment period getting used to these keys and I think its noteworthy to bring it up I can play tetris at a pretty high level on most devices but this one took an especially long time to get used to it could just be a me issue tho 5 I may have just been unlucky but I also ran into not one but two issues within the first two weeks of using the vivobook First the fingerprint scanner stopped working after a windows update and I have yet to fix the issue actually anyone who wants to dm and try to help Ill appreciate it greatly And secondly possibly a bigger issue if the problem persists but sometimes I cannot turn on the pc without plugging in the power adapter even if theres a decent amount of battery life left Now it hasnt happened in the last couple days but the fact that I had to deal with issues like this with a brand new laptop is kinda infuriating considering the amount of money I spent on it I still plan on keeping this laptop as the cpu ability to upgrade ram and drawing tablet functionality will help me a lot with what I need my computer for However the fact still stands that I have a very hard time recommending this laptop and I think youre better off trying to find a lenovo alternative or shelling out more money for a proper 2 in 1 Edit So I finally upgraded the ram and replaced one of the 4gb sticks with 16gb making the new total ram 20gb running at 3200mhz There really is only one sodimm slot but it really is fine for me A couple of other things to mention are when I opened the laptop there were fingerprints on the back panel that were there from presumably assembly And unlike a lot of laptops I saw on YouTube underneath the cage that houses the ssd and ram theres a thick piece of tape on the ram so be prepared to remove that Only other things I can think to mention in my review is that now that Ive listened to some music on it without my headphones the speakers arent half bad"

        "is this a good laptop for a long run as a college student lenovo thinkbook 14 gen 7 amd Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Generation 7 AMD Im planning to purchase a new laptop and found this laptop that interest me The laptop specs that I have customized and choose are as follows CPU AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS 8 Cores 16 Threads GPU AMD Radeon 680M RAM 8GB upgradeable until 64GB DDR54800 Storage 512GB Ports SD card reader USBA USB 5Gbps Ethernet RJ45 Kensington Nano Security Slot USBC USB 10Gbps with USB PD 30 DP 14 USBA USB 5Gbps Always On HDMI USBC USB4 40Gbps with USB PD 30 DP 14 Headphone microphone combo jack 35mm Im planning to use this laptop for my computer science studies and continue using it afterward at my workplace as a softwarenetwork engineer The variety of IO ports make it suitable for longterm use imo And from what I heard AMD tends to use less power and less heat which makes the battery life longer compared to Intel cause I need a better battery life for long classes while maintaining a decent amount of power I also plan to play some light games on it definitely not AAA titles Some of the games I have in mind are Cuphead Cult of the Lamb Astroneer No Mans Sky and Fortnite For some reason I havent found many reviews on YouTube about this laptop which is kind of odd So for those who already own it or have experience with it in your opinion is this a good laptop for college and work"
