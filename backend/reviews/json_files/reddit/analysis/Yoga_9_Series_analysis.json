        "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v Price Performance The Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 714 performance increase Screen wobbling Some reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room However when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times for example the delete key Mousepad The glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions loudness brightness etc by a asus tool Quality variations The first model had a unproblematic mouspad The 2nd showed the follwing issue When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again the pad bounces up a tiny bit This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating Keyboard The keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example It has not much damping The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment I noticed not much flex only when forcefully pressing on the keys for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb Minor problems The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge Screen The screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 11800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks screen report before calibration screen report after calibration In both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen Speakers The sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass An wow the volume can be turned up to a very high level Noise The only point that was initially a minus was the fan which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do and the sharp spin up is very audible I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the Asus Fan Control V5 allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode Using the Asus Fan Control dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable Fan Control open source software Fingerprints Fingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver Overall As described the lower priced model can be a good priceperformance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption However when looking for a machine for media editingcreation I would reccommend the 32gb version At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards",
        "Yes I have a question Does the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support WakeOnLan in the BIOS I ask because the notebook does not have an RJ45 Ethernet port but Asus provides an accessory 90XB05WNMCA010 which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support WakeOnLan WOL I imagine that by connecting it at least to the USBA port on the left side which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off it should be able to turn on the computer Although such a feature may seem futile for a notebook since I will keep it as a second home PC when not travelling it can be very convenient to manage it at home from the main PC with TeamViewer or similar software I have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV and it is very convenient Thank you",
