        "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 which has been hyped up as the supreme being of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip Im just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively especially when something costs close to 800 This is an honest review no marketing fluff of just reading the specs I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel While I was overall impressed I think this machine is overhyped mainly because of the chip Its not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas Im coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9 with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which EATS UP anything I throw at it AI photovideo editing multi tasking video calls Thats my dream give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises So heres my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week alongside my trusty daily driver the HP Chromebook x360 14c i38GB RAM which is still a beast since 2021 Build Design The Lenovo is thin and light but solid It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality especially when typing Its so light it almost feels like a dummy unit but clearly isnt It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware Only downside The bottom is plastic so it lacks that full premium unibody feel But unless youre carrying it around a lot its a nonissue People mentioned keyboard flex but I didnt experience any in daily use And Im a weightlifter and former lineman with 105inch bear paws I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard The hinge is firm you cant open it with one hand but once open it holds its position perfectly Compared to the HP 14c the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter My HP is a full aluminum tank its been a champ for years The Lenovo feels like itll hold up but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time Build Grade A Battery Life Lets be real I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours But thats OK because I still got a solid 9105 hours under heavy realworld use 2030 tabs open Zoom app Teams web YouTube music streaming Constant typing Screen at 70 Compared to my aging HP which lasts about 45 hours now this is a major win For comparison the HP Dragonfly Pro 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours That thing didnt last the weekend before it went back Battery Grade A Keyboard Trackpad Fingerprint Reader Typing on this was a breeze even with my bear paws No real keyboard flex during regular use The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c but once I got into a groove I had no complaints Trackpad is large smooth and accurate feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness No lag no misclicks The fingerprint reader One of the best Ive used on a Chromebook or any computer I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger but nope still unlocked instantly Grade A Sound Speakers The Dolbybranded speakers had me hopeful but theyre great for a Chromebook but average overall My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water so its nothing special there They do have more depth than 99 of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall its still Chromebook speakers so they are decent in a small room The HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers but again good for a chrombook but in realworld usage they are just ok Grade C overall B for a Chromebook Chip Performance Kompanio Ultra 910 Heres where the hype train slows down In benchmarks Jetstream Speedometer this chip was twice as fast as my HPs i3 In realworld use Not really Its only slightly faster like a 051 second lead in page loads even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets Yes it wins technically but it was often a photo finish I ran into consistent problems using Teams in the browser Video calls would freeze the screen would stutter and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera Reddit confirms Im not alone on this Zoom via app worked fine but Teams was rough No such issues on my HP But the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience as some of the apps would be better on a fullscreen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone I tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called InShot and it temporarily presented a dream come true to have InShot on a laptop not a tablet with an added on keyboard where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15second 4k files and thats when it went to crap fast As soon as I added in a transition it became super laggy and jittery and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam it looks like it should work and has the same shape and characteristics but no it wont do at all AI features like background blur or object removal Not there yet Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets My last point about the chip is why not use past 12 year old true flagship chips that can do it all like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Galaxy Tab S9 series If they are going to charge such a premium price and say its because of the chip bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI multitasking video editing and more all at the same time and then Chrome OS would be a monster Grade B Screen Camera Now this screen WOW Its a 2K OLED panel thats absolutely beautiful I watched an 8K Planet Earth video on Youtube and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it The best screen Ive ever seen on a Chromebook Also they list the Lenovo at 400 nits but it feels much brighter than 400 I kept the screen constantly at 6070 and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases BUT a few things Some imagesweb pages looked oversaturated No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS The camera is also surprisingly good Not Galaxy Ultra good but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting Grade A Final Thoughts This is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks especially with ARM chips The design is sleek though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue the screen is stellar battery is excellent and it handles most tasks with ease For most users who use nothing but web apps Google Docs Office email YouTube this is more than enough People spending 2000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative BUT looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 this would be the nobrainer recommendation of the year for any laptop especially a Chromebook at 500 as 750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for 850 If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months and this goes down to 450550 for a new one run dont walk to get one if you need a new laptop At that price this is the nobrainer Chromebook of the decade Overall Grade B Me and my bear paws are off to test the next device",
        "Great review thanks a lot Very well written and exactly what I was looking for Edit I have one more question How well or poorly does the touch display respond And were you able to test Android games on it Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices Two questions Those were two questions Sorry",
        "Acer Chromebook Plus 714 Review A Monarch in the making for Chromebooks Ive long been a fan of Acer Chromebooks mainly because they were one of the first companies that really took ChromeOS seriously and pushed out multiple devices at different price points so people could actually try the platform out My very first Chromebook back in 2015 was an Acer and Ive owned four Acer Chromebooks since then I loved that original device even with its limitations in RAM and power at the time But Acer has come a long way and now Ive got my hands on the new Acer Chromebook Plus 714 This one comes with a premium build pure power and unexpectedly great battery life Its not a new release but its the best Chrombook Acer makes so I had to check it out as Im on my journey to find the best new Chrombook for me So lets get into it Build Design The design looks sharp It has a premium feel with gold edges against the dark grey finish The body is solid aluminum and it really feels like a toptier machine in hand Inside it switches to plastic but not the cheap kind It feels solid comfortable under your palms and wrists and theres no flex when typing Port selection is solid two USBC ports an HDMI port which should honestly be standard on every laptop a headphone jack another musthave and USBA ports The downside is both USBC ports are on the left side which already caused me an issue with charging since my setup needed a rightside port They could have easily put one on each side and it feels like a miss For a device at this price it should also have a fingerprint scanner standard in my book for anything over 500 especially a Chromebook On the positive side its a 360degree convertible so you can flip it into tablet or tent mode which is surprisingly useful in tight spaces like on a plane But heres the kicker some versions of the 714 come with a builtin stylus and mine didnt That shouldve been standard across all models at this price point Overall Design Build A Battery Life This is always the question that unites man how long does the battery last The Chromebook Plus 714 runs on Intels new Core Ultra 5 115U chip so I was curious how that would balance performance with efficiency My past Chromebooks with i5 chips had horrible battery life At first this one seemed the same barely a few hours and even dying overnight in sleep mode But then after a few days something clicked It optimized itself and the battery life became excellent My normal workflow includes 2030 tabs open Zoom app Teams web meets 45 hours a day Google Messages app YouTube Music streaming Constant typing Brightness around 70 With that it pushes through the day no problem Even now in week 2 I charged it 5 days ago used it an hour or two daily and it still has 43 left Whatever optimization Intel and Acer did here worked because my older HP Chromebook x360 14c with an i3 chip cant even come close Battery Life A Keyboard Trackpad Fingerprint Reader The keyboard is good but not great I have massive bearpaw hands so I judge every keyboard against the HP x360s which still holds the crown for me This one is fine with decent travel and good response but the keys could be just a bit bigger The trackpad is excellent glasslike very responsive accurate and the perfect size It does pick up fingerprints easily but thats par for the course Again no fingerprint reader in 2025 for a device at this price range big miss Keyboard B Trackpad A Sound Speakers Speakers Sound This is where Acer cut corners The speakers are weak tiny and honestly feel like they came out of a firstgen Chromebook No bass not loud and just flat overall Even my phone speakers iPhone or Galaxy blow these out of the water At this price point they should have borrowed the better speakers from their Windows laptops Speakers D Chip Performance Intel Core Ultra 5 115U This is the biggest surprise The new Intel Core Ultra 5 architecture delivers real performance gains in a way I havent seen on a Chromebook before Unlike the new Lenovo Chromebook with the hypedup MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip which stuttered constantly and almost crashed during 4K editing for me this one handled everything I threw at it With 2030 tabs open Teams in the browser Zoom app running and editing 4K video in InShot it was smooth and lagfree Exporting video was fast and transitions text and clip movements were as fluid as they are on my Galaxy Tab S9 This chip also allows you to download all the apps from the Google Play store something I also saw on the Lenovo but to me I get better performance on this one Even with only 8GB of RAM it didnt break a sweat But at this price I still think Acer shouldve put in 16GB for better futureproofing Now benchmarks JetStream and Speedometer only show mild improvements over my older HP x360 14c with an i3 from 2021 which is shocking But in realworld usage this chip feels much more powerful Combined with the strong battery life this is easily one of the best Chromebook chips out right now Performance A Screen Camera The screen is solid with a 1610 aspect ratio crisp visuals accurate colors and good brightness rated at 340 nits more than enough for outdoor use It doesnt quite pop like the Lenovo Chromebook Plus screen that one I really felt like I was there watching an HDR video but its plenty good for work and media The camera though is excellent It feels like using my Logitech webcam on Windows Its AIenhanced sharp in low light and balanced in harsh light Chromebooks used to skimp here but this one really impressed me even rivaling smartphonelevel quality on calls Final Thoughts The Acer Chromebook Plus 714 is a great machine and a clear look at where Chromebooks are headed with Intels Core Ultra chips Its sleek powerful has excellent battery life and handles pretty much anything you throw at it within ChromeOS For most people who live in web apps Docs Gmail YouTube Office this is exactly what you need And honestly people dropping 2000 on email machines should be looking at ChromeOS more seriously But its not perfect The missing fingerprint scanner weak speakers plastic interior and lack of a stylus on all models really hold it back At its original MSRP of 800 it was priced against the MacBook Air and its not quite at that level yet But at 629 and even cheaper for openbox units at Best Buy its an easy recommendation Right now this feels like royalty in the Chromebook lineup Not quite the King yet but very close If they make the changes I mentioned along with overall improvements due to tech available at the time the 714 will easily be crowned King of Chromebooks Overall Grade A Excellent pickup"

        "Thanks so much for the detailed insight Your real world experience with snap is helpful Im not a gamer so that side effect isnt a big issue for me but Ill definitely doublecheck the specific software I need i use vs code and someone mentioned not all plugins are compatible and look into Prism compatibility I went to Officeworks the other day to try out the laptop and I was impressed with its sleek aluminium build The keyboard felt a bit odd to the touch but thats fine since Ill be using an external keyboard anyway I opened around 30 tabsYouTube Reddit news sites job portalsand there was a slight lag which I expected but it didnt heat up and the fans never kicked in which was nice The only letdown was the touchpad It felt premium but it didnt always register my singletap clicks which got a bit frustrating Still Ill be using an external mouse most of the time so its not a dealbreaker for me",
        "To be fair though Starfield is very heavy and doesnt perform especially well on anything Even my desktop with 6700xt 5800x3d cant run the game half as well as it should be able to Not to mention that Starfield runs worse on Nvidia GPUs",
        "I dont see why not 4050 is a beefy GPU relatively speaking The one piece of advice I would give to anyone thinking of buying any laptop with a dedicated GPU is this Make sure to check the wattage that the 4050 is configured at in the specific model you are interested in I dont know the exact range for the 4050 or other RTX 4000 series mobile GPUs but with the 30503050ti for example those can be configured as low as 30w or as high as 95w and the clock speed usually scales with the power draw So a laptop with a 30 or 40 watt configured GPU would perform much worse than one with the full 95 watts for example I doubt that Dell is running the 4050 at full clock speed but you never know until you check the specs list of the laptop"

        "I dont see why not 4050 is a beefy GPU relatively speaking The one piece of advice I would give to anyone thinking of buying any laptop with a dedicated GPU is this Make sure to check the wattage that the 4050 is configured at in the specific model you are interested in I dont know the exact range for the 4050 or other RTX 4000 series mobile GPUs but with the 30503050ti for example those can be configured as low as 30w or as high as 95w and the clock speed usually scales with the power draw So a laptop with a 30 or 40 watt configured GPU would perform much worse than one with the full 95 watts for example I doubt that Dell is running the 4050 at full clock speed but you never know until you check the specs list of the laptop"

        "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 which has been hyped up as the supreme being of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip Im just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively especially when something costs close to 800 This is an honest review no marketing fluff of just reading the specs I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel While I was overall impressed I think this machine is overhyped mainly because of the chip Its not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas Im coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9 with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which EATS UP anything I throw at it AI photovideo editing multi tasking video calls Thats my dream give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises So heres my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week alongside my trusty daily driver the HP Chromebook x360 14c i38GB RAM which is still a beast since 2021 Build Design The Lenovo is thin and light but solid It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality especially when typing Its so light it almost feels like a dummy unit but clearly isnt It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware Only downside The bottom is plastic so it lacks that full premium unibody feel But unless youre carrying it around a lot its a nonissue People mentioned keyboard flex but I didnt experience any in daily use And Im a weightlifter and former lineman with 105inch bear paws I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard The hinge is firm you cant open it with one hand but once open it holds its position perfectly Compared to the HP 14c the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter My HP is a full aluminum tank its been a champ for years The Lenovo feels like itll hold up but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time Build Grade A Battery Life Lets be real I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours But thats OK because I still got a solid 9105 hours under heavy realworld use 2030 tabs open Zoom app Teams web YouTube music streaming Constant typing Screen at 70 Compared to my aging HP which lasts about 45 hours now this is a major win For comparison the HP Dragonfly Pro 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours That thing didnt last the weekend before it went back Battery Grade A Keyboard Trackpad Fingerprint Reader Typing on this was a breeze even with my bear paws No real keyboard flex during regular use The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c but once I got into a groove I had no complaints Trackpad is large smooth and accurate feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness No lag no misclicks The fingerprint reader One of the best Ive used on a Chromebook or any computer I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger but nope still unlocked instantly Grade A Sound Speakers The Dolbybranded speakers had me hopeful but theyre great for a Chromebook but average overall My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water so its nothing special there They do have more depth than 99 of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall its still Chromebook speakers so they are decent in a small room The HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers but again good for a chrombook but in realworld usage they are just ok Grade C overall B for a Chromebook Chip Performance Kompanio Ultra 910 Heres where the hype train slows down In benchmarks Jetstream Speedometer this chip was twice as fast as my HPs i3 In realworld use Not really Its only slightly faster like a 051 second lead in page loads even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets Yes it wins technically but it was often a photo finish I ran into consistent problems using Teams in the browser Video calls would freeze the screen would stutter and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera Reddit confirms Im not alone on this Zoom via app worked fine but Teams was rough No such issues on my HP But the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience as some of the apps would be better on a fullscreen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone I tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called InShot and it temporarily presented a dream come true to have InShot on a laptop not a tablet with an added on keyboard where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15second 4k files and thats when it went to crap fast As soon as I added in a transition it became super laggy and jittery and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam it looks like it should work and has the same shape and characteristics but no it wont do at all AI features like background blur or object removal Not there yet Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets My last point about the chip is why not use past 12 year old true flagship chips that can do it all like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Galaxy Tab S9 series If they are going to charge such a premium price and say its because of the chip bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI multitasking video editing and more all at the same time and then Chrome OS would be a monster Grade B Screen Camera Now this screen WOW Its a 2K OLED panel thats absolutely beautiful I watched an 8K Planet Earth video on Youtube and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it The best screen Ive ever seen on a Chromebook Also they list the Lenovo at 400 nits but it feels much brighter than 400 I kept the screen constantly at 6070 and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases BUT a few things Some imagesweb pages looked oversaturated No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS The camera is also surprisingly good Not Galaxy Ultra good but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting Grade A Final Thoughts This is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks especially with ARM chips The design is sleek though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue the screen is stellar battery is excellent and it handles most tasks with ease For most users who use nothing but web apps Google Docs Office email YouTube this is more than enough People spending 2000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative BUT looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 this would be the nobrainer recommendation of the year for any laptop especially a Chromebook at 500 as 750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for 850 If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months and this goes down to 450550 for a new one run dont walk to get one if you need a new laptop At that price this is the nobrainer Chromebook of the decade Overall Grade B Me and my bear paws are off to test the next device",
        "See you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up The Lenovo is fast but the jitters and lag it has when doing realworld stuff are unacceptable for me at that price As I said comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021 they are neck and neck in realworld speed tests but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open playing 4k videos and video calling at the same time Yes the battery life is not great on my older HP but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo just doing what we have come to consider basic things like video calling when the Lenovo about aborted on me I think the Mediatek chip is ok but its not as powerful as they make it seem As I said in my review they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease and then it will be perfect",
        "Acer Chromebook Plus 714 Review A Monarch in the making for Chromebooks Ive long been a fan of Acer Chromebooks mainly because they were one of the first companies that really took ChromeOS seriously and pushed out multiple devices at different price points so people could actually try the platform out My very first Chromebook back in 2015 was an Acer and Ive owned four Acer Chromebooks since then I loved that original device even with its limitations in RAM and power at the time But Acer has come a long way and now Ive got my hands on the new Acer Chromebook Plus 714 This one comes with a premium build pure power and unexpectedly great battery life Its not a new release but its the best Chrombook Acer makes so I had to check it out as Im on my journey to find the best new Chrombook for me So lets get into it Build Design The design looks sharp It has a premium feel with gold edges against the dark grey finish The body is solid aluminum and it really feels like a toptier machine in hand Inside it switches to plastic but not the cheap kind It feels solid comfortable under your palms and wrists and theres no flex when typing Port selection is solid two USBC ports an HDMI port which should honestly be standard on every laptop a headphone jack another musthave and USBA ports The downside is both USBC ports are on the left side which already caused me an issue with charging since my setup needed a rightside port They could have easily put one on each side and it feels like a miss For a device at this price it should also have a fingerprint scanner standard in my book for anything over 500 especially a Chromebook On the positive side its a 360degree convertible so you can flip it into tablet or tent mode which is surprisingly useful in tight spaces like on a plane But heres the kicker some versions of the 714 come with a builtin stylus and mine didnt That shouldve been standard across all models at this price point Overall Design Build A Battery Life This is always the question that unites man how long does the battery last The Chromebook Plus 714 runs on Intels new Core Ultra 5 115U chip so I was curious how that would balance performance with efficiency My past Chromebooks with i5 chips had horrible battery life At first this one seemed the same barely a few hours and even dying overnight in sleep mode But then after a few days something clicked It optimized itself and the battery life became excellent My normal workflow includes 2030 tabs open Zoom app Teams web meets 45 hours a day Google Messages app YouTube Music streaming Constant typing Brightness around 70 With that it pushes through the day no problem Even now in week 2 I charged it 5 days ago used it an hour or two daily and it still has 43 left Whatever optimization Intel and Acer did here worked because my older HP Chromebook x360 14c with an i3 chip cant even come close Battery Life A Keyboard Trackpad Fingerprint Reader The keyboard is good but not great I have massive bearpaw hands so I judge every keyboard against the HP x360s which still holds the crown for me This one is fine with decent travel and good response but the keys could be just a bit bigger The trackpad is excellent glasslike very responsive accurate and the perfect size It does pick up fingerprints easily but thats par for the course Again no fingerprint reader in 2025 for a device at this price range big miss Keyboard B Trackpad A Sound Speakers Speakers Sound This is where Acer cut corners The speakers are weak tiny and honestly feel like they came out of a firstgen Chromebook No bass not loud and just flat overall Even my phone speakers iPhone or Galaxy blow these out of the water At this price point they should have borrowed the better speakers from their Windows laptops Speakers D Chip Performance Intel Core Ultra 5 115U This is the biggest surprise The new Intel Core Ultra 5 architecture delivers real performance gains in a way I havent seen on a Chromebook before Unlike the new Lenovo Chromebook with the hypedup MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip which stuttered constantly and almost crashed during 4K editing for me this one handled everything I threw at it With 2030 tabs open Teams in the browser Zoom app running and editing 4K video in InShot it was smooth and lagfree Exporting video was fast and transitions text and clip movements were as fluid as they are on my Galaxy Tab S9 This chip also allows you to download all the apps from the Google Play store something I also saw on the Lenovo but to me I get better performance on this one Even with only 8GB of RAM it didnt break a sweat But at this price I still think Acer shouldve put in 16GB for better futureproofing Now benchmarks JetStream and Speedometer only show mild improvements over my older HP x360 14c with an i3 from 2021 which is shocking But in realworld usage this chip feels much more powerful Combined with the strong battery life this is easily one of the best Chromebook chips out right now Performance A Screen Camera The screen is solid with a 1610 aspect ratio crisp visuals accurate colors and good brightness rated at 340 nits more than enough for outdoor use It doesnt quite pop like the Lenovo Chromebook Plus screen that one I really felt like I was there watching an HDR video but its plenty good for work and media The camera though is excellent It feels like using my Logitech webcam on Windows Its AIenhanced sharp in low light and balanced in harsh light Chromebooks used to skimp here but this one really impressed me even rivaling smartphonelevel quality on calls Final Thoughts The Acer Chromebook Plus 714 is a great machine and a clear look at where Chromebooks are headed with Intels Core Ultra chips Its sleek powerful has excellent battery life and handles pretty much anything you throw at it within ChromeOS For most people who live in web apps Docs Gmail YouTube Office this is exactly what you need And honestly people dropping 2000 on email machines should be looking at ChromeOS more seriously But its not perfect The missing fingerprint scanner weak speakers plastic interior and lack of a stylus on all models really hold it back At its original MSRP of 800 it was priced against the MacBook Air and its not quite at that level yet But at 629 and even cheaper for openbox units at Best Buy its an easy recommendation Right now this feels like royalty in the Chromebook lineup Not quite the King yet but very close If they make the changes I mentioned along with overall improvements due to tech available at the time the 714 will easily be crowned King of Chromebooks Overall Grade A Excellent pickup"

firm you cant open it with one hand but once open it holds its position perfectly Compared to the HP 14c the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter My HP is a full aluminum tank its been a champ for years The Lenovo feels like itll hold up but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time Build Grade A Battery Life Lets be real I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours But thats OK because I still got a solid 9105 hours under heavy realworld use 2030 tabs open Zoom app Teams web YouTube music streaming Constant typing Screen at 70 Compared to my aging HP which lasts about 45 hours now this is a major win For comparison the HP Dragonfly Pro 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours That thing didnt last the weekend before it went back Battery Grade A Keyboard Trackpad Fingerprint Reader Typing on this was a breeze even with my bear paws No real keyboard flex during regular use The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c but once I got into a groove I had no complaints Trackpad is large smooth and accurate feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness No lag no misclicks The fingerprint reader One of the best Ive used on a Chromebook or any computer I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger but nope still unlocked instantly Grade A Sound Speakers The Dolbybranded speakers had me hopeful but theyre great for a Chromebook but average overall My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water so its nothing special there They do have more depth than 99 of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall its still Chromebook speakers so they are decent in a small room The HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers but again good for a chrombook but in realworld usage they are just ok Grade C overall B for a Chromebook Chip Performance Kompanio Ultra 910 Heres where the hype train slows down In benchmarks Jetstream Speedometer this chip was twice as fast as my HPs i3 In realworld use Not really Its only slightly faster like a 051 second lead in page loads even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets Yes it wins technically but it was often a photo finish I ran into consistent problems using Teams in the browser Video calls would freeze the screen would stutter and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera Reddit confirms Im not alone on this Zoom via app worked fine but Teams was rough No such issues on my HP But the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience as some of the apps would be better on a fullscreen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone I tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called InShot and it temporarily presented a dream come true to have InShot on a laptop not a tablet with an added on keyboard where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15second 4k files and thats when it went to crap fast As soon as I added in a transition it became super laggy and jittery and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam it looks like it should work and has the same shape and characteristics but no it wont do at all AI features like background blur or object removal Not there yet Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets My last point about the chip is why not use past 12 year old true flagship chips that can do it all like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Galaxy Tab S9 series If they are going to charge such a premium price and say its because of the chip bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI multitasking video editing and more all at the same time and then Chrome OS would be a monster Grade B Screen Camera Now this screen WOW Its a 2K OLED panel thats absolutely beautiful I watched an 8K Planet Earth video on Youtube and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it The best screen Ive ever seen on a Chromebook Also they list the Lenovo at 400 nits but it feels much brighter than 400 I kept the screen constantly at 6070 and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases BUT a few things Some imagesweb pages looked oversaturated No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS The camera is also surprisingly good Not Galaxy Ultra good but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting Grade A Final Thoughts This is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks especially with ARM chips The design is sleek though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue the screen is stellar battery is excellent and it handles most tasks with ease For most users who use nothing but web apps Google Docs Office email YouTube this is more than enough People spending 2000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative BUT looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 this would be the nobrainer recommendation of the year for any laptop especially a Chromebook at 500 as 750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for 850 If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months and this goes down to 450550 for a new one run dont walk to get one if you need a new laptop At that price this is the nobrainer Chromebook of the decade Overall Grade B Me and my bear paws are off to test the next device",
        "Acer Chromebook Plus 714 Review A Monarch in the making for Chromebooks Ive long been a fan of Acer Chromebooks mainly because they were one of the first companies that really took ChromeOS seriously and pushed out multiple devices at different price points so people could actually try the platform out My very first Chromebook back in 2015 was an Acer and Ive owned four Acer Chromebooks since then I loved that original device even with its limitations in RAM and power at the time But Acer has come a long way and now Ive got my hands on the new Acer Chromebook Plus 714 This one comes with a premium build pure power and unexpectedly great battery life Its not a new release but its the best Chrombook Acer makes so I had to check it out as Im on my journey to find the best new Chrombook for me So lets get into it Build Design The design looks sharp It has a premium feel with gold edges against the dark grey finish The body is solid aluminum and it really feels like a toptier machine in hand Inside it switches to plastic but not the cheap kind It feels solid comfortable under your palms and wrists and theres no flex when typing Port selection is solid two USBC ports an HDMI port which should honestly be standard on every laptop a headphone jack another musthave and USBA ports The downside is both USBC ports are on the left side which already caused me an issue with charging since my setup needed a rightside port They could have easily put one on each side and it feels like a miss For a device at this price it should also have a fingerprint scanner standard in my book for anything over 500 especially a Chromebook On the positive side its a 360degree convertible so you can flip it into tablet or tent mode which is surprisingly useful in tight spaces like on a plane But heres the kicker some versions of the 714 come with a builtin stylus and mine didnt That shouldve been standard across all models at this price point Overall Design Build A Battery Life This is always the question that unites man how long does the battery last The Chromebook Plus 714 runs on Intels new Core Ultra 5 115U chip so I was curious how that would balance performance with efficiency My past Chromebooks with i5 chips had horrible battery life At first this one seemed the same barely a few hours and even dying overnight in sleep mode But then after a few days something clicked It optimized itself and the battery life became excellent My normal workflow includes 2030 tabs open Zoom app Teams web meets 45 hours a day Google Messages app YouTube Music streaming Constant typing Brightness around 70 With that it pushes through the day no problem Even now in week 2 I charged it 5 days ago used it an hour or two daily and it still has 43 left Whatever optimization Intel and Acer did here worked because my older HP Chromebook x360 14c with an i3 chip cant even come close Battery Life A Keyboard Trackpad Fingerprint Reader The keyboard is good but not great I have massive bearpaw hands so I judge every keyboard against the HP x360s which still holds the crown for me This one is fine with decent travel and good response but the keys could be just a bit bigger The trackpad is excellent glasslike very responsive accurate and the perfect size It does pick up fingerprints easily but thats par for the course Again no fingerprint reader in 2025 for a device at this price range big miss Keyboard B Trackpad A Sound Speakers Speakers Sound This is where Acer cut corners The speakers are weak tiny and honestly feel like they came out of a firstgen Chromebook No bass not loud and just flat overall Even my phone speakers iPhone or Galaxy blow these out of the water At this price point they should have borrowed the better speakers from their Windows laptops Speakers D Chip Performance Intel Core Ultra 5 115U This is the biggest surprise The new Intel Core Ultra 5 architecture delivers real performance gains in a way I havent seen on a Chromebook before Unlike the new Lenovo Chromebook with the hypedup MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip which stuttered constantly and almost crashed during 4K editing for me this one handled everything I threw at it With 2030 tabs open Teams in the browser Zoom app running and editing 4K video in InShot it was smooth and lagfree Exporting video was fast and transitions text and clip movements were as fluid as they are on my Galaxy Tab S9 This chip also allows you to download all the apps from the Google Play store something I also saw on the Lenovo but to me I get better performance on this one Even with only 8GB of RAM it didnt break a sweat But at this price I still think Acer shouldve put in 16GB for better futureproofing Now benchmarks JetStream and Speedometer only show mild improvements over my older HP x360 14c with an i3 from 2021 which is shocking But in realworld usage this chip feels much more powerful Combined with the strong battery life this is easily one of the best Chromebook chips out right now Performance A Screen Camera The screen is solid with a 1610 aspect ratio crisp visuals accurate colors and good brightness rated at 340 nits more than enough for outdoor use It doesnt quite pop like the Lenovo Chromebook Plus screen that one I really felt like I was there watching an HDR video but its plenty good for work and media The camera though is excellent It feels like using my Logitech webcam on Windows Its AIenhanced sharp in low light and balanced in harsh light Chromebooks used to skimp here but this one really impressed me even rivaling smartphonelevel quality on calls Final Thoughts The Acer Chromebook Plus 714 is a great machine and a clear look at where Chromebooks are headed with Intels Core Ultra chips Its sleek powerful has excellent battery life and handles pretty much anything you throw at it within ChromeOS For most people who live in web apps Docs Gmail YouTube Office this is exactly what you need And honestly people dropping 2000 on email machines should be looking at ChromeOS more seriously But its not perfect The missing fingerprint scanner weak speakers plastic interior and lack of a stylus on all models really hold it back At its original MSRP of 800 it was priced against the MacBook Air and its not quite at that level yet But at 629 and even cheaper for openbox units at Best Buy its an easy recommendation Right now this feels like royalty in the Chromebook lineup Not quite the King yet but very close If they make the changes I mentioned along with overall improvements due to tech available at the time the 714 will easily be crowned King of Chromebooks Overall Grade A Excellent pickup",
        "Thank you for sharing so much useful info Im signing up for Reddit to post this reply One possible reason for what you observed could be Intel Quicksync doing some of the decodeencode assist A quick way to validate is to turn iGPU off in bios or device manager Another reason as you touched on in the comments is Premier optimization Davinci Resolve Studio is much better at unleashing full GPU horse power Do you mind sharing which raw codec do you work with Also if you can post some Pudget benchmarks that would be really cool and standardized they split by transcoding and effects etc Thanks again for your post"

        "Thanks so much for the detailed insight Your real world experience with snap is helpful Im not a gamer so that side effect isnt a big issue for me but Ill definitely doublecheck the specific software I need i use vs code and someone mentioned not all plugins are compatible and look into Prism compatibility I went to Officeworks the other day to try out the laptop and I was impressed with its sleek aluminium build The keyboard felt a bit odd to the touch but thats fine since Ill be using an external keyboard anyway I opened around 30 tabsYouTube Reddit news sites job portalsand there was a slight lag which I expected but it didnt heat up and the fans never kicked in which was nice The only letdown was the touchpad It felt premium but it didnt always register my singletap clicks which got a bit frustrating Still Ill be using an external mouse most of the time so its not a dealbreaker for me",
        "Hi I just ordered an Omnibook Ultra Flip and it will arrive in 3 days But after reading this review Im kind of worried Do you know if the software issues have improved I read that you even had to return it Im really afraid of getting disappointed right now"
