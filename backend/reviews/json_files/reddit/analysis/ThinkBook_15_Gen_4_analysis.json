        "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 which has been hyped up as the supreme being of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip Im just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively especially when something costs close to 800 This is an honest review no marketing fluff of just reading the specs I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel While I was overall impressed I think this machine is overhyped mainly because of the chip Its not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas Im coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9 with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which EATS UP anything I throw at it AI photovideo editing multi tasking video calls Thats my dream give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises So heres my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week alongside my trusty daily driver the HP Chromebook x360 14c i38GB RAM which is still a beast since 2021 Build Design The Lenovo is thin and light but solid It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality especially when typing Its so light it almost feels like a dummy unit but clearly isnt It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware Only downside The bottom is plastic so it lacks that full premium unibody feel But unless youre carrying it around a lot its a nonissue People mentioned keyboard flex but I didnt experience any in daily use And Im a weightlifter and former lineman with 105inch bear paws I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard The hinge is firm you cant open it with one hand but once open it holds its position perfectly Compared to the HP 14c the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter My HP is a full aluminum tank its been a champ for years The Lenovo feels like itll hold up but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time Build Grade A Battery Life Lets be real I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours But thats OK because I still got a solid 9105 hours under heavy realworld use 2030 tabs open Zoom app Teams web YouTube music streaming Constant typing Screen at 70 Compared to my aging HP which lasts about 45 hours now this is a major win For comparison the HP Dragonfly Pro 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours That thing didnt last the weekend before it went back Battery Grade A Keyboard Trackpad Fingerprint Reader Typing on this was a breeze even with my bear paws No real keyboard flex during regular use The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c but once I got into a groove I had no complaints Trackpad is large smooth and accurate feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness No lag no misclicks The fingerprint reader One of the best Ive used on a Chromebook or any computer I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger but nope still unlocked instantly Grade A Sound Speakers The Dolbybranded speakers had me hopeful but theyre great for a Chromebook but average overall My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water so its nothing special there They do have more depth than 99 of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall its still Chromebook speakers so they are decent in a small room The HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers but again good for a chrombook but in realworld usage they are just ok Grade C overall B for a Chromebook Chip Performance Kompanio Ultra 910 Heres where the hype train slows down In benchmarks Jetstream Speedometer this chip was twice as fast as my HPs i3 In realworld use Not really Its only slightly faster like a 051 second lead in page loads even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets Yes it wins technically but it was often a photo finish I ran into consistent problems using Teams in the browser Video calls would freeze the screen would stutter and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera Reddit confirms Im not alone on this Zoom via app worked fine but Teams was rough No such issues on my HP But the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience as some of the apps would be better on a fullscreen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone I tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called InShot and it temporarily presented a dream come true to have InShot on a laptop not a tablet with an added on keyboard where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15second 4k files and thats when it went to crap fast As soon as I added in a transition it became super laggy and jittery and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam it looks like it should work and has the same shape and characteristics but no it wont do at all AI features like background blur or object removal Not there yet Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets My last point about the chip is why not use past 12 year old true flagship chips that can do it all like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Galaxy Tab S9 series If they are going to charge such a premium price and say its because of the chip bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI multitasking video editing and more all at the same time and then Chrome OS would be a monster Grade B Screen Camera Now this screen WOW Its a 2K OLED panel thats absolutely beautiful I watched an 8K Planet Earth video on Youtube and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it The best screen Ive ever seen on a Chromebook Also they list the Lenovo at 400 nits but it feels much brighter than 400 I kept the screen constantly at 6070 and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases BUT a few things Some imagesweb pages looked oversaturated No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS The camera is also surprisingly good Not Galaxy Ultra good but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting Grade A Final Thoughts This is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks especially with ARM chips The design is sleek though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue the screen is stellar battery is excellent and it handles most tasks with ease For most users who use nothing but web apps Google Docs Office email YouTube this is more than enough People spending 2000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative BUT looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 this would be the nobrainer recommendation of the year for any laptop especially a Chromebook at 500 as 750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for 850 If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months and this goes down to 450550 for a new one run dont walk to get one if you need a new laptop At that price this is the nobrainer Chromebook of the decade Overall Grade B Me and my bear paws are off to test the next device",
        "Great review thanks a lot Very well written and exactly what I was looking for Edit I have one more question How well or poorly does the touch display respond And were you able to test Android games on it Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices Two questions Those were two questions Sorry",
        "Need help choosing a laptop Im a student on a tight budget looking for a highperformance beast laptop Ive shortlisted a few models but reviews are mixed each has pros and cons If youve used any of these please share your experience and suggest better options in this price range if you know any Laptops i have shortlisted so far 1 Lenovo loq 12th gen Intel i5 12450hx variant 2 Asus vivobook 16x 13th gen Intel 15 13420h variant 3 Asus tuf gaming a15 Ryzen 7 7435hs variant 4 Acer alg intel i5 13th gen 13420h varient 5 Lenovo thinkbook 16 g6 Ryzen 5 Ps Im from India"

        "Dont buy the Zenbook duo Its more of a gimmick and not a good choice for your use case Gaming laptops all suffer from battery life They always need to be plugged in They dont last long You might want to get something with a modern AMD Ryzen 8000 series CPU The integrated graphics are good for some light gaming These CPU are also power efficient so you get good battery life Asus Zenbook S16 and Zenbook 14 should be the models to consider The models with AMD Ryzen CPUs"

        "See you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up The Lenovo is fast but the jitters and lag it has when doing realworld stuff are unacceptable for me at that price As I said comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021 they are neck and neck in realworld speed tests but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open playing 4k videos and video calling at the same time Yes the battery life is not great on my older HP but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo just doing what we have come to consider basic things like video calling when the Lenovo about aborted on me I think the Mediatek chip is ok but its not as powerful as they make it seem As I said in my review they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease and then it will be perfect",

        "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 which has been hyped up as the supreme being of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip Im just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively especially when something costs close to 800 This is an honest review no marketing fluff of just reading the specs I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel While I was overall impressed I think this machine is overhyped mainly because of the chip Its not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas Im coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9 with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which EATS UP anything I throw at it AI photovideo editing multi tasking video calls Thats my dream give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises So heres my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week alongside my trusty daily driver the HP Chromebook x360 14c i38GB RAM which is still a beast since 2021 Build Design The Lenovo is thin and light but solid It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality especially when typing Its so light it almost feels like a dummy unit but clearly isnt It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware Only downside The bottom is plastic so it lacks that full premium unibody feel But unless youre carrying it around a lot its a nonissue People mentioned keyboard flex but I didnt experience any in daily use And Im a weightlifter and former lineman with 105inch bear paws I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard The hinge is firm you cant open it with one hand but once open it holds its position perfectly Compared to the HP 14c the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter My HP is a full aluminum tank its been a champ for years The Lenovo feels like itll hold up but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time Build Grade A Battery Life Lets be real I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours But thats OK because I still got a solid 9105 hours under heavy realworld use 2030 tabs open Zoom app Teams web YouTube music streaming Constant typing Screen at 70 Compared to my aging HP which lasts about 45 hours now this is a major win For comparison the HP Dragonfly Pro 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours That thing didnt last the weekend before it went back Battery Grade A Keyboard Trackpad Fingerprint Reader Typing on this was a breeze even with my bear paws No real keyboard flex during regular use The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c but once I got into a groove I had no complaints Trackpad is large smooth and accurate feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness No lag no misclicks The fingerprint reader One of the best Ive used on a Chromebook or any computer I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger but nope still unlocked instantly Grade A Sound Speakers The Dolbybranded speakers had me hopeful but theyre great for a Chromebook but average overall My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water so its nothing special there They do have more depth than 99 of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall its still Chromebook speakers so they are decent in a small room The HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers but again good for a chrombook but in realworld usage they are just ok Grade C overall B for a Chromebook Chip Performance Kompanio Ultra 910 Heres where the hype train slows down In benchmarks Jetstream Speedometer this chip was twice as fast as my HPs i3 In realworld use Not really Its only slightly faster like a 051 second lead in page loads even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets Yes it wins technically but it was often a photo finish I ran into consistent problems using Teams in the browser Video calls would freeze the screen would stutter and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera Reddit confirms Im not alone on this Zoom via app worked fine but Teams was rough No such issues on my HP But the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience as some of the apps would be better on a fullscreen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone I tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called InShot and it temporarily presented a dream come true to have InShot on a laptop not a tablet with an added on keyboard where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15second 4k files and thats when it went to crap fast As soon as I added in a transition it became super laggy and jittery and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam it looks like it should work and has the same shape and characteristics but no it wont do at all AI features like background blur or object removal Not there yet Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets My last point about the chip is why not use past 12 year old true flagship chips that can do it all like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Galaxy Tab S9 series If they are going to charge such a premium price and say its because of the chip bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI multitasking video editing and more all at the same time and then Chrome OS would be a monster Grade B Screen Camera Now this screen WOW Its a 2K OLED panel thats absolutely beautiful I watched an 8K Planet Earth video on Youtube and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it The best screen Ive ever seen on a Chromebook Also they list the Lenovo at 400 nits but it feels much brighter than 400 I kept the screen constantly at 6070 and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases BUT a few things Some imagesweb pages looked oversaturated No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS The camera is also surprisingly good Not Galaxy Ultra good but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting Grade A Final Thoughts This is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks especially with ARM chips The design is sleek though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue the screen is stellar battery is excellent and it handles most tasks with ease For most users who use nothing but web apps Google Docs Office email YouTube this is more than enough People spending 2000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative BUT looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 this would be the nobrainer recommendation of the year for any laptop especially a Chromebook at 500 as 750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for 850 If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months and this goes down to 450550 for a new one run dont walk to get one if you need a new laptop At that price this is the nobrainer Chromebook of the decade Overall Grade B Me and my bear paws are off to test the next device",
        "Confused between two Which one among the two should I get is the price increase of 3000 INR 35 justified Intel version is about 55000 INR 630 and Amd is about 58000 INR 670 Also as one of them doesnt have Windows and MS Office I can just get its key for cheap online I chose these as they have extra slot for Ram and Ssd expansion Will be using this laptop for 45 yrs I need it for my college MBA so no coding and all also I rarely play any game will use it for watching movie and college work only I know one is U series and another is HS series both will have different performance but is the performance worth battery drain for my purpose Also is that Amd 5 7535HS processor good",
        "HP Dragonfly Review 16GB 4k 1TB version Ive been looking to shift to a hybrid2 in 1 for some time now I was hoping that would be with Apple but well all know where that has gone Maybe it will change with Apples switch to ARM but with Apples attitude to what customer want I probably had more chance of falling pregnant through wind pollination I generally write in a light hearted manner so if youre easy insulted please stop here Chances are if Ive written something to offend you its probably my weak attempt at humour For those looking at the context of my switch Ill give you my background including my experience with my first attempt at a windows switch Its long and probably somewhat boring so if you want to skip it go to the end of the next section and save yourself the time If youre bored with nothing better to do feel free to plod on I was too lazy to clean it or spend too much time on photos so I apologise in advance for the lack of ultrabook hardware porn x200B My History with Apple and Microsoft Skip this if youre easily bored A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away Australia I decided to give Microsoft a go after more than 10 years on Mac just to see what hybrids were like I purchased a Surface Pro 3 Lets just say it was a huge mistake or it was for me Windows 8 was terrible as a tablet and desktop operation system and when I upgraded to Windows 10 I regretted the decision further The first versions of windows 10 were unstable resulting in a terrible user experience It was sluggish search didnt work properly It had promise but my biggest concern was that if Microsoft would release a half baked product like this what were future releases going to be like Basic problems existed like having to change my display scaling or resolution when I moved from using an external display to the surface display I think the final nail in the coffin was when Microsoft decided to switch on automatic updates where it used your machine to update other machines globally and failed to tell users about what they were doing I lost 300 of mobile data the first day and another 200 on the second before I found the problem Yes data in Australia was that expensive those days I complained to Microsoft Australia they couldnt even be bothered to respond It took 6 months of follows up to even get them to email back to my complaint and believe it or not their actual response was what do you expect us to do How about a apology for one By that stage Id sold my Surface Pro 3 and purchased a quad core MacBook Pro 15 From there I extended my Mac acquisition with Macbook Pro 13 as a lightweight machine for business travel and an iPad Pro which I used for note taking mark ups with the Apple pencil which I loved For a period I was happy like most marriages it knew there were compromises I still lived in hope that Apple would produce a hybrid so I didnt have to lug around two devices The cracks in my relationship started to appear progressively when Apple progressively removed all upgrade capability and when it got to a point of making iMac drives nonuser replaceable I was starting to beat my chest like an angry 5 year old Its a desktop why the hell would you make the drives nonreplaceable other than ripping off the consumer by facing them to upgrade I was planning on the new Mac Pro when Apple released a 7000 screen with a 1000 stand alongside a stupidly overpriced 7000 Mac Pro that came with a 256 GB drive What the They produced a screen for the 12 I knew there had always been an Apple tax but now it had shifted to an idiot tax With the sad realisation that the Apple execs had taken one too many million dollar paychecks and were clearly spending more time snorting cocaine off hookers than working on a realistic to go market strategy for customers like me I decided to depart MacLand and move to the potentially greener pastures of Windowland The first step in my departure was a desktop to replace my 5 year old quad core Mac I built a stupidly powerful desktop for about 5000 RAID Gen 4 S5Ds Ryzen 9 etc I wont bore you more than that suffice to say I could probably hack Pornhub with it why do people always want to hack the Pentagon if I knew how to hack Part two was the replacement of my 2018 Macbook Pro 13 and my iPad Pro which werent necessarily due for replacement I didnt have to replace them but I were in lock down and I dont feel like having multiple operating systems x200B x200B My evaluation criteria I wanted an exec level compact laptop that still had enough power to handle some of my creative requirements The devices I evaluated at the time were Lenovo Yoga X1 Gen 4 Lenovo Yoga X1 Gen 5 HP spectre X360 Dell XPS 13 2 in 1 HP Dragonfly MS Surface Book 3 I ruled out the Surface Book 3 no 4k no LTE no USBC and the Yoga X1 Gen 5 no 4K in Australia as I had some timeline constraints Timeline constraints are the same reason I didnt wait for the 5G Dragonfly I ruled out the Spectre which isnt available in the LTE model if you want a 4k Screen While LTE wasnt mandatory I figured I already had the Dragonfly from HP with it The performance differences between the 8th and 10th gen werent huge I could technically have ruled out the XPS but I decided to try all 3 The Dragonfly was a little harder to find in a store but a friend had been issued one by his company Ultimately my evaluation looked something like this Construction Pretty good for all 3 but the Dragonfly just took it Keyboard Lenovo Dragonfly wasnt as far off as I expected Screen Dragonfly Weight Dragonfly Battery Dragonfly The Dell surprisingly enough didnt stand out in any categories I know this will probably piss off some Dell but its just my perspective x200B Design construction In the box you get Dragonfly Charger Pen and pen charger Usual paper crap warranties the kid of stuff you never read unless there is a problem Coming from Apple gear Im used to aesthetically pleasing designs and carrying 400 adapters Like it or not Apple has been good at it Its also an area where many Windows laptops traditionally suffered The Dragonfly is targeted more at executive levels Yeah you know those hypocrites at the top who skimp on your toilet paper quality to save 100 for the whole building but spend a fortune on a top of the range laptop despite only using it for email As a result looks are somewhere between a Margot Robbie and Chris Hemsworth depending on your sexual preference Absolutely beautiful The blue is hard to describe almost iridescent amazing Combined with the silver logo it has looks to die for so youre getting the bad ass version of Margot Robbie in Suicide Squad I think this has to be one of best looking laptops on the market The photos dont do it justice I liked the blue so much that I couldnt put a grey mouse with it so I hunted down a teal blue version of my Logitech MX 2S I dont match mice but this laptop has driven me to match mice What has happened to me Overall its hard not to give it 10 out 10 for the looks except in a moment or two of insanity HP did something so idiotic you have to question what they were thinking In somewhat of a what the that you utter when a celebrity says something really stupid that makes you shake your head and question the depth of the IQ pool HP spoilt it by putting a nice big Intel inside sticker right next to the fingerprint reader To make matters worse they couldnt even be bother to put mine on straight As if the kinds of users using this laptop are going to give a shit whether Intel is inside They either bought it themselves in which case they know or they had an IT department do it and then they arent the kind of users who care Either way care factor is somewhere between zero and none Yeah I know you can remove the sticker but you shouldnt have to Given the sticker is removable it drops it to a 975 instead of a 10 Construction is what I would expect for the price range Absolutely impeccable Its rigid well constructed Drop proof Milspec something or other most likely to deal with exec tantrums or those frustrated with that Intel sticker I could almost stop there and say its a near perfect laptop from a construction perspective but sadly I cant HP again did something that needs a facepalm They provided an amazing tiny 65W charger Its compact with a nice wrap around cableand then they spoil the entire experience by attaching a thick 10m power cable to the tiny brick Okay its not 10m thats an exaggeration but the cable between the wall socket and brick would rival the brick for size and weight when folded up And the thickest conceivable cable Its like this cable ate another 5 cables while no one was watching A stand alone adapter would have been nice like Apple provide I e Without the cable I also think they could have provided a shorter cable The Dell comes with a half a meter cable which seems to be more practical and smaller I order a small 05m 20 cable and an adapter which I will use to replace this An unnecessary annoyance x200B Weight The weight on my version which has the bigger battery is 113kgs25 pounds The lighter version in 22 but not available with the 4k screen Thats astounding My 2018 129 iPad Pro with smart keyboard runs at 1070 grams with a smaller lower resolution screen Its also lighter than the new iPad Pro 129 and Magic keyboard 3 Pounds136 kgs and the new Macbook Air 127kgs If Apple wants a lesson in construction unlike the equally expensive and heavier Macbook Pro and Air HP put a bigger battery 4K display fingerprint reader and LTE in the Dragonfly and both the battery and M2 are user replaceable Some would try argue that Apple focus on aesthetics first but even that HP got right What they managed to produce a good looking light weight laptop without screwing the consumer by making it nonuser replaceable Johnny Ives would be shaking his head demanding to know what saucery was used on this laptop With the shift to the Dragonfly Im more than halving my carry weight from 24kgs to 113kgs although the cable from the charger might weigh as much as a Macbook Pro The penstylus experience This is an area I was a little worried about The Apple Pencil experience is really amazing The latency is almost nonexistent and the ink feels like its coming out of the front of your pencil The HP Dragonfly matches this experience and whilst I wouldnt class it as better I also wouldnt class it as worse Its just different Latency isnt quite as good but the Dragonfly has a softer feel like the difference between writing with a pen and a marker Overall I think both are acceptable and choosing one would be hard There are things I like and dont like with either The pen isnt dockable which is an annoyance but Im not sure where you would fit a pen this size on the Dragonfly It would be nice if they offered some form of attachment to keep it on the side Even a magnetic attachment point would be a step up to not having one I like Apples design of having a chargeable magnetic holder and so maybe thats something for them to think about in the next edition Having a cable charger for the pencil isnt ideal Screen Coming from the Macbook Pro 13 the Dragonfly is amazing I dont think the Macbook Pro is necessarily bad but the difference in resolution between the two is noticeable Its one of the best screens Ive seen on a laptop Would love it if HP included the privacy screen on the 4K version It was frustrating having to pick between the privacy and 4K edition but very little of what I do is confidential enough to worry about it Colour accuracy is good but not close to my desktop which has more expensive colour calibrated panel I wont be using it for colour accurate work Keyboard Mousepad Apple used to have amazing keyboards Then they went to this stupid butterfly design that makes it sound like youre a tap dancer while you are typing Ive tried some of the new Lenovo keyboards and I would put them as class leading Miles ahead ahead of Apple So how does the Dragonfly fare Surprisingly well Id say its pretty close to the Lenovo Overall about an 8510 and fairly close to what I would class as a desktop quality experience Ive heard people say the keyboard on the Dragonfly feels cramped but I actually find it pretty good Maybe Im used to the small iPad keyboard but this is decent The mousepad is good Multitouch features are pretty much expected on todays devices and it doesnt disappoint Ergonomics and handling Its a pretty well designed device from a size and features perspective but it suffers a little in the ergonomics area maybe as a result of the small size The location of the USBC is somewhat confusing On the same side as the mouse Seems like an oversight along with the HDMI port I would have put the HDMI and USBC ports on the other side Opening the lid isnt one of its design features There is a little ledge but its not what I would qualify as simple or as simple as it should be for a repetitive task Conclusion Im now bored with this review and running out of crap to write Having covered pretty much everything I can think of if I missed anything let me know What are my final thoughts Im damn impressed This is without a doubt one of the best laptops I have purchased Im still getting used to Windows but from a hardware perspective HP gets a WOW from me and in a good way"

sleek though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue the screen is stellar battery is excellent and it handles most tasks with ease For most users who use nothing but web apps Google Docs Office email YouTube this is more than enough People spending 2000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative BUT looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 this would be the nobrainer recommendation of the year for any laptop especially a Chromebook at 500 as 750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for 850 If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months and this goes down to 450550 for a new one run dont walk to get one if you need a new laptop At that price this is the nobrainer Chromebook of the decade Overall Grade B Me and my bear paws are off to test the next device",
        "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v Price Performance The Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 714 performance increase Screen wobbling Some reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room However when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times for example the delete key Mousepad The glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions loudness brightness etc by a asus tool Quality variations The first model had a unproblematic mouspad The 2nd showed the follwing issue When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again the pad bounces up a tiny bit This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating Keyboard The keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example It has not much damping The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment I noticed not much flex only when forcefully pressing on the keys for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb Minor problems The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge Screen The screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 11800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks screen report before calibration screen report after calibration In both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen Speakers The sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass An wow the volume can be turned up to a very high level Noise The only point that was initially a minus was the fan which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do and the sharp spin up is very audible I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the Asus Fan Control V5 allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode Using the Asus Fan Control dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable Fan Control open source software Fingerprints Fingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver Overall As described the lower priced model can be a good priceperformance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption However when looking for a machine for media editingcreation I would reccommend the 32gb version At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards",
        "Yes I have a question Does the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support WakeOnLan in the BIOS I ask because the notebook does not have an RJ45 Ethernet port but Asus provides an accessory 90XB05WNMCA010 which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support WakeOnLan WOL I imagine that by connecting it at least to the USBA port on the left side which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off it should be able to turn on the computer Although such a feature may seem futile for a notebook since I will keep it as a second home PC when not travelling it can be very convenient to manage it at home from the main PC with TeamViewer or similar software I have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV and it is very convenient Thank you"
