        "Asus Zephyrus G16 2024 vs Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Ive narrowed my search down to 2 laptops and cant decide which to go with Which would you recommend Use I would mainly use the laptop for data science coursework and occasional gaming MS Flight Simulator FIFA GTA I want the laptop to last at least 56 years Price Price is not a factor since Im not paying for it Specs Asus Zephyrus G16 2024Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 6 CPUUltra 9 185Hi913900H GPURTX 4090RTX 4090 TGP115W105W RAM32 GB32 GB SSD2 TB1 TB Display2560x1600 240Hz OLED2560x1600 165 Hz IPS Battery90 Whr90 Whr Power240 W230 W Dimensions cm354 x 246 x 1743595 x 2538 x 175 Both have vapor chamber cooling I like that the ThinkPad doesnt look like a gaming laptop and has lots of reviews whereas the Asus is brand new ThinkPads are also known for their reliability I like that the Asus is slightly smaller has a higher TGP an OLED display slightly better CPU and a higher refresh rate",
        "Despite similar specs the two target very different audiences If your priority is gaming the G16 should get you better graphics performance and will have the better screen although both will have excellent screens better speakers and also include a lot of tuning software allowing you to adjust power limits fan curves keyboard lighting etc You will also benefit from a large online gaming community with loads of tips on how to optimize your computergaming settings If you use the laptop professionally and care about a cleanmuted look bestinclass keyboard Thinkpad support then go with the Thinkpad I for one love the Thinkpad Trackpoint red nub so will always go with the P1 if the specs are the same But it is getting tougher and tougher to choose as Asus has really done a good job making the ROG Zephyrus line pretty clean and sleek"
