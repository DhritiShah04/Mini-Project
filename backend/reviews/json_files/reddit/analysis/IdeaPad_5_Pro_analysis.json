        "For the price you will have to look at your countries offers and if you get some kind of discounts like student discount that Lenovo offers Is it worth it Depends on the price and what you need If you can find a ryzen ai 7 or core ultra 7 256v laptop with good display and the ports you need for about the same price or 150 more that will be the better option Im really happy with it tho I use it 10 hours a day for studying and gaming and battery life display and performance are just great I play Overwatch 2 and CS2 only It stays silent even when gaming and you can play like 3hours without charging"

        "How about Ideapad 5 Pro for 850 vs M1 Mac Air with 16256 for 1137 and a 150 gift card Im going to use it for my research tasks for example using three browsers and keeping at least 15 tabs in each of them open simultaneously and running one word processor thats it I can deal with external storage without any issues What would be the actual battery backup of the 6600HS version My primary requirement is longevity that it should at least survive my multiple browser tabs for 5 to 6 years I have been using one IdeaPad 330S 14 by Lenovo with 8 GB of RAM and 512 SSD with one TB hard drive and extremely poor battery life that is for 35 hours and Ive been using it for a 3 year and 8 months Do you think if I do not take Apple Care Plus then I should not be touching Mac and I would be better off with one Windows device I dont use any Apple products Fixing Apple with out of pocket is surely scary But I just cant find a Windows alternative with similar battery life While Apple is asking significantly more money for less RAM and storage but yes I understand that there are things beyond RAM SSD for which they are doing it I have been used to cheap Windows machines so much that I am pretty reluctant to pay 850 for a Windows machine I am building this argument in my head that if I am going to pay above 850 then it shouldnt be a Windows machine But then comes the back and forth discussion on what are you getting for your money actually It is frustrating I still cant decide",
        "Theres honestly way too much to list that I wouldnt be able to remember most of them The main brands I narrowed my search down to were Apple ASUS Lenovo and Microsoft Came real close to ordering the ROG Zephyrus G14 but there were enough negative reviews complaining about the rubber feet peeling offbecoming discolored displays randomly dyingglitching out and the touchpad being laggy And Ive heard some not so great things about ASUS customer service historically dont know if theyve improved since Gave the 14 MacBook Pro a shot too The hardware itself is great I just dont like OS X And this is coming from someone who has spent most of his life around Macs up until shortly after graduating college 20 yrs ago Dont know what it is about Apple now but I feel like theyve took a turn for the worst since Steve Jobs died Ive grown sick of their anticonsumer practices of peddling AppleCare just to get them to fix THEIR own known design flaws Ive fallen victim to it myself numerous times and Im just done dealing with that By contrast youve got a company like Lenovo which ENCOURAGES owners to disassemble and replace components themselves They even post easy to follow tutorial videos on their own support database So thats part of the reason why they earned huge bonus points for me The one crappy thing with Lenovo though is that theyre Chinese owned and with the trade war taking place now its going to be interesting to see what future availability pricing and support is going to be like I also ordered and tried out the Surface Laptop for Business Overall build quality is on par with MacBooks but it also the most expensive of the bunch setting me back over 2300 for the 138 268V model with 512GB SSD The one I got became uncomfortably toasty just from the initial setup process and some light browsing Something also felt off about the keyboard noticeably mushier than the ThinkPad X9",
