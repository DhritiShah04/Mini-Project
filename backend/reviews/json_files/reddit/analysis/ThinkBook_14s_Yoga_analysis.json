        "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review Too many flaws Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through its paces I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo Shipping was fast packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess Some context Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows Surface laptop 4 Pretty good but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping and random restarts Sold it after a bit Lenovo Slim 7 pro X Great machine but had two major issues System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios disabling it fixed the lockups Also there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times Lenovo Slim pro 7 Excellent machine literally zero issues Truly a unicorn The build quality was terrible and thus I returned it Decent aluminum enclosure but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges Honestly wish I kept it after this Surface Laptop 7 Excellent laptop ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought Sold it and stuck with X86 A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo Lets get into the Aura Build quality Its alright Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7 Durability concerns are no more Port cutouts are somewhat sharp and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts Some ports are slightly misaligned but everything fits Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac but itll do Hinge feels fine trackpad is installed firm with no rattle I hate the YOGA text on the palmrest Its clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout and not very well mind you with the text slightly misaligned It just looks a bit cheap Overall its well built enough for most people to be happy but its nowhere near some of its competitors Display Mostly very good Very bright very colorful great pixel density 120hz good touch implementation and completely free of defects Its not all great though I generally prefer IPS panels but the contrast on this one doesnt cut it All IPS panels have IPS glow but this one has the worst case of glow Ive ever seen Its even noticeable looking at it straight on making the panel look almost TN at times This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content Its not terrible but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS Note there is likely a display lottery here so youre mileage may vary Trackpad keyboard The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic but its a very good traditional unit Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click Feels responsive when its working more on that later gestures work great at least as good as they can in W11 Keyboard is excellent ThinkPad level Wonderful tactility and travel The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great Backlighting is uniform and consistent if not a little too bright on its dimmest setting Speakers Completely blown away by these Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience but these are excellent Definitely a bit bass heavy but no distortion at normal volume levels They sound full and mostly clear could do with a bit more midrange Head and shoulders above any windows machine Ive ever used period Performance noise A little disappointed in the noise output No complaints with performance Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste Dont get me wrong huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked but its not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz the fans are frequently noticeable especially with heavy multitasking Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up The system is not hot or even warm really its just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems Miscellaneous software WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far No dropping of connections connects upon waking etc Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop Windows came with some bloat including McAfee but all was easy to get rid of Windows hello has been mostly reliable minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode I had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444 No specific setting did the trick it seems to be a bit broken at the moment Adding on to the state of Intel software every time I reboot this thing Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display prompting me to go in and reset all color settings Tried different drivers among other things to no avail Very strange issue Phantom touches Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as Im working Extremely annoying The dealbreakers I dont know about you but I prefer my touchpad to work properly I mean that cant be too much to ask right Well either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature or there is some sort of driver hardware issue After a period of inactivity like say 13 minutes the trackpad will frequently enter a sleep state and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up which is extremely annoying Ive tried a few fixes for this including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches but the issue persists Never experienced anything like this Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware Even if it is a hardware issue Id honestly rather not give Lenovos QC lottery another shot Besides we already have issues with the touchscreen windows hello and flaky Intel software while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless Lenovo can make a good computer but this isnt one of them at least mine isnt Conclusion I really wanted this to be good It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker not to mention the other quirks Regardless Im not keen on trying a replacement Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it Edit I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues Only bare essential drivers installed The system feels much faster now and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor but the trackpad issue persists Looks like its going back Edit 2 For those PWM or dithering sensitive this section is for you It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook pressure in sinuses headache etc Its likely temporal dithering as the IPS panel is PWM free It affects external monitors too which points to the iGPU being the issue 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help I tried using Ditherig software to disable dithering and while it does have an effect on dithering color banding the strain remains",
        "Update 030825 The display started doing weird things half of it goes dark and then comes back Getting worse by the day Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear I dont do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop quite the opposite I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded So not as sturdy as I initially thought Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international so Ill have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty or make do with half the screen Ill leave my experience with it after a few days of use coming from an xps 9500 btw I agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro Build quality is good its super thin but sturdy my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light Its pretty anoying and looks dated From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes and at night when you are watching something in bed its really annoying Also I thought I wouldnt mind that it cant be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience Display is really reflective with a dark background it becomes a problem I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well also there is 0 light bleed But oled is just miles better again the g16 The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly graysIf it werent for the reflexions I would say its a 8 out of 10 but it gets a 7 keyboard Its good not thinkpad level Other than the annoying lighting I am more than satisfied Trackpad is ok It works but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click which is really annoying It is also pretty loud and a bit small for the times we live in Serviceable but you miss the mouse Speakes Meh I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome The g16s are even better they blow you away with their quality These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers even my old xps sounds better They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min Sound signature is terrible too much base lacking mids and ok highs Also poor stereo separation The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds Performance nice so far pretty snappy I didnt ask much of it yet though Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9 which packs a weaker igpu Battery I think is an old day no prob laptop its great Fan noise Its being good so far for simple tasks even coding with copilot I cant hear the fans When you push it a bit they quickly come in but they are not loud and they quickly stop again For my use case is mostly silent update While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised Wifi weak reception In the same spot the g16 gets 400mb this only gets 250mb Its pretty dissapointing I think its a good laptop just over 400 overpriced in Europe is 1700 after taxes",
        "Best review on this model out there Those youtube reviewers should take notes I returned mine as well for similar reasons Here are my observations 1 Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video This applies even in battery saver mode Fans are not quiet either 2 This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch So that single sided PCB and cooling is working Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming 3 There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75 of the time you are using laptop I dont know if it is Lenovos AI Core learning usage patterns or some other softwarefirmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times And whenever there is something loading like a tabvideo you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip 4 IPS Screen has 100 perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a glow at all times Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the videoscene you are watching For comparison I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrastblacks 5 Build quality is good not as good as XPS or Thinkpad but very acceptable The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound 6 Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab However if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows You have to refresh the windowtab to reinitiate a stream I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7 7 I have read several people had trackpadtouchpad becoming unresponsive issue after a few mins of idling but I didnt have this issue I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop 8 Full size 2280 M2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover I wouldnt recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly Also you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so Probably thats why Lenovo didnt ship it with a 2280 I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender So yes very good slimlight laptop overall 153 screen size is perfect too though I hope these spinning wheel fan noise trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead"

        "The low RPM noise isnt too bad its just the fact its there at all that irks me Its completely unnecessary to have such an aggressive fan curve with a Lunar lake chip inside but I wouldnt say its a dealbreaker The eye strain comes from the GPU not the glossy display surface Same strain when docked Seems to be recent intel GPUs from what Ive read causing issues for those sensitive to dither or whatever rendering technique it is that causes the pain",
        "Its really subjective Do you have any issues with other modern devices In laptops I find Intel Xe iGPUs to be bad for eye strain Nvidia perfectly fine AMD tolerable but not ideal",
        "Thanks so much for the detailed insight Your real world experience with snap is helpful Im not a gamer so that side effect isnt a big issue for me but Ill definitely doublecheck the specific software I need i use vs code and someone mentioned not all plugins are compatible and look into Prism compatibility I went to Officeworks the other day to try out the laptop and I was impressed with its sleek aluminium build The keyboard felt a bit odd to the touch but thats fine since Ill be using an external keyboard anyway I opened around 30 tabsYouTube Reddit news sites job portalsand there was a slight lag which I expected but it didnt heat up and the fans never kicked in which was nice The only letdown was the touchpad It felt premium but it didnt always register my singletap clicks which got a bit frustrating Still Ill be using an external mouse most of the time so its not a dealbreaker for me"

        "It could match a MacBook Pro though and still be a horrible laptop For example unless its one of the newest MacBook pros you might be used to an incredibly glossy screen that leads to a busted user experience if there are windows or uncontrolled lights nearby My M1 Max MacBook Pro was also incredibly laggy for things like window snapping and some other things where I couldnt get rid of the animation and you just have to wait for part of a second from time to time before you can do things Pretty amazing that it compares to a multithousand dollar laptop but also multithousand dollar laptops these days can be pretty disgusting or at least that has been my experience with the M1 Max and some Windows laptops from Dell Asus and Framework being laggy with windows 11 Maybe its just a software problem though and I shouldnt be comparing wildly inefficient operating systems like Mac OS and Windows 11 to things like debloated Windows 10 or Linux on a 12yearold Thinkpad originally rated for 24 hours of battery life"

        "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad also no blue wheel But I had a couple of problems since then my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two no charging data transfer and video transfer But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling it happened 34 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again even on pressing on the power button So I had to force shutting it down Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode eg overnight or for a couple of hours not of use Casual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15 IPS panel so far is great also the thin and lightweight build But Im not 100 sure if I want to keep it Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming Maybe someone has a recommendation Also is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well"

        "Update 030825 The display started doing weird things half of it goes dark and then comes back Getting worse by the day Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear I dont do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop quite the opposite I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded So not as sturdy as I initially thought Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international so Ill have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty or make do with half the screen Ill leave my experience with it after a few days of use coming from an xps 9500 btw I agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro Build quality is good its super thin but sturdy my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light Its pretty anoying and looks dated From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes and at night when you are watching something in bed its really annoying Also I thought I wouldnt mind that it cant be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience Display is really reflective with a dark background it becomes a problem I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well also there is 0 light bleed But oled is just miles better again the g16 The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly graysIf it werent for the reflexions I would say its a 8 out of 10 but it gets a 7 keyboard Its good not thinkpad level Other than the annoying lighting I am more than satisfied Trackpad is ok It works but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click which is really annoying It is also pretty loud and a bit small for the times we live in Serviceable but you miss the mouse Speakes Meh I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome The g16s are even better they blow you away with their quality These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers even my old xps sounds better They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min Sound signature is terrible too much base lacking mids and ok highs Also poor stereo separation The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds Performance nice so far pretty snappy I didnt ask much of it yet though Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9 which packs a weaker igpu Battery I think is an old day no prob laptop its great Fan noise Its being good so far for simple tasks even coding with copilot I cant hear the fans When you push it a bit they quickly come in but they are not loud and they quickly stop again For my use case is mostly silent update While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised Wifi weak reception In the same spot the g16 gets 400mb this only gets 250mb Its pretty dissapointing I think its a good laptop just over 400 overpriced in Europe is 1700 after taxes",

        "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review Too many flaws Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through its paces I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo Shipping was fast packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess Some context Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows Surface laptop 4 Pretty good but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping and random restarts Sold it after a bit Lenovo Slim 7 pro X Great machine but had two major issues System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios disabling it fixed the lockups Also there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times Lenovo Slim pro 7 Excellent machine literally zero issues Truly a unicorn The build quality was terrible and thus I returned it Decent aluminum enclosure but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges Honestly wish I kept it after this Surface Laptop 7 Excellent laptop ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought Sold it and stuck with X86 A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo Lets get into the Aura Build quality Its alright Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7 Durability concerns are no more Port cutouts are somewhat sharp and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts Some ports are slightly misaligned but everything fits Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac but itll do Hinge feels fine trackpad is installed firm with no rattle I hate the YOGA text on the palmrest Its clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout and not very well mind you with the text slightly misaligned It just looks a bit cheap Overall its well built enough for most people to be happy but its nowhere near some of its competitors Display Mostly very good Very bright very colorful great pixel density 120hz good touch implementation and completely free of defects Its not all great though I generally prefer IPS panels but the contrast on this one doesnt cut it All IPS panels have IPS glow but this one has the worst case of glow Ive ever seen Its even noticeable looking at it straight on making the panel look almost TN at times This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content Its not terrible but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS Note there is likely a display lottery here so youre mileage may vary Trackpad keyboard The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic but its a very good traditional unit Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click Feels responsive when its working more on that later gestures work great at least as good as they can in W11 Keyboard is excellent ThinkPad level Wonderful tactility and travel The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great Backlighting is uniform and consistent if not a little too bright on its dimmest setting Speakers Completely blown away by these Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience but these are excellent Definitely a bit bass heavy but no distortion at normal volume levels They sound full and mostly clear could do with a bit more midrange Head and shoulders above any windows machine Ive ever used period Performance noise A little disappointed in the noise output No complaints with performance Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste Dont get me wrong huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked but its not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz the fans are frequently noticeable especially with heavy multitasking Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up The system is not hot or even warm really its just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems Miscellaneous software WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far No dropping of connections connects upon waking etc Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop Windows came with some bloat including McAfee but all was easy to get rid of Windows hello has been mostly reliable minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode I had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444 No specific setting did the trick it seems to be a bit broken at the moment Adding on to the state of Intel software every time I reboot this thing Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display prompting me to go in and reset all color settings Tried different drivers among other things to no avail Very strange issue Phantom touches Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as Im working Extremely annoying The dealbreakers I dont know about you but I prefer my touchpad to work properly I mean that cant be too much to ask right Well either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature or there is some sort of driver hardware issue After a period of inactivity like say 13 minutes the trackpad will frequently enter a sleep state and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up which is extremely annoying Ive tried a few fixes for this including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches but the issue persists Never experienced anything like this Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware Even if it is a hardware issue Id honestly rather not give Lenovos QC lottery another shot Besides we already have issues with the touchscreen windows hello and flaky Intel software while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless Lenovo can make a good computer but this isnt one of them at least mine isnt Conclusion I really wanted this to be good It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker not to mention the other quirks Regardless Im not keen on trying a replacement Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it Edit I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues Only bare essential drivers installed The system feels much faster now and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor but the trackpad issue persists Looks like its going back Edit 2 For those PWM or dithering sensitive this section is for you It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook pressure in sinuses headache etc Its likely temporal dithering as the IPS panel is PWM free It affects external monitors too which points to the iGPU being the issue 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help I tried using Ditherig software to disable dithering and while it does have an effect on dithering color banding the strain remains",
        "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura No phantom touch for me Trackpad works great And no blue wheel issue I also never turn on any send data analytics update So that might be whats causing the blue wheel I daily drive with a MacBook Pro and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far Surface laptop 7 is great too but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue"
