        "Factory Reset corporate Lenovo ThinkPad E14 laptop with locked BIOS and BitLocker I used to work for contractor for a company that issued me a Lenovo ThinkPad E14 laptop I finished the contract over 2 years ago but they never requested or sent me instructions on how to return the laptop so its been sitting unused since I figure the statue of limitations has expired and would like to reset this laptop so I can use it as a personal device Unfortunately the BIOS is locked so Im unable to boot from USB I am able to login to the computer using my old Microsoft credentials even though the Microsoft account is likely expired But this user account is not a local admin so its pretty restricted Also the disk was encrypted using BitLocker and I do not have the BitLocker recovery key Is there any way to reset this laptop Or is it much too complicated and I should toss it in recycling There is no personal data on the laptop so Im not concerned about identify theft or anything like that Of course the company I contracted with might not appreciate the laptop going to recycling I could remove the hard drive and destroy that But is there any way to salvage this laptop and resetrepurpose it as a personal device"
