        "Lenovo Yoga 9i 2in1 Aura Edition vs HP Omnibook Flip Ultra 14 Hi all I had the opportunity to try the Lenovo Yoga 9i 2in1 Aura Edition alongside the HP Omnibook Flip Ultra 14 both with the same configuration 32GB RAM and the same processor Many people have asked me about the differences so I decided to share my impressions First Sorry for any mistakes English is not my first language The HP is a beautiful device and smaller than the Lenovo It also has a sturdier display and a nice design But it is just personal preferable However the Lenovo has better battery life it lasts me all day if Im not gaming really great In stress tests both performed similarly but Lenovo was slightly better I think Lenovo has nicer colors and the quick side buttons for performance adjustments became an instant favorite for me Lenovo has an excellent keyboard which I prefer over HPs though some might find the extra side keys bothersome I personally find them great Typing on the Lenovo keyboard feels comfortable Both have the same keyboard backlighting but Lenovos felt better to me The stylus is good on both but the Lenovo stylus feels better in my hand Writing and drawing on the screen feel the same though palm rejection on the Lenovo seems slightly better Gaming Neither laptop is designed for gaming but they can handle lighter games like The Sims without major issues I believe the HP Omnibook had slightly better FPS but the difference was minimal Noise Levels Both laptops can be quiet The Lenovo makes absolutely no noise during regular use Even when playing simple games on balanced or lower performance modes it remains silent In contrast the HP Omnibook always had a faint hissing sound which slightly bothered me The cooling system would frequently activate However at high performance levels the HP Omnibook was quieter and more bearable than the Lenovo Yoga Under heavy load Lenovos fans engage more aggressively and are quite audible Gaming on high performance mode sounds like a mild vacuum cleanersimilar to a gaming laptop So for demanding tasks and intense applications HP wins in terms of noise control On the other hand Lenovo is completely silent during standard usage whereas HP is slightly audible HP does ramp up its fans under high performance too but its noise level is lower or at least more tolerable compared to Lenovo Temperature At idle my Lenovo was around 2632C while the HP was roughly 2531C During standard tasks like watching videos or using Copilot both reached similar temperatures of 3545C depending on workload Gaming temperatures reached around 50C Overall HP was about one degree cooler But under high performance mode I feel Lenovo cooled slightly faster and better though the fan noise was noticeable more on lenovo than HP but the difference was minimal Software Both come with several preinstalled apps However Lenovo Yoga includes two free premium programs one for drawing and another for notes while HP does not Both have decent applications for managing updates and performance settings Summary Both laptops feel highquality and have a beautiful design They are very similar in performance with identical configurations Speed is comparable and they both handled stress tests well Lenovo performed slightly better maybe likely due to stronger cooling Overall both are solid choices Lenovo stands out with a better keyboard fast side keys for performance adjustments which might not appeal to everyone two free creative apps and complete silence during standard use HP on the other hand offers Gorilla Glass a sleek design a more compact build and quieter operation at high performance levels though its fans are slightly audible even during regular tasks I decided to keep the Lenovo Yoga For me it feels better Lenovo Yoga has undergone military durability tests but HP felt slightly more solid to me though this is just my impression Both are excellent laptops but Lenovo Yoga seemed to offer more for the price Please note that this is a personal review not a professional one Everyone has different preferences and my assessment is based on using both laptops simultaneously However it is difficult to judge them fully as I only had about a day to test them both on the same time",
        "I also was eyeing these computers I had a look at two different best buys on two separate days My first instinct was the HP omnibook had a nice build and hardware for the price The Lenovo caught my eye but was more than I wanted to spend so I didnt really pursue it much Upon returning to the store after watching some reviews online I went back to the Omni book pulled up YouTube on the highest resolution and was very underwhelmed by the video quality and screen refresh rate I also was not a fan of the low travel keyboard on the omnibook I returned to the Lenovo and saw it discounted to 1349 I also considered the ZenBook s 14 but they did not have this on display and it was so close in price I went with the Lenovo After unboxing and set up Im very happy to say I made the right decision OLED 120hz 3k screen with 32g RAM and Intel ultra 7 hit all my boxes and hope to keep this computer for many years",
        "Hey yeah I went with the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9 I intended to use it for some casual video editing and music productions because the specs seemed good enough for it turns out life is so busy and I am just unmotivated to make time for it Tis now lightly put to work for simple web browsing and mostly YouTube viewing However I dont ever see myself buying another laptop or pc in the future I play console if I ever game And for what it is it really is a decent laptop in terms of on paper specs and I can see it being put to work for what it is built for and being good at it But Im no laptop expert and Im sure there are better laptops out there for just as much or whatever Having owned it for just a little over 2 months I have nothing to complain about Fan is quiet I get at least half a day of battery with the light use I do now its almost always hooked up with the charger The screen is a bit glassy and could be a bit brighter during the day It is good for how I use it now and if I ever do use it with my original intentions I am pretty sure it wouldnt have a problem doing it That is my take on this machine"

        "Yeah from what Ive seen it will get worse battery performance but the p16 isnt exactly like a just leave your charger at home type laptop either Both can be stretched to get decent light web browsing and video type performance but if youre wanting to do anything intensive like photo or video editing youre not going to last a work day Im curious if you find an upgraded 99wh battery for the Lenovo since the battery is replaceable",
        "You can get the one with higher resolution that can improve watching media if you wanna watch some movie in high quality or something but if you wanna play games these laptops depend on igpus so they are weak so dont expect much from them in that case also what are the specs of your desktop if you dont mind sharing"

        "Ironically Im in this dilemma right now After several days of researching every type of laptops looking over features specs etc Ive narrowed by choice between both laptops same configurations Im torn on which computer to buy Here are my current Pros Cons of each that have left me undecided from a consumer perspective Cant determine which feature are more important over the other for a Business Analyst role in Retail sales StylistPen Lenova Yes Omnibook No Retail Best buy As of 41725 Lenova 134999 Omnibook 159999 Resolution Lenova 3840 x 2400 4K Omnibook 2880 x 1800 3K SSD Lenova SSD at 1TB Omnibook at 2TB Processors Lenova Intel Core Ultra 7 Series 1 Omnibook Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 AI Copilot Lenova No Omnibook Yes Scores tied 3 3 Both are Intel Arc Both are 32GB Ram Both are Touchscreen Review comments Lenova 94 customer reviews More Review Feedback Portable laptop with a stunning touchscreen OLED display They appreciate its fast performance 1TB SSD storage and powerful Intel Core Ultra 7 processor However some users have concerns about its battery life and occasional blue screen issues Omnibook 94 customer reviews bloatware Preloaded w software does not come with Laptop sleeve USB C to USB A or HDMI adapter given its cost Only allows one persons facial recognition to login long battery life which allows for extended usage without the need for frequent charging performance is highly regarded with users praising its responsiveness and ability to handle multitasking efficiently The sleek design and lightweight construction of the laptop are also wellreceived making it a portable and stylish choice for users Leaning toward purchasing the Omnibook unless someone yells NOOOOO youre making a huge mistake Quick Update Just realized im comparing a different Lenova product to the Omnibook Im comparing is different than OP im comparing the Lenovo Yoga 9i 2in1 14 4K OLED Touchscreen Laptop with Pen to the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 2in1 Copilot PC",
        "Yeah after exhaustive research Ive found theres no perfect device MacBooks seem nice but they have their flaws too and you pay way too much for them You pick your flaws Personally Im leaning towards a laptop and tablet combo If you need just something ultra portable with loads of battery for light tasks why not just snag a tablet Plus you could rig it as a second display for your laptop Im wanting to do this anyways because I think Id like having a writing tablet for note taking and white boarding programming projects while in meetings Then if I want to catch up on personal emails during lunch or review notes of new stuff Im learning I can leave the laptop at my desk If I know Im going to a coffee shop to go do some more serious work I can always take a GaN charger which should be plenty Photoshop and davinci Im considering something like a Lenovo tab plus or something Doesnt need to be super beefy just handle obsidian and content consumption really"

        "Since youre now comparing this to coming from an Apple product let me explain For laptop PCs expect 1y4y because of hardware degradation and WinOS issues later on Maybe 5y if you really take care of it and reformat the OS when it needs it after years 15y3y Not everyone keeps a MacBook for over 4y5y either 16gb on Windows 11 OS is bare minimum for enthusiasts which means that if youre into design and multitasking why bother with anything less than 32gb 8gb RAM on Win10 OS was already barely cutting it for just regular usage 32gb is for breathing room of other applications that need to remain running in the background as of Q42023 If youre spending that much just get the 32gb RAM and be done with it RE occasionally solidworks This statement alone already closes the gap of 16gb vs 32gb Honestly youre sacrificing a lot to get a 21 computer with a hot burning Pprocessor on a thin frame and the lack of upgrade to 64gb RAM Get the computer right where its not sacrificing power thermals and RAM upgrade capability and just get a regular laptop thats not a 21 flatbread laptop IE ThinkPad X1 Extreme gen5 is a thin laptop with advanced cooling capability on hot CPUGPU and it just blatantly sucks its not setup for long term thermals barrier push If you want to take notes that badly onto a tablet then get a discounted iPad or Galaxy tablet with a pen to see if youre even going to use it or not People have gotten through engineering courses on notebook paper and heavy laptops youre not the first to need a tablet computer but I wont rule it out of the equation if thats your preference for learning in the class and being on the go Yoga Pro 9i will work with 16gb but the RAM is not upgradeable and youll likely be regretting it later by not jumping to the 32gb for an few extra bucks",
        "I have the Slim Pro 9i with the Intel i9 The battery is shit on the laptop You get 34 hours of battery with screen refresh at 60hz back light all the way down and on battery saver mode 152 hours max if you just run it like you have it plugged in Is this the miniLED model The monitor sucks It looked awesome when I first got it Then the nightmare came My panel developed pink tinted patches and stripes all over 9 months in Saw at least 5 others who reported their monitors failing in the same exact way I think the miniLED technology is too new and isnt mature Youll end up being the beta tester Lenovos repair process in the US is a nightmare and I went through it in October 3 weeks no working laptop 4 repairs 3 failed repairs 2 onsite and 2 depot repairs to swap the monitor On the 3rd repair I was literally sent back a laptop without any SSD inside The factory SSD was unencrypted and they should have known about it since I notified them multiple times on the paperwork they had me fill out Couldnt get a straight answer out of them past that point and they even tried to claim the laptop never had an SSD in it when they first got it Their repair depot CSAT Solutions tried to charge for both repairs by claiming customer induced damage Lenovo never owned up to it I only got some closure on the whole ordeal by doing software forensics on the wiped drive they sent back with the laptop on the 4th repair When I looked up CSAT Solutions come to find exemployees call that place a sweatshop seen plenty of other repair nightmares from people and that they service Dell Apple and Lenovo"
