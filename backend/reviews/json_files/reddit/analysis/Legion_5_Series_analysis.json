        "Is this repair guy lying to me Lenovo Legion 5 not able to charge says he needs to replace the entire board Sorry for the long post I just feel like I need to write this all down for my sanity Im a computer science major in university so I use my laptop Lenovo Legion 5 I7 core NVdia Geforce GTX 4 yrs old a ton as I dont have a desktop A few days ago I worked on my laptop earlier in the morning then later in the day plugged it in and it wasnt able to turn on at all I let it sit for a few hours and then I was able to turn it on but it stopped being able to charge Figured it was a problem with the charging port since I tried with another charger and it wouldnt work was planning on fixing it myself until I saw that you needed to solder off the charging port to replace it and decided it was too riskyhigh effort to do myself Took it to a local mom and pop place with high reviews 49 stars on Google with 121 reviews They seemed relatively trustworthy said they had an open shop policy so let us look over their shoulder when they first opened the laptop up didnt have us sign anything suspicious was clearly a family running the store together and had a cute dog which maymay not have swayed my opinion a lot They opened it up but didnt seem too clear on what was wrong with it and says that theyll need to take it all apart to figure out the issue mentioned that a lot of the screws came loose from me using it so much that there was a lot of lintdust in the fans and that they were surprised something didnt go wrong with it earlier and held the open laptop to show us This kind of matched up since the laptop has gone through a lot one time the keyboard stopped working it has a crack in the plastic part occasionally gets the blue screen of death after I took a coding class that messes with the memory a lot so I figured it was just worse off than I thought Gave a final estimate of the repair being 50289 and 23 days to complete and I paid 50 down for the inspection of the issue that counts towards the total cost of the repair A full day passes and so I call the place asking for an update The dad of the shop says that he was working all morning on my laptop Says he needs to replace the entire board and has been looking online for one Says that he found that a screw came loose and grounded somewhere on the board and basically blew some stuff up Specifically listed that a capacitor the mother board and the input charger was shot though seemed to vaguely imply there were other parts affected Says he has taken pictures of all of it for me Then he says hell call back with the price the board would be so that I could decide if it was worth paying much more for it Calls back in a couple of minutes and says that the part is only available in China and will be 59999 to replace I ask if the repair will end up costing more than 59999 due to labor costs and he very adamantly says that he does flat pricing and that it will only be 59999 I say that I want to take it somewhere else to get a second opinion At first he says that oh but this is board problem and Im the only person in town who is able to do that and trails off before adding that he has already replaced the mousepad apparently was burned all the way through and one of the capacitor and trails off again that the laptop is all opened up and he would need to put everything back together for someone else to look at I eventually say that I am going to come 2 days later since I am busy tomorrow and the day after to look at it in person see his pictures and then decide if I want to get a second opinion Honestly I was just lying and I think no matter what I am taking it to get a second opinion But Im worried still mostly because I feel like the scenarios are Theyre wellmeaning but confused laptop can actually be fixed at much lower price somewhere else best case Theyre lying about the state of the laptop to get more money it can be repaired at a much lower price somewhere else and they let me do that basically same as best case but makes me feel worse Theyre right and the laptop does need its board entirely replaced for high price Theyre lying about the state of the laptop and now since Ive pressed to see it in person and view the pictures theyre going to deliberately damage it to corroborate their story worst case And Im very worried that itll be the latter story This is especially because I didnt take pictures of the interior of the laptop beforehand In general though I feel like its very suspicious The kind of damage that messes up the whole board I feel like should have been much more noticeable and Im honestly not even sure how a screw could have come loose and damaged the board like that I also just find it weird because the laptop was perfectly functional just not able to charge but the damage he is describing seems like it would also affect the laptops function aside from the charging Out of the very few bad reviews one person had a very similar story about having to get a part from China and it being very expensive which is boggling my mind now attached image below Im not even sure if I can get my 50 back which really bothers me But then again if they do genuinely need the part I feel like it would be that price in which case is this even a bad deal Im just feeling duped right now and need a sanity check some advice on how to proceed",
        "If you are planning on getting a replacement in three years sure this will work but by year 2 you will see performance issues via the 16GB of RAM People also continually report that HP has terrible build quality",
        "Ive never needed more than 8gb hell even DDR3 does more than enough for me Most of the stuff I use is either background music for studying Obsidian Minecraft on low settings or BTD6 Rarely do I ever video edit or anything like that that requires more"

        "Is this repair guy lying to me Lenovo Legion 5 not able to charge says he needs to replace the entire board Sorry for the long post I just feel like I need to write this all down for my sanity Im a computer science major in university so I use my laptop Lenovo Legion 5 I7 core NVdia Geforce GTX 4 yrs old a ton as I dont have a desktop A few days ago I worked on my laptop earlier in the morning then later in the day plugged it in and it wasnt able to turn on at all I let it sit for a few hours and then I was able to turn it on but it stopped being able to charge Figured it was a problem with the charging port since I tried with another charger and it wouldnt work was planning on fixing it myself until I saw that you needed to solder off the charging port to replace it and decided it was too riskyhigh effort to do myself Took it to a local mom and pop place with high reviews 49 stars on Google with 121 reviews They seemed relatively trustworthy said they had an open shop policy so let us look over their shoulder when they first opened the laptop up didnt have us sign anything suspicious was clearly a family running the store together and had a cute dog which maymay not have swayed my opinion a lot They opened it up but didnt seem too clear on what was wrong with it and says that theyll need to take it all apart to figure out the issue mentioned that a lot of the screws came loose from me using it so much that there was a lot of lintdust in the fans and that they were surprised something didnt go wrong with it earlier and held the open laptop to show us This kind of matched up since the laptop has gone through a lot one time the keyboard stopped working it has a crack in the plastic part occasionally gets the blue screen of death after I took a coding class that messes with the memory a lot so I figured it was just worse off than I thought Gave a final estimate of the repair being 50289 and 23 days to complete and I paid 50 down for the inspection of the issue that counts towards the total cost of the repair A full day passes and so I call the place asking for an update The dad of the shop says that he was working all morning on my laptop Says he needs to replace the entire board and has been looking online for one Says that he found that a screw came loose and grounded somewhere on the board and basically blew some stuff up Specifically listed that a capacitor the mother board and the input charger was shot though seemed to vaguely imply there were other parts affected Says he has taken pictures of all of it for me Then he says hell call back with the price the board would be so that I could decide if it was worth paying much more for it Calls back in a couple of minutes and says that the part is only available in China and will be 59999 to replace I ask if the repair will end up costing more than 59999 due to labor costs and he very adamantly says that he does flat pricing and that it will only be 59999 I say that I want to take it somewhere else to get a second opinion At first he says that oh but this is board problem and Im the only person in town who is able to do that and trails off before adding that he has already replaced the mousepad apparently was burned all the way through and one of the capacitor and trails off again that the laptop is all opened up and he would need to put everything back together for someone else to look at I eventually say that I am going to come 2 days later since I am busy tomorrow and the day after to look at it in person see his pictures and then decide if I want to get a second opinion Honestly I was just lying and I think no matter what I am taking it to get a second opinion But Im worried still mostly because I feel like the scenarios are Theyre wellmeaning but confused laptop can actually be fixed at much lower price somewhere else best case Theyre lying about the state of the laptop to get more money it can be repaired at a much lower price somewhere else and they let me do that basically same as best case but makes me feel worse Theyre right and the laptop does need its board entirely replaced for high price Theyre lying about the state of the laptop and now since Ive pressed to see it in person and view the pictures theyre going to deliberately damage it to corroborate their story worst case And Im very worried that itll be the latter story This is especially because I didnt take pictures of the interior of the laptop beforehand In general though I feel like its very suspicious The kind of damage that messes up the whole board I feel like should have been much more noticeable and Im honestly not even sure how a screw could have come loose and damaged the board like that I also just find it weird because the laptop was perfectly functional just not able to charge but the damage he is describing seems like it would also affect the laptops function aside from the charging Out of the very few bad reviews one person had a very similar story about having to get a part from China and it being very expensive which is boggling my mind now attached image below Im not even sure if I can get my 50 back which really bothers me But then again if they do genuinely need the part I feel like it would be that price in which case is this even a bad deal Im just feeling duped right now and need a sanity check some advice on how to proceed"
