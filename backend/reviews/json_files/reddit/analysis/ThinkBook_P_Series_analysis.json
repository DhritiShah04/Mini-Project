        "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 which has been hyped up as the supreme being of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip Im just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively especially when something costs close to 800 This is an honest review no marketing fluff of just reading the specs I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel While I was overall impressed I think this machine is overhyped mainly because of the chip Its not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas Im coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9 with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which EATS UP anything I throw at it AI photovideo editing multi tasking video calls Thats my dream give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises So heres my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week alongside my trusty daily driver the HP Chromebook x360 14c i38GB RAM which is still a beast since 2021 Build Design The Lenovo is thin and light but solid It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality especially when typing Its so light it almost feels like a dummy unit but clearly isnt It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware Only downside The bottom is plastic so it lacks that full premium unibody feel But unless youre carrying it around a lot its a nonissue People mentioned keyboard flex but I didnt experience any in daily use And Im a weightlifter and former lineman with 105inch bear paws I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard The hinge is firm you cant open it with one hand but once open it holds its position perfectly Compared to the HP 14c the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter My HP is a full aluminum tank its been a champ for years The Lenovo feels like itll hold up but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time Build Grade A Battery Life Lets be real I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours But thats OK because I still got a solid 9105 hours under heavy realworld use 2030 tabs open Zoom app Teams web YouTube music streaming Constant typing Screen at 70 Compared to my aging HP which lasts about 45 hours now this is a major win For comparison the HP Dragonfly Pro 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours That thing didnt last the weekend before it went back Battery Grade A Keyboard Trackpad Fingerprint Reader Typing on this was a breeze even with my bear paws No real keyboard flex during regular use The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c but once I got into a groove I had no complaints Trackpad is large smooth and accurate feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness No lag no misclicks The fingerprint reader One of the best Ive used on a Chromebook or any computer I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger but nope still unlocked instantly Grade A Sound Speakers The Dolbybranded speakers had me hopeful but theyre great for a Chromebook but average overall My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water so its nothing special there They do have more depth than 99 of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall its still Chromebook speakers so they are decent in a small room The HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers but again good for a chrombook but in realworld usage they are just ok Grade C overall B for a Chromebook Chip Performance Kompanio Ultra 910 Heres where the hype train slows down In benchmarks Jetstream Speedometer this chip was twice as fast as my HPs i3 In realworld use Not really Its only slightly faster like a 051 second lead in page loads even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets Yes it wins technically but it was often a photo finish I ran into consistent problems using Teams in the browser Video calls would freeze the screen would stutter and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera Reddit confirms Im not alone on this Zoom via app worked fine but Teams was rough No such issues on my HP But the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience as some of the apps would be better on a fullscreen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone I tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called InShot and it temporarily presented a dream come true to have InShot on a laptop not a tablet with an added on keyboard where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15second 4k files and thats when it went to crap fast As soon as I added in a transition it became super laggy and jittery and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam it looks like it should work and has the same shape and characteristics but no it wont do at all AI features like background blur or object removal Not there yet Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets My last point about the chip is why not use past 12 year old true flagship chips that can do it all like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Galaxy Tab S9 series If they are going to charge such a premium price and say its because of the chip bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI multitasking video editing and more all at the same time and then Chrome OS would be a monster Grade B Screen Camera Now this screen WOW Its a 2K OLED panel thats absolutely beautiful I watched an 8K Planet Earth video on Youtube and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it The best screen Ive ever seen on a Chromebook Also they list the Lenovo at 400 nits but it feels much brighter than 400 I kept the screen constantly at 6070 and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases BUT a few things Some imagesweb pages looked oversaturated No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS The camera is also surprisingly good Not Galaxy Ultra good but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting Grade A Final Thoughts This is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks especially with ARM chips The design is sleek though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue the screen is stellar battery is excellent and it handles most tasks with ease For most users who use nothing but web apps Google Docs Office email YouTube this is more than enough People spending 2000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative BUT looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 this would be the nobrainer recommendation of the year for any laptop especially a Chromebook at 500 as 750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for 850 If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months and this goes down to 450550 for a new one run dont walk to get one if you need a new laptop At that price this is the nobrainer Chromebook of the decade Overall Grade B Me and my bear paws are off to test the next device",
        "Great review thanks a lot Very well written and exactly what I was looking for Edit I have one more question How well or poorly does the touch display respond And were you able to test Android games on it Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices Two questions Those were two questions Sorry",
        "Looking to buy new laptop under 1200 USD Hey Everyone TLDR Looking to Buy a reliable professionalgrade laptop around 300000 PKR with strong CPU performance expandable RAM and SSD options a capable GPU for rendering decoding and solid build quality Preferably new with local warranty support Any recommendations or feedback would be highly appreciated Back Story After a long while I have finally decided to upgrade my laptop but the current market dynamics is too confusing for me right now esp between currency hit price differences openbox deals and Maskedrefurbished options it has been difficult to decide on a laptop that truly fits my needs I would really appreciate some input from the community Current Setup Im currently using an HP ProBook 450 G5 8th Gen It has served me well but its beginning to show its age especially under heavier workloads Requirements Core Specifications Condition Brand new preferred CPU Intel i7 Hseries or equivalent or better RAM 24 GB 16 GB minimum with expansion slot no soldered ones Storage Must be SSD HDD option SSD 512 GB for OS second slot for future expansion is a plus HDD SATA 1 TB 25 inch Display At least IPS with decent color accuracy brightness GPU Nvidia RTX Ada series or something slightly stronger for rendering encodingdecoding performance I can work with gaming series but no older than 4000 series Ports and Connectivity Multiple USB ABC 2030 ports for accessories mouse external drives cooling stand 35 mm audio jack VGAHDMI port for external display RJ45 LAN port WiFi 45 GHz support Keyboard and Build Fullsize backlit keyboard numpad preferred Rigid build with minimal flex or hinge wobble Weight isnt an issue Easy to open for cleaning or upgrades Local parts availability for future maintenance Usage Pattern My workload involves heavy office use with constant multitasking often running numerous browser tabs alongside background tools for downloading and filesyncing Current system starts to lag with ram cpu reaching max capacity before apps start crashing I do not play games on the laptop as I have a ps5 pro for that so I dont require top end latest GPU Not Considering MacBooks due to hardwaresoftware compatibility issues with some custom tools I use Touchscreen 2in1 tablets flipbooks or handheld devices Desktops as I often work from multiple client offices and need portability Current Thoughts Ive been considering Lenovo ThinkPad T or P Series but many models seem to use TFT panels by default HP Victus models have good specifications but poor reviews regarding build quality screen wobble and keyboard flex Im also uncertain about Intel versus Ryzen options and would appreciate insights on that My goal is to move to at least an IPS panel since my current laptop has a TFT OLED would be ideal but likely beyond budget Budget Around 300000 PKR Important Points Models that offer the best balance of performance portability display build quality I would prefer numpad on keyboard but if laptop model is worth it then I can compromise as a trade off I know I might be asking for a lot but any advice or recommendations would really help Thanks to anyone who takes the time to share their thoughts"

        "See you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up The Lenovo is fast but the jitters and lag it has when doing realworld stuff are unacceptable for me at that price As I said comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021 they are neck and neck in realworld speed tests but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open playing 4k videos and video calling at the same time Yes the battery life is not great on my older HP but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo just doing what we have come to consider basic things like video calling when the Lenovo about aborted on me I think the Mediatek chip is ok but its not as powerful as they make it seem As I said in my review they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease and then it will be perfect",

        "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 which has been hyped up as the supreme being of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip Im just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively especially when something costs close to 800 This is an honest review no marketing fluff of just reading the specs I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel While I was overall impressed I think this machine is overhyped mainly because of the chip Its not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas Im coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9 with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which EATS UP anything I throw at it AI photovideo editing multi tasking video calls Thats my dream give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises So heres my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week alongside my trusty daily driver the HP Chromebook x360 14c i38GB RAM which is still a beast since 2021 Build Design The Lenovo is thin and light but solid It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality especially when typing Its so light it almost feels like a dummy unit but clearly isnt It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware Only downside The bottom is plastic so it lacks that full premium unibody feel But unless youre carrying it around a lot its a nonissue People mentioned keyboard flex but I didnt experience any in daily use And Im a weightlifter and former lineman with 105inch bear paws I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard The hinge is firm you cant open it with one hand but once open it holds its position perfectly Compared to the HP 14c the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter My HP is a full aluminum tank its been a champ for years The Lenovo feels like itll hold up but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time Build Grade A Battery Life Lets be real I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours But thats OK because I still got a solid 9105 hours under heavy realworld use 2030 tabs open Zoom app Teams web YouTube music streaming Constant typing Screen at 70 Compared to my aging HP which lasts about 45 hours now this is a major win For comparison the HP Dragonfly Pro 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours That thing didnt last the weekend before it went back Battery Grade A Keyboard Trackpad Fingerprint Reader Typing on this was a breeze even with my bear paws No real keyboard flex during regular use The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c but once I got into a groove I had no complaints Trackpad is large smooth and accurate feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness No lag no misclicks The fingerprint reader One of the best Ive used on a Chromebook or any computer I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger but nope still unlocked instantly Grade A Sound Speakers The Dolbybranded speakers had me hopeful but theyre great for a Chromebook but average overall My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water so its nothing special there They do have more depth than 99 of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall its still Chromebook speakers so they are decent in a small room The HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers but again good for a chrombook but in realworld usage they are just ok Grade C overall B for a Chromebook Chip Performance Kompanio Ultra 910 Heres where the hype train slows down In benchmarks Jetstream Speedometer this chip was twice as fast as my HPs i3 In realworld use Not really Its only slightly faster like a 051 second lead in page loads even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets Yes it wins technically but it was often a photo finish I ran into consistent problems using Teams in the browser Video calls would freeze the screen would stutter and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera Reddit confirms Im not alone on this Zoom via app worked fine but Teams was rough No such issues on my HP But the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience as some of the apps would be better on a fullscreen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone I tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called InShot and it temporarily presented a dream come true to have InShot on a laptop not a tablet with an added on keyboard where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15second 4k files and thats when it went to crap fast As soon as I added in a transition it became super laggy and jittery and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam it looks like it should work and has the same shape and characteristics but no it wont do at all AI features like background blur or object removal Not there yet Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets My last point about the chip is why not use past 12 year old true flagship chips that can do it all like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Galaxy Tab S9 series If they are going to charge such a premium price and say its because of the chip bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI multitasking video editing and more all at the same time and then Chrome OS would be a monster Grade B Screen Camera Now this screen WOW Its a 2K OLED panel thats absolutely beautiful I watched an 8K Planet Earth video on Youtube and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it The best screen Ive ever seen on a Chromebook Also they list the Lenovo at 400 nits but it feels much brighter than 400 I kept the screen constantly at 6070 and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases BUT a few things Some imagesweb pages looked oversaturated No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS The camera is also surprisingly good Not Galaxy Ultra good but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting Grade A Final Thoughts This is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks especially with ARM chips The design is sleek though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue the screen is stellar battery is excellent and it handles most tasks with ease For most users who use nothing but web apps Google Docs Office email YouTube this is more than enough People spending 2000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative BUT looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 this would be the nobrainer recommendation of the year for any laptop especially a Chromebook at 500 as 750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for 850 If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months and this goes down to 450550 for a new one run dont walk to get one if you need a new laptop At that price this is the nobrainer Chromebook of the decade Overall Grade B Me and my bear paws are off to test the next device",
        "Pls help me choose laptop 3 HI guys So im looking for laptop for only studying working and my girlie staff like binging netflix series at night so it doesnt need to be super powerfull but it should be compact I would love a device that would last me for years I narrowed it down to these 2 options which seems to suit my needs best 1 Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Ryzen 5 7535HS32GB5121TBWin11P 2 ASUS ZenBook 14 UM3406KA Ryzen AI 7 35016GB1TBW11P OLED 120Hz They both seem to be nice and well enough for my needs as im not gaming on laptop rather use Playstation The price diffrence between them is not as important to me as choosing one that would be a more solid option and would last at least 5 years 3 The main diffrence between them seems to be the processor ryzen 5 7535HS lenovo vs ryzen AI 7 ASUS Also the ASUS has OLED and I can see it is well reviewed but Im not sure I need it as much as I am not a laptopplaying kind of girl Also I read that there may by some technical problems with OLED such as burning in and I really cant afford service p and thats why I am looking for something reliable and for years I would love and appreciate any piece of advice 3 Thanksssss",
        "I really dont like my Zenbook I would recommend a 100200 eBay lenovo or the like and a pack of cute stickers to put on it its cheaper the keyboards feel better and theyre very unlikely to break or have issues Modern luxury laptops are usually unrepairable unreasonably expensive and have bad performance compared to super loud and hot gaming laptops of the same price If all youre looking to do is watch movies you could buy 10 eBay laptops to do it on for the price of one modern expensive one"

        "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v Price Performance The Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 714 performance increase Screen wobbling Some reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room However when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times for example the delete key Mousepad The glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions loudness brightness etc by a asus tool Quality variations The first model had a unproblematic mouspad The 2nd showed the follwing issue When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again the pad bounces up a tiny bit This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating Keyboard The keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example It has not much damping The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment I noticed not much flex only when forcefully pressing on the keys for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb Minor problems The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge Screen The screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 11800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks screen report before calibration screen report after calibration In both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen Speakers The sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass An wow the volume can be turned up to a very high level Noise The only point that was initially a minus was the fan which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do and the sharp spin up is very audible I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the Asus Fan Control V5 allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode Using the Asus Fan Control dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable Fan Control open source software Fingerprints Fingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver Overall As described the lower priced model can be a good priceperformance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption However when looking for a machine for media editingcreation I would reccommend the 32gb version At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards"
