        "HP Envy 15 4k OLED Review addressing common concerns EP00XX Series So I should preface this short review by saying I recently purchased the Envy 15 after about a month of researching laptops every day to find what I was looking for to replace my 10year old laptop For me I wanted a laptop that was sleeklooking has a glossy screen and has enough power for casual gaming In the end my decision came down to either the Envy 15 4k OLED or the Razer Blade 15 Base 2020 model with the 4k OLED Considering the Razer was going to be about 500600 more to only step up the 2060 Max Q to a 2070 Max Q GPU it didnt seem to be worth it to me So I decided on the Envy 15 and while I initially had a few concerns I could not be happier with my decision In short this is a great wellbuilt very wellbuilt and powerful laptop that has the most beautiful display of any laptop I have ever seen I have had no issues whatsoever in testing all of my casual PC uses web browsing youtube netflix microsoft office etc and gaming performance has been even better than expected Ive only run the new Microsoft Flight Simulator on it so far but it is an extremely graphically demanding game and Ive still been getting smooth frame rates at 1440p on high settings No other game I play is that demanding so for me performance could only go up from there The keyboard is great and the metal keys are such a nice change from the old plastic keys on my 2010 laptop Ive been looking for reasons to type stuff just so I can use this keyboard lol Since the reviews for this laptop were few in numbers I wanted to make this review to specifically address the common concerns that the few reviews that do exist point out Dented Keyboard I read in a couple of reviews that these units were being shipped with keyboards that were dentedin in the middle and suggested bad quality control I can only speak for my unit but I checked every row of the keyboard with a ruler and it was perfect No spacing or denting at all Display fuzziness or meshy layer Some of the reviews have also mentioned that this display has somewhat of a fuzzy or meshy look to it possibly due to the AMOLED technology in the panel One recent review suggests its to do with the arrangement of the pixels in the display panel After using the laptop for a few days all I can say is that maybe if you look hard enough very close on a solid white screen or very light color you might can see a little something But I have 2020 vision and damn near strained my eye balls trying to convince myself I was seeing this meshy layer or whatever lol This could just be from me being used to a 10 year old LED display but Ive been using this one for days and havent noticed anything other than the best laptop display Ive ever seen The colors are so vivid and the blacksdarks are super dark The colors are so vivid and the blacksdarks are super dark The best way I can describe the display is almost like a photo after its been enhanced and brought to life in Lightroom I have a 4k TV and have preferred watching Netflix on this the past few days just because it looks so good The reflection of the glossy screen really isnt as bad as some make it out to be although I prefer a glossy screen so that could just be my preference The only thing with the display is that one might need to use the Intel Graphics Command Center to brighten up the colors a smidge right out of the box Other than that its perfect in my opinion Sound not that loud I agree that right out of the box the laptop isnt that great on sound But thats because of the flat default preset in the Bang Olufsen Audio Control panel All you need to do is raise the treble equalizers near the top and slightly raise the bass levels and you will have some pretty great sound I couldnt imagine needing it any louder without wanting to connect to an external speaker at that level I do most browsing and watch netflix on around 6070 volume and it is plenty loud Fan Whine I have seen where some people have said that their fans have a terrible whine to them when spinning fast Again I can only speak from my experience but I havent had this issue at all People have said the fans get loud and they do I guess Again maybe its from me being used to a 10 year old laptop that didnt have this kind of performance but even on high I dont find the fans to be annoyingly loud or anything Sure you can hear them well But if youre playing a game the PC speakers pretty much drown out the sound of the fans or at least they do for me Temperature Some reviews have suggested this laptop gets too hot Ill agree that it does get hot but Ive had it on performance mode for a few hours at a time while gaming and I never found the unit top or bottom to be uncomfortably hot Certainly never to hot to put my hands on the keyboard or anything like Ive heard happens with the 2020 Razer 15 Hamstrung GPU I read one review from Micro Center that suggested the 2060 MaxQ GPU was hamstrung by the Intel Graphics which effectively limited the ability of the 2060 to be used by standard applications like a web browser The user said they couldnt fix it for anything so they sent it back One of the first things I did was change the Nvidia control panel to prefer the highend graphics in the global settings menu and have had no issue I can watch beautiful 4k video online with no issue or lost FPS and gaming has been no issue either like I mentioned previously As of now these were the main issues people seemed to list as potential defects that I could remember and checked against my unit If anyone else has anything they would like for me to check just comment and Ill be glad to do it These were the main concerns I had before purchasing but still decided to take a chance as Micro Center has a decent return policy and I like to believe reviews tend to come more from unhappy customers Hopefully if someone is on the fence with this laptop this review may clear up some of their concerns I really only have great things to say about this laptop and would recommend it to anyone who isnt solely focused on competitive gaming If youre a casual gamer like me that doesnt always need something crazy like 150FPS this computer can easily handle that on good settings as well as any of your standard PC applications all while showing it on a great display Youll just be limited to 60hz Im not really into 4k photo or video rendering but the benchmark scores for my unit suggest it can pretty easily handle that stuff as well In a nutshell Id have to say this is probably the best allaround laptop for 1500 For my purposes Id give a 1010"

        "What laptop should I get Im an engineering student who also works in research and coding and Im looking for a new laptop I was currently using my dads old ThinkPad T450s and it lasted 8 years and still works smoothly but the battery life has deteriorated a lot and its just not portable anymore Im looking for a new laptop on a more studentfriendly budget that would work well with VSCodeVim Linux and VMs Here are some of my choices ThinkPad Eseries 14 Intel Core Ultra 5 125U Processor Ecores up to 360 GHz Pcores up to 430 GHz 16GB RAM 512GB SSD Windows 11 Home Cost 689k I dont know much about the quality and performance of the ThinkPad Eseries though Since it has a Uprocessor Im a bit unsure about its performance Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 13th Gen Intel Core i713620H processor 16GB RAM LPDDR54800 512GB SSD expandable up to 1TB Cost 66k Honestly the processor seems good but Ive heard negative reviews about the build quality of IdeaPads MacBook Air Apple M1 chip 8GB RAM 256GB SSD storage Cost 59k Although Ive heard positive reviews of MacBook Airs from professionals the storage throws me off a bit and many people dont recommend them for college Some of the other laptops Ive considered are Lenovo LOQ and ASUS but these are my personal top choices If you guys have any suggestions for any other laptops or experience with any of the laptops listed above Id appreciate any advice",
        "I am also looking at laptops but I can say one thing for sure Do not buy a MacBook a lot of engineering software is not compatible or doesnt run well I get that they are attractive in terms of battery life and power but its just not good for this type of work I also noticed that intel works a bit better with low level programming and is a bit more stable with Linux The new intel CPUs are quite nice with battery life and performance From the laptops that you provided I would get the ThinkPad with intel 5 125U the performance is alright I am using a Ryzen 5 5600H and this intel is better in every way The build quality on ThinkPad was always ok the E series are a budget friendly for people that cant buy a T series or X1 Edit the CPU in the IdeaPad is going to be a bit more powerful in computing but the integrated graphics are way worse and the power efficiency is also worse so I guess if you value battery life and graphics the ultra is the obvious choice",
        "Ideapad Pro 55i or Yoga Pro 7 Total budget in local currency and country of purchase Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US 1500 AUD Australia Are you open to refurbsused Would prefer not to unless its exceptional How would you prioritize form factor ultrabook 2in1 etc build quality performance and battery life I would like a decent mix of all of the above battery life would be important as Id prefer to be less limited as a student How important is weight and thinness to you I am flexible but lighter would be better all else equal Do you have a preferred screen size If indifferent put NA 14 minimum but Ill take anything 15 or 16 gladly Are you doing any CADvideo editingphoto editinggaming List which programsgames you desire to run CAD yes video editingphoto editing no gaming would be nice but if the sacrifice is cost and battery life then probably not worth it for me I have access to consoles so I can live without for now If youre gaming do you have certain games you want to play At what settings and FPS do you want If I could play something like Cyberpunk Ghost of Tsushima on high or greater at 60FPS that would be a dream come true but if its limiting to a 23 hour battery it wouldnt be worth it to me Any specific requirements such as good keyboard reliable build quality touchscreen fingerprint reader optical drive or good input devices keyboardtouchpad Reliable build good keyboard and input devices would be ideal Couldnt care less about touch screen or finger print reader Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion My original post was going to be until I discovered the form Hello this is my first post so apologies if its not in the right space Im in Australia and in my second year out of five studying electricalengineering and computer science aidata science I know these laptops may be overkill for my coursework but I do need a laptop desktop isnt really an option need something portable and Im tired of the uni desktops freezingbuffering when I have excel and simulations open simultaneously My budget is 1500 AUD IdeaPad Pro 5i 16 Gen 9 larger 16 screen but slightly worse quality still OLED 400 nits 120Hz only has iGPU ram limited at 16GB soldered 84Wh battery IdeaPad Pro 5 14 Gen 10 AMD 14 screen but slightly better quality otherwise only has iGPU 24 to 32GB ram possible soldered 84Wh battery seems to have the best GPU from what I could compare at OR Yoga Pro 7 14 Gen 9 AMD 16GB ram soldered RTX 3050 GPU may be useful for basic ML hopefully in future or other graphically demanding tasks 145 IPS screen 350 nits and 90Hz 100 sRGB less battery 73Wh Im leaning towards the Yoga Pro 7 currently just as I figure the 16GB ram is probably enough and not having or being able to upgrade to having a GPU except external may give me issues But I would love to experience what is might feel like to have the 32GB ram if at all different Id also like decent battery otherwise I am tempted by options like ASUS TUF F15 DELL G15 Lenovo LOQ 15IRX9 Acer Nitro V 15 Thank you for any opinionsadvice on offer and for alleviating me of any ignorance I may hold Cheers"

        "Review The G18 and GSeries a laptop that somehow is worse than the sum of its parts TLDR The G18 looks like a good deal The specs suggest its a good deal But if youre moving it around the liquid metal that it uses instead of thermal paste will melt off and make it so your laptop will always be at 95 C constantly stutter and perform as if it were 10 years older in specs For context I chose this laptop because Im an outofstate college student who wanted to be able to game a little bit without bringing my desktop down and have decent battery life For the price tag and specs this thing looked like an amazing deal It was big but I was fine with that For the first month of using it it worked exactly as I imagined and was able to handle any game I threw at it incredibly wellElden Ring Armored Core 6 Ace Combat However once college started it began to have an issue that would be a constant theme in this story overheating Initially I didnt realize it was an overheating issue but I started getting intense screen tearing and stuttering on games I previously played fine I then chose lower load games which were fine for a day before similarly causing micro stutters and tearing I was trying to debug my GPU but after making some posts on the ROG Forum people pointed out my CPU was never below 95 C I was stuttering on every game to an unbearable degree and at times the screen would tear and become unusable and I had to restart I could not play Terraria without stuttering I sent it in to ASUS during my first break they repasted it It worked for a week and then it began having the same issue I sent it in again at the beginning of the summer they replaced the motherboard and it worked for the duration of the summer However a month into starting classes it began having the SAME issues but ASUS refused to take it back because it was past a year at this time I got it to a local shop he again repasted it it had issues a week later and then the guy broke the GPU somehow when I followed up and I just gave up and got a new laptop Now you could just say it was a single defective laptop however I had seen this same issue occur with two other people who had the G Series Overheating and screen tearing with one instance it got so bad it wouldnt boot up unless he had an ice pack under it The customer support was atrocious and I lost at least 100 hours waiting on chats and calls to go through the same steps to debug I CANNOT ADVISE THIS ENOUGH DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP OR ANY GSERIES For people stuck with this laptop I think the crux of this issue is from the liquid metal and moving around the laptop Over the summer my laptop didnt move around a lot and it was fine but in college it had the issues fairly quickly When I brought it in for local repair the liquid metal was pooled outside of the CPU cooler When he reapplied the liquid metal I purposefully tried to get it to have the same issue to see if it was actually fixedtilted the laptop to one side under heavy loads and lo and behold a week later it had issues He opened it up and the liquid metal was dripping off I wish I could report how it performed with thermal paste instead but in the process of repairing it the repair shop fucked up the GPU somehow and kept trying to blame it on me It had been a week and the GPU was active before I entered the shop left with the GPU not responding Once I get home I will see if I can fix it Ive had to buy a new laptop in the meantime though Examples of the many issues",
