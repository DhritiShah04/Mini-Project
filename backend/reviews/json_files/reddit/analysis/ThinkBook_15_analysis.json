        "Dell XPS 15 Review I have had my XPS 15 2017 model for about a year now so I figure its high time I share my thoughts on it fully Specs I78750H 16gb 512gb SSD GTX 1050Ti 4gb 4K Touch Monitor x200B The machine is sleek The aluminum on the chassis makes it feel rigid but the plastic interior makes it seem a little friendlier on the outside Its hard to beat the infinity edge display and with 4K touch its hard to not love it The biggest problem with the display is its ability to collect fingerprints but part of my noticing that is because I work in a naturally lit room so theyre very apparent to me The keyboard is phenomenal when it comes to productivity and my typing experience while writing papers and drafting documents was great Gaming however is a whole different thing The GPU would lead you to believe that it would be great for gaming but the truth is that for me the wrist rest on the laptop just made my arm hurt after more than about 10 minutes and by 30 minutes it isnt worth it to game anymore With gaming I actually found it a better experience to just use a crappy wired keyboard instead The trackpad is about what should be expected Not much more to say there The IO is unbeatable 2 USB type A and thunderbolt 3 USB C means that anything you need youre covered for Full sized HDMI came in handy more than once and it meant that I hardly ever had to carry around an adapter unless there was a very specific purpose for it The internals are nearly impossible to beat in a machine like this 16 gigs of ram is more than I think I ever needed and the 8th gen I7 can do anything you need it to and more With the GPU this laptop actually goes head to head with my desktop The biggest bottleneck for me was almost always the internet of where I am and not the internal specs Games run just as fast as they should on a laptop like this although usually I turned down the resolution a bit to give myself the extra details Instead of dealing with a 17 computer that has a 15 screen with an inch bezel on each side I actually have a 15 laptop and it feels nice Its not clunky except for in airplanes and fits in a bag just fine Its weight is comparable to a book that one might have in their bag and with the performance it packs it didnt bother me at all x200B Overall I have loved the past year with this machine and Ill have it until I manage to snag something else absolutely amazing by some stroke of luck It wasnt a hassle to carry around at all and it was functional beyond anything I ever needed I did have one issue with the SSD but Dell customer service was awesome and ended up sending me a new SSD then taking it in to replace the motherboard when that didnt work for absolutely no cost to me not even shipping Absolutely amazing service there For anyone who needs a machine that can do a little bit more than your average laptop this is certainly the way to go",
        "Any Reviews for ASUS M580VDEB76 VivoBook 156 FHD i77700HQ 16GB GTX 1050 Other than being a bit heavier and probably shorter battery life this Asus Vivobook seems to have similar specs to the XPS 15 and Yoga 720 Im thinking about getting an Aero 15 or XPS 15 for my next laptop as a developer and slightly more than occasional gamer who still wants the more professional aesthetic Lighter is definitely better but for half the price and maybe an extra half pound this might get the job done Any reviews out there for this model What would I be sacrificing here"

        "I think this laptop supports up to 64Gb of RAM so no problem there It depends The i7 is not the H series on gaming laptops with higher TDPs and 6 or 8 cores It is a U series which is designed for lighter tasks with 4 cores You must search and see if this CPU and iGPU suits you or not I dont have any experience with those softwares so I cant give any definite answers",
        "I havent read those reviews but those can be true mostly Lack of RJ45 is a pain yes Battery life is dependent on your usage Go for bigger battery model if available Cooling system is task dependent too In normal use day to day life it wont be a problem but gaming or other stressful tasks are a different story Thats it If it suits you go for it",
        "You should really try to test the performance on battery I have the same model and I noticed that the performance drastically decreases on battery so is the package power draw From 3537w while plugged in down to 25w for a short timeabout 10 seconds then down to 15w This decreases Cinebench R23 scores down to 7800 multicore but the one that suffers most is the GPU as it struggles to keep the clocks high enough for for it to be considered usable Any idea as to why did they artificially limit performance while competitors such as the Lenovo 7i Aura with the same CPU can keep the plugged in performance while on battery"

        "Review This 320 Laptop Really Impressed ASUS VivoBook 156 ASUS VivoBook 156 Model F512DAWH31 I purchased this laptop at Walmart At the time of writing this review it sits at 320 USD Lets start with the specs AMD Ryzen 3 3200U 4GB DDR4 Soldered but upgradeable 128GB SSD SATA 156 Screen TN 1920x1080 So for the price thats a decent chunk of hardware No its not going to blow minds but its certainly passable For background I was looking for a companion laptop to use around the house in addition to my normal workstation This seemed to fit the bill so I pulled the trigger CPU 2C4T Clockspeed 26 GHz Turbo Speed 35 GHz One of my main concerns with this laptop was going to be cooling and throttling Especially looking under the hood at the cooling solution they implemented BUT Wow Its does absolutely fine Running AIDA64 it held its turbo boost the entire time Temps went up to around 85 with a brief spike at 88 Turbo never strayed from the 35GHz Im shocked honestly Memory So out of the box there is 4GB 2600mhz soldered to the board There is however an open SODIMM slot that allows an additional 8GB DIMM to be installed I opted to drop an additional 4GB stick rather than an 8GB to maintain dual channel So while expandability is there you are limited with possible detriments if you break the dual channels Storage They kinda cut corners here with opting for a 128GB SATA drive rather than a NVME Its easily upgradable however so you could replace the SATA m2 with an NVME one if you so choose There is also an open 25 bay for a traditional SSD or HDD if you needed additional storage Screen This is where the price of this laptop really shows its face The TN panels viewing angles are Well they are terrible ESPECIALLY vertical viewing angles Color is passable when looking at just the right angle Otherwise its the worst part about this laptop I wouldnt recommend this laptop if you are looking for a media machine I will say they did an excellent job with the small boarders The form factor of the monitor is quite nice even if the panel isnt the best Keyboard Trackpad Its fantastic Honestly this might be one of the best chiclet keyboards I have ever used While I wish there was a bit more travel to the keys they feel responsive and typing is a breeze Key stabilization is very good The spacing is a bit odd especially on the top row F keys Delete The addition of a full numpad is always welcome The trackpad is large enough and responsive Not the best when compared to high end laptops but certainly when considering the price its very good Operating System I had to make a comment about this The computer ships with Windows 10 S for some reason Its easy enough to to go into the activation settings and move it into Windows Home for free There is a bit of bloatware installed but not enough to make me want to reinstall the OS A few minutes of uninstalling application takes care of that Oh and I almost forgot to mention WINDOWS HELLO IS INCLUDED Fingerprint scanner is integrated into the trackpad A WiFi Hey The addition of a genuine Intel wireless chip is nice Intel 8265ngw Battery Life I will update this review with battery life when I have had a bit more time with the computer to get a sense Build Quality No its not an all aluminium chassis I really wouldnt consider the computer a thin and light either even though its advertised as one While its not a chonky boy its not exactly thin and not the lightest Measures in at 20mm and 39 pounds Deck flex however is impressive While its not a Macbook it barely moves when putting a good amount of pressure on it The entire body seems really sturdy and doesnt budge Screen hinges are really good side note I think an added benefit of the lifting monitor design that Asus has been doing recently increased the stability and longevity of the hinges time will tell The screen itself has a bit more flex than I would like but its okay Not the greatest not the worst I have seen The exterior is a matte smooth plastic all around Not going to turn heads by any means and has the potential to be a scratch magnet if you are throwing into and out of a backpack all day although miles better than the glossy plastic laptops from a few years ago Conclusion Overall for the price of this laptop Im very impressed Quality hardware that will satisfy most casual workloads and keeps Windows 10 snappy upgradable components and a very impressive trackpad and keyboard make for a compelling purchase Obvious detractors are the TN panel and soldered 4GB RAM preventing more than 8GB without sacrificing losing dual channel memory",

        "Asus entry level laptop are cheap for a reason everything other than the motherboard start failing after 4 months I bough a new asus laptop x555lab i5 5200u 4gb ram 500gb hdd back in 2014 thinking that it is cheaper than the other brands so i must have got a good deal 4 months later the numpad failed so many repating keys so i had to use keytweak to disable that side of the keyboard Another 2 months and the speakers are dead no sign of damage they just died one day So far it has only been sitting on a table i dont carry it around I had a presentation one day so i bough it to class guess what battery is 30min there is supposed to be a chip that stop the battery from charging when it reached a certain point when plugged in that didnt work so no more battery Foward to 2017 i has been sitting on the same table which is dry cool no dust and no direct sunlight somehow an ant manage to slip through the gap at the bottom of the screen crawl inside died there and some months later its corpse decayed and damaged the pixels around it I had an assignment that require alot of typing and the some keys of the left side of the keyboard dont work anymore so i had it replaced with a replacement part from asus worked fine then i decided to put it away in a laptop bag in the desk drawer for 2 months since i bought a new laptop took it out and this time both the left and right side failed at the same time some keys repeated some doesnt even work so i replaced it again The battery was replaced at the same time as the first keyboard replacement same brand after 5 charge cycles batterymon it wont charge anymore and yes i did plug in and even borrowed someone elses charger too the port wasnt loose Replaced it again One day it was running slow checked the hard disk and turn out it has 8 bad sectors and speed is reduced compared to a brand new disk of the same modelcrystal disk mark 50 drop so i bought an ssd and put the hdd in the dvd player place Things that didnt fail was motherboard dvd player web cam the ports trackpad on board 4gb of ram Im very attentive to the stuff i use clean it often with microfiber cloth no liquid no drop didnt sit on it didnt overheat it since i mostly browse the web Compared to the fujitsu biblo fmv laptop i bought used in 2012 the thing never break except the battery and loose charging port every thing else worked perfectly good screen good keyboard the hard drive is still good only 2 bad sectors which is impressive since its an old ide drive and the laptop came out in 2007 Too bad the web is not core 2 duo t5600 183ghz even on lubuntu friendly so i took out the hard drive and sold the rest in 2019 since i had 3 laptops at the time The drive still works as an external hard drive in 2020 crazy I would stay clear of asus entry level laptop if i were you Good luck with your laptop and may it never fail",
        "Yes Im happy with the surface laptop Its not perfect but I dont have any major regrets I didnt consider the elitebook X g1a because it didnt have a haptic track pad and it has the split rightleft arrow keys with the page updown buttons which I despise Its an abomination Im using 150 scaling at full resolution and thats perfect for me No complaints there The coil whine is still present when plugged in but I dont really notice it anymore most of the time as Im usually very focused when Im working or have headphones on Im also on battery most of the time I think I noticed it for the first time in months just the other day So not bad I havent actually ever used the surface connect charger Its still wrapped up in the box I carry a single USBC charger and cable with me for all my devices and dont feel like carrying another It certainly would have been nice to have a USBc port on the right side of the laptop for this reason and its caused me an issue twice now but Ive learned to live with it The battery life is Okay I really dont know how reviewers are getting the insane battery life theyre reporting For my Macbook which I had used in an identical manner I was getting 50 or so more battery life out of it Thats really the only thing thats making me miss Apple For my overall work style their battery life is just superior",
        "Im looking at lots of posts and Im shocked at the budgets yall have Damn 2k I wish I had that kind of change My friend bought an Macbook Air last year with M4 chip she spent around 1500 Shes a casual user and not even in College anymore I told her to get the M1 Macbook Air but she said she wanted something future proof I think the M4 Macbook Air is overkill for a casual Fetching emails watching Youtube videos and surfing the web has never been processor intensive this wont be changing in 5 years My M1 processor will work just as well for these things in 5 years as they are now Not to mention in 3 years Ill be able to purchase that Macbook Air with M4 processor for 650 on eBay and Ill be all caught up I think anyone spending 2k on a laptop today for college is just crazy Its total overkill At this point youre simply spending for the sake of future proofing because theres no way you actually need all that power now You could spend a fraction of that on a Asus TUF with RTX 4050 can get around 650 used and that laptop really is future proof"

        "Dell XPS 15 Review I have had my XPS 15 2017 model for about a year now so I figure its high time I share my thoughts on it fully Specs I78750H 16gb 512gb SSD GTX 1050Ti 4gb 4K Touch Monitor x200B The machine is sleek The aluminum on the chassis makes it feel rigid but the plastic interior makes it seem a little friendlier on the outside Its hard to beat the infinity edge display and with 4K touch its hard to not love it The biggest problem with the display is its ability to collect fingerprints but part of my noticing that is because I work in a naturally lit room so theyre very apparent to me The keyboard is phenomenal when it comes to productivity and my typing experience while writing papers and drafting documents was great Gaming however is a whole different thing The GPU would lead you to believe that it would be great for gaming but the truth is that for me the wrist rest on the laptop just made my arm hurt after more than about 10 minutes and by 30 minutes it isnt worth it to game anymore With gaming I actually found it a better experience to just use a crappy wired keyboard instead The trackpad is about what should be expected Not much more to say there The IO is unbeatable 2 USB type A and thunderbolt 3 USB C means that anything you need youre covered for Full sized HDMI came in handy more than once and it meant that I hardly ever had to carry around an adapter unless there was a very specific purpose for it The internals are nearly impossible to beat in a machine like this 16 gigs of ram is more than I think I ever needed and the 8th gen I7 can do anything you need it to and more With the GPU this laptop actually goes head to head with my desktop The biggest bottleneck for me was almost always the internet of where I am and not the internal specs Games run just as fast as they should on a laptop like this although usually I turned down the resolution a bit to give myself the extra details Instead of dealing with a 17 computer that has a 15 screen with an inch bezel on each side I actually have a 15 laptop and it feels nice Its not clunky except for in airplanes and fits in a bag just fine Its weight is comparable to a book that one might have in their bag and with the performance it packs it didnt bother me at all x200B Overall I have loved the past year with this machine and Ill have it until I manage to snag something else absolutely amazing by some stroke of luck It wasnt a hassle to carry around at all and it was functional beyond anything I ever needed I did have one issue with the SSD but Dell customer service was awesome and ended up sending me a new SSD then taking it in to replace the motherboard when that didnt work for absolutely no cost to me not even shipping Absolutely amazing service there For anyone who needs a machine that can do a little bit more than your average laptop this is certainly the way to go",
        "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 which has been hyped up as the supreme being of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip Im just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively especially when something costs close to 800 This is an honest review no marketing fluff of just reading the specs I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel While I was overall impressed I think this machine is overhyped mainly because of the chip Its not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas Im coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9 with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which EATS UP anything I throw at it AI photovideo editing multi tasking video calls Thats my dream give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises So heres my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week alongside my trusty daily driver the HP Chromebook x360 14c i38GB RAM which is still a beast since 2021 Build Design The Lenovo is thin and light but solid It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality especially when typing Its so light it almost feels like a dummy unit but clearly isnt It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware Only downside The bottom is plastic so it lacks that full premium unibody feel But unless youre carrying it around a lot its a nonissue People mentioned keyboard flex but I didnt experience any in daily use And Im a weightlifter and former lineman with 105inch bear paws I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard The hinge is firm you cant open it with one hand but once open it holds its position perfectly Compared to the HP 14c the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter My HP is a full aluminum tank its been a champ for years The Lenovo feels like itll hold up but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time Build Grade A Battery Life Lets be real I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours But thats OK because I still got a solid 9105 hours under heavy realworld use 2030 tabs open Zoom app Teams web YouTube music streaming Constant typing Screen at 70 Compared to my aging HP which lasts about 45 hours now this is a major win For comparison the HP Dragonfly Pro 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours That thing didnt last the weekend before it went back Battery Grade A Keyboard Trackpad Fingerprint Reader Typing on this was a breeze even with my bear paws No real keyboard flex during regular use The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c but once I got into a groove I had no complaints Trackpad is large smooth and accurate feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness No lag no misclicks The fingerprint reader One of the best Ive used on a Chromebook or any computer I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger but nope still unlocked instantly Grade A Sound Speakers The Dolbybranded speakers had me hopeful but theyre great for a Chromebook but average overall My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water so its nothing special there They do have more depth than 99 of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall its still Chromebook speakers so they are decent in a small room The HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers but again good for a chrombook but in realworld usage they are just ok Grade C overall B for a Chromebook Chip Performance Kompanio Ultra 910 Heres where the hype train slows down In benchmarks Jetstream Speedometer this chip was twice as fast as my HPs i3 In realworld use Not really Its only slightly faster like a 051 second lead in page loads even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets Yes it wins technically but it was often a photo finish I ran into consistent problems using Teams in the browser Video calls would freeze the screen would stutter and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera Reddit confirms Im not alone on this Zoom via app worked fine but Teams was rough No such issues on my HP But the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience as some of the apps would be better on a fullscreen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone I tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called InShot and it temporarily presented a dream come true to have InShot on a laptop not a tablet with an added on keyboard where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15second 4k files and thats when it went to crap fast As soon as I added in a transition it became super laggy and jittery and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam it looks like it should work and has the same shape and characteristics but no it wont do at all AI features like background blur or object removal Not there yet Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets My last point about the chip is why not use past 12 year old true flagship chips that can do it all like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Galaxy Tab S9 series If they are going to charge such a premium price and say its because of the chip bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI multitasking video editing and more all at the same time and then Chrome OS would be a monster Grade B Screen Camera Now this screen WOW Its a 2K OLED panel thats absolutely beautiful I watched an 8K Planet Earth video on Youtube and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it The best screen Ive ever seen on a Chromebook Also they list the Lenovo at 400 nits but it feels much brighter than 400 I kept the screen constantly at 6070 and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases BUT a few things Some imagesweb pages looked oversaturated No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS The camera is also surprisingly good Not Galaxy Ultra good but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting Grade A Final Thoughts This is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks especially with ARM chips The design is sleek though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue the screen is stellar battery is excellent and it handles most tasks with ease For most users who use nothing but web apps Google Docs Office email YouTube this is more than enough People spending 2000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative BUT looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 this would be the nobrainer recommendation of the year for any laptop especially a Chromebook at 500 as 750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for 850 If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months and this goes down to 450550 for a new one run dont walk to get one if you need a new laptop At that price this is the nobrainer Chromebook of the decade Overall Grade B Me and my bear paws are off to test the next device"

        "I think this laptop supports up to 64Gb of RAM so no problem there It depends The i7 is not the H series on gaming laptops with higher TDPs and 6 or 8 cores It is a U series which is designed for lighter tasks with 4 cores You must search and see if this CPU and iGPU suits you or not I dont have any experience with those softwares so I cant give any definite answers",
        "Thanks for the feedback I did see the Thinkpad X9 Actually I would have bought it but for some reason I dont like the engine hub design I prefer an even thickness laptop This looks really weird to me But it looks like it might work for you Let me know how you like it I did consider snapdragon but like you I have a couple pieces of software that dont play well with them I tried so I decided I wanted to go lunar lake"
