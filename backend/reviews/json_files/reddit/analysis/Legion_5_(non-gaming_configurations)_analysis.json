        "Vostro 7510 Review Advice Request I really appreciated this and other reddit when I was searching for a laptop and wanted to return the favor with a quick review of this laptop I am not a formal laptop reviewer and dont have fancy gizmos to check nits or color accuracy but wanted to share I have only been using it for about a day or two and I may or may not post some updates as I use this more Theres also some chance that I will return it Model purchased on sale for 1150 10 CB I wouldnt mind some advice from the sub on whether to keep this or return for one of two slightly more gamery computers that will seemingly solve some of the issues I have with this either the Lenovo Legion 7 Slim or the HP Omen 161 AMD if it gets released on HPs site soon enough Background I joined a small business and needed a laptop I purchased my last laptop 11 years ago and while it aged gracefully thats like 85 in laptop years Business required that the laptop have Windows 10 Pro and preferred that it have biometric security I wanted it to be thin and have good build quality so it will hold up well I also wanted to be able to play the new AOE when it comes out ie light RTS and 4x type games Finally I needed the laptop yesterday so I didnt have time to wait around for the best deal Weaknesses I think this laptop falls short in a few ways 1 it spontaneously shut down the first day I was using it Enough battery updated Microsoft drivers and no indication of why when I turned it back on Not sure what it was but I updated the Dell drivers and it hasnt happened again in the few hours of use since that 2 Battery life could be better once I was down to less than 40 after about 3 hours of nongaming use downloading and installing some applications light browsing As I type this I have 256 estimated remaining at 77 of the battery on better battery setting The battery estimate was also all over the place I dont think its fair to expect much more out of a 56 whr battery but I think it is fair to expect more than a 56 whr battery in this kind of laptop 3 The keyboard is ok typing feels nice enough although I liked my old Lenovos keyboard a little bit better The backlighting is a joke 4 Cooling I ran Offworld Trading Company which was free from Epic Games at the time I received this computer and after less than 15 minutes of play I found the palm rest to be warm and using a food thermometer found the temperature to be over 100 fahrenheit on the speakers and about 127 fahrenheit right underneath the vents The fans were noticeably loud as well Task manager says the GPU got up to 65c That seemed pretty warm for a few minutes of play on a 5 year old game Strengths The strengths are in the specs i7 with a 3050ti aluminum chassis there is a very thin plastic bezel around the screen but its small enough to get over Pretty good build quality Touchpad is spacious Its relatively heavy for a 2021 laptop but it has a dGPU and is pretty thin Screen is pretty nice and color accurate although I suspect nothing special in 2021 And I will be able to play aoe4 on this when it comes out Dell Customer Service I also wanted to call out a good experience with Dell Customer Service Without getting into the details they made things right quickly and followed up to make sure things ended up ok Request for Advice When I was looking at this I was also between the Lenovo Legion 7 slim which is a few hundred dollars more but has a higher refresh screen and the 3060 I decided that because I am looking to play RTS4x games that are typically not AAA graphically intensive a 3050 would be enough and I would be better saving the money I was also considering the new HP Omen AMD 161 but it still hasnt been released on HPs website where they have frequent 10 off gaming PC sales and given that I need something now I may not be able to wait until they can ship it Now that I have used the Vostro and have pointed out the above concerns do you think Ill get a significantly better battery life on one of those other options and b is the cooling significant enough to cause problems with my use of the Dell",
        "Hi there have you been able to play AoE4 on it since the release of the game and would you recommend this laptop for this game I am looking for a decent laptop for everiday tasks with a moderate price and not especially oriented for gaming but I would love to be able to run AoE4 but no other AAA games that are massively demanding on GPU CPU and memory",
        "To tell the truth I didnt run it more than a few hours on win10 I did find turning on battery saver made a difference but it wasnt major enough I did also find apps like the brave browser automatically using the dGPU for no reason setting windows to force it into the iGPU helped a bit I did run manjero Linux and was getting batter battery life than when 11 but maybe just an extra 30 mins of light usage Over all I think the battery capacity 56Wh is just a bit too low for something with an 11800h and dGPU I tried buying an 86Wh battery from Dell before sending the Vostro back but they dont have them in stock I moved to a Lenovo P1 G4 That has a 91wH battery Its easy to get 455 hours on that thing without effort Edit more info"
