        "swift go 14 sfg147253bp 125H OLED UPDATE 4 months later i love love love it its perfect for me a 14 MBP that can do everything that i could ever imagine no problems thus far fingerscrossed i was writing a comment on Im planning on getting the Acer Swift Go 14 with the oled screen is this a good idea and basically ended up writing a review so I just got the 125H version misposted as 135H off eBay for 550 like newopen box Its incredible especially when coming from a limiting chromebook and an even more limiting iPad mini lol The 125H goes for 850 and the 155H goes for 1000 on the Acer US store of note the older Acer Swift X 13500H RTX 3050 version an older nontouch IPS screen is going for 800 new Thats a significantly better gpu but likely more powerhungry and perhaps limited by the 65w battery and even 100w charger but who knows those AMD ryzens seem to do way better than the intels of their time Highly likely to find one going for a low price compared to bigger names The next jump is at 1300 for a new swift go 14 155H rtx 4050 heres a quick useful video review about it major notes the version with the OLED screen does not have touch input I found this out the hard way I guess i assumed that the swifts go series was like flipbook and spin in that the touchscreen is its main feature without the flippingspinning part I was wrong the 155H version has touchscreen SFG1472T71QF along with a 16 version Look for the icon with a finger pointing major cons the battery life is lower compared to other ultrabooks maybe 610 hours vs 1014 hours zenbook perhaps due to the 65w vs 75w battery I cant say yet and maybe windows and its bloatware is still doing something but i got 10 hours on my first three charges draining at 10hour But i also always use minimum brightness and just had the normal 30 tabs open edge most tabs sleeping with music playing Conversely perhaps because it has a smaller battery it charges very very quickly an hour or so with the given charger Its also nice that usbc was standardized for charging though i wished the usbc cable would detach from the power block A minor gripe After the first few drains ive kept the laptop charged and used some preinstalled Acer program to limit charging when pluggedin to 80 no choice This really is its only major con the OLED is glossy so glossy you can see a deep deep and rich reflection of yourself Its like looking into a dark mass of water It raises selfawareness and horror coldface problems likely similar to other ultrabooks and other notes fan noise and heat when it speeds up its clearly audible in a quiet bedroom when it starts up it can start with very little computering the zenbook got panned in a review for being worse then it goes back to silent mode and thankfully stays silent And when its silent its absolutely silent Its apparently not louder than its competitors tho sounds fine to me Thank goodness Along with fan noise it can get a little warm at the palms I think this happened during the beginning of it charging Thankfully the aluminum case ensures it cools down quickly and keeps it cool this is my portabledesktoplaptop wherein i plan to use a separate mechanical keyboard most of the time anyway However when its not charging it seems to stay quiet n cool which is the most important time the speakers are bassless but the amp is surprisingly incredible but then again ive never heard good laptop speakers in my life Zero bass which im okay with as im a dreamypop treble music person but just say no to loficitypop Its interesting to hear bass guitars without the bass It reminds me of my old purple n gold ATHAD700 headphones that i adore but far worse mixing The audio goes through some artificial spatial surround sound software the mids seem to live recessed in the bottom center of the laptop vocals then are overtly forwarded to every direction speaker in the artificial speaker system piano the highs are all over the place moving from one part of the laptop to another and the lows remind me of bad midi music Your favorite music will not move you You will however listen to your favorite music in a very different way Having said that the speakers can get very loud easily able to fill up a room and most importantly beyerdynamic 300r 32ohm headphones sound great at a mere 10 volume the up and down arrow keys share a single key area I use wasd for gaming so it doesnt bother me This also keeps the keyboards shape to a neat rectangle the left modifier keys arent big theyre the same size as the letter n number keys The right modifier keys however are slightly wider They had to do this to make space for the function key UPDATE i remappedswapped leftcontrol with leftalt macstyle much better ill likely remap holding capslock to leftcontrol too the keys feel only slightly better than my 40 samsung chromebook 4 which now that im looking at it surprisingly has the big fat left modifier keys and complete arrow keys too Not bad that thing for programmers the tilde key and delete keys are nice to have and nicely placed as are the halfsize functionspecial keys tho im scared of what bloatware the acer key will manifest UPDATE in retrospect its actually a great keyboard I ordered a keychron k6 and those red keys are god awful Seriously who wants to press a key down for a onehalf inch Ive become used to the tiny distance of laptop keyboards the 14 screen is a huge surprise coming from an 116 chromebook 24 is a lot and even the 133 macbook yet its dimensions are only very slightly larger 1 Theres about an inch of empty space on both sides of the keyboardIm the sort of person who saw the 15 Macbook and thought ugh what is all that space for and didnt buy one until the 13 came out The massive OLED screen gets as close as youd want to the edgesany closer your fingerprints would smudge the beautiful screen when openingclosing it As does the massive trackpad the bigger touchpad may cause more accidents I havent had enough experience but thus far it seems fine for my hands for the most part I did have had it click on random parts of this review im writing quite a few times but then again im currently sitting at a bad angle UPDATE i love it bigger is better i must have gotten used to it as i dont accidentally touch it anymore the ports are perfect for me as im not updated on current technology two thunderbolt new to me two usbone on each side one hmdi a headphone jack an sd card reader and a good ol kensington lock lol Ive never used a lock before but have always found it intriguing I feel the port choices are very oldschool like me It might be possible for 4 displays for this chip note smaller 133 laptops can compromise on ports bloatware after 20 years this still exists Why McAfee still exists I did however use the 1 year of 100GB dropbox Could someone please ship me a usb flash drive or sd card so that i can reinstall windows with all the similar ultrabooks Asus zenbook Lenovo yoga HP spectre Dell xps 14 maybe even the lowerend Acer spin Asus flipbook Asus vivobook HP pavilion plus Dell inspiron plus n so on i felt its pretty hard to decide on one and just went with what good deals i found on eBay and checked the review on notebookcheck and doublechecked that the specs are indeed ultra weight size build qualitynot plastic its direct local to Taiwan competition is the asus zenbook and i actually think thats a better notebook Better speakers better keyboard i prefer big keys over the macbook chicletstyle betters looks premium business ultrabook vs macbook clone lighter an insane 13kg and most importantly a better battery 75w vs 65w 12 hours vs 8 in tests but notebookchecks review noted a fan noise problem due to it having a single fan heatsink vs this Acers double fan n heatsink The problem could just be a fluke but def worth researching other users experiences about it Beyond that single problem though i def prefer the zenbook However if a macbook clone is what youre really into this Acer is just that a 14 Macbook Pro possibly for half the price due to bad resale value i personally chose the Intel ultra series for its great gamespower balance and x64 architecture I missed out on the entire AMD marathon An older asus rog flow x13 g14 doesnt have touchscreen razer blade 14 or microsoft surface pro intel ultra series not the newer ARM arch models would have been my top choices if i were to accept something more used The previous gen surfaces were way too expensive But im super stoked with what i got for 550 Wow Also i love Taiwan made in Taiwan 3 so Acer n Asus were actually my top choices they do all the hard work of making everything and are absolutely lovely people with an incredible culture to behold so let them have all my monies Actually ive been fond of the swift series laptops particularly swift 3 series and 5 series ever since that time i went to a physical store to test n compare laptops They were by far the best deals in the budget range They were all ultrabooks in my eyes for a fraction of the price of one the OLED is stunning Now theres absolutely no need for a Macbook for me My last one was a late201313 MBP Hello again Windows How ive missed you dearly And oh my how youve accepted Linux I dont even need Linux anymore and thats coming from Arch Also having done some programming i cant justify the sufferings that Apple has made programmers go through over its reign Microsoft has since made a big turn towards accepting opensource linux programmers etc Strange but good i hope for my personal needs the lowerresolution IPS touchscreen wouldve been ideal for both touch input and possibly better gaming performance does native resolution matter nowadays It is indeed a major bummer However i feel that without the the ability to swivel the screen around convertible it wouldve made an odd touchscreen experience anyway quite different from tablets Also very important to note theres quite a few touchscreen OLED notebooksincluding the zenbook that suffer from a grainy screen problemthough i dont know which exact models year have this problem So in the end i feel it was more of a blessing Anyway im hoping my next job will pay for a premium laptop At the moment if money were not a factor id go for either the Asus rog flow x13 or dreamy z13 The z13 is all ive ever dreamed for ever since the iPad came out but ive read that even the z13 suffers from a very low battery life UPDATE now that ive got OLED i cant imagine ever going back oo so if i were to choose again a new 2022 asus rog flow x13 ryzen 7940HS would have been my choice and very very surprisingly its going for a mere 800 So unless you find a deal like mine you should just go for one of the best out there Otherwise this is an incredibly solid laptop for its price It has also easily convinced me macbooks arent worth it anymore as it was a decade ago even considering the newer ARM Mseries Im a believer of AcerAsusTaiwan"

incredibly solid laptop for its price It has also easily convinced me macbooks arent worth it anymore as it was a decade ago even considering the newer ARM Mseries Im a believer of AcerAsusTaiwan"

        "How about Ideapad 5 Pro for 850 vs M1 Mac Air with 16256 for 1137 and a 150 gift card Im going to use it for my research tasks for example using three browsers and keeping at least 15 tabs in each of them open simultaneously and running one word processor thats it I can deal with external storage without any issues What would be the actual battery backup of the 6600HS version My primary requirement is longevity that it should at least survive my multiple browser tabs for 5 to 6 years I have been using one IdeaPad 330S 14 by Lenovo with 8 GB of RAM and 512 SSD with one TB hard drive and extremely poor battery life that is for 35 hours and Ive been using it for a 3 year and 8 months Do you think if I do not take Apple Care Plus then I should not be touching Mac and I would be better off with one Windows device I dont use any Apple products Fixing Apple with out of pocket is surely scary But I just cant find a Windows alternative with similar battery life While Apple is asking significantly more money for less RAM and storage but yes I understand that there are things beyond RAM SSD for which they are doing it I have been used to cheap Windows machines so much that I am pretty reluctant to pay 850 for a Windows machine I am building this argument in my head that if I am going to pay above 850 then it shouldnt be a Windows machine But then comes the back and forth discussion on what are you getting for your money actually It is frustrating I still cant decide"

        "swift go 14 sfg147253bp 125H OLED UPDATE 4 months later i love love love it its perfect for me a 14 MBP that can do everything that i could ever imagine no problems thus far fingerscrossed i was writing a comment on Im planning on getting the Acer Swift Go 14 with the oled screen is this a good idea and basically ended up writing a review so I just got the 125H version misposted as 135H off eBay for 550 like newopen box Its incredible especially when coming from a limiting chromebook and an even more limiting iPad mini lol The 125H goes for 850 and the 155H goes for 1000 on the Acer US store of note the older Acer Swift X 13500H RTX 3050 version an older nontouch IPS screen is going for 800 new Thats a significantly better gpu but likely more powerhungry and perhaps limited by the 65w battery and even 100w charger but who knows those AMD ryzens seem to do way better than the intels of their time Highly likely to find one going for a low price compared to bigger names The next jump is at 1300 for a new swift go 14 155H rtx 4050 heres a quick useful video review about it major notes the version with the OLED screen does not have touch input I found this out the hard way I guess i assumed that the swifts go series was like flipbook and spin in that the touchscreen is its main feature without the flippingspinning part I was wrong the 155H version has touchscreen SFG1472T71QF along with a 16 version Look for the icon with a finger pointing major cons the battery life is lower compared to other ultrabooks maybe 610 hours vs 1014 hours zenbook perhaps due to the 65w vs 75w battery I cant say yet and maybe windows and its bloatware is still doing something but i got 10 hours on my first three charges draining at 10hour But i also always use minimum brightness and just had the normal 30 tabs open edge most tabs sleeping with music playing Conversely perhaps because it has a smaller battery it charges very very quickly an hour or so with the given charger Its also nice that usbc was standardized for charging though i wished the usbc cable would detach from the power block A minor gripe After the first few drains ive kept the laptop charged and used some preinstalled Acer program to limit charging when pluggedin to 80 no choice This really is its only major con the OLED is glossy so glossy you can see a deep deep and rich reflection of yourself Its like looking into a dark mass of water It raises selfawareness and horror coldface problems likely similar to other ultrabooks and other notes fan noise and heat when it speeds up its clearly audible in a quiet bedroom when it starts up it can start with very little computering the zenbook got panned in a review for being worse then it goes back to silent mode and thankfully stays silent And when its silent its absolutely silent Its apparently not louder than its competitors tho sounds fine to me Thank goodness Along with fan noise it can get a little warm at the palms I think this happened during the beginning of it charging Thankfully the aluminum case ensures it cools down quickly and keeps it cool this is my portabledesktoplaptop wherein i plan to use a separate mechanical keyboard most of the time anyway However when its not charging it seems to stay quiet n cool which is the most important time the speakers are bassless but the amp is surprisingly incredible but then again ive never heard good laptop speakers in my life Zero bass which im okay with as im a dreamypop treble music person but just say no to loficitypop Its interesting to hear bass guitars without the bass It reminds me of my old purple n gold ATHAD700 headphones that i adore but far worse mixing The audio goes through some artificial spatial surround sound software the mids seem to live recessed in the bottom center of the laptop vocals then are overtly forwarded to every direction speaker in the artificial speaker system piano the highs are all over the place moving from one part of the laptop to another and the lows remind me of bad midi music Your favorite music will not move you You will however listen to your favorite music in a very different way Having said that the speakers can get very loud easily able to fill up a room and most importantly beyerdynamic 300r 32ohm headphones sound great at a mere 10 volume the up and down arrow keys share a single key area I use wasd for gaming so it doesnt bother me This also keeps the keyboards shape to a neat rectangle the left modifier keys arent big theyre the same size as the letter n number keys The right modifier keys however are slightly wider They had to do this to make space for the function key UPDATE i remappedswapped leftcontrol with leftalt macstyle much better ill likely remap holding capslock to leftcontrol too the keys feel only slightly better than my 40 samsung chromebook 4 which now that im looking at it surprisingly has the big fat left modifier keys and complete arrow keys too Not bad that thing for programmers the tilde key and delete keys are nice to have and nicely placed as are the halfsize functionspecial keys tho im scared of what bloatware the acer key will manifest UPDATE in retrospect its actually a great keyboard I ordered a keychron k6 and those red keys are god awful Seriously who wants to press a key down for a onehalf inch Ive become used to the tiny distance of laptop keyboards the 14 screen is a huge surprise coming from an 116 chromebook 24 is a lot and even the 133 macbook yet its dimensions are only very slightly larger 1 Theres about an inch of empty space on both sides of the keyboardIm the sort of person who saw the 15 Macbook and thought ugh what is all that space for and didnt buy one until the 13 came out The massive OLED screen gets as close as youd want to the edgesany closer your fingerprints would smudge the beautiful screen when openingclosing it As does the massive trackpad the bigger touchpad may cause more accidents I havent had enough experience but thus far it seems fine for my hands for the most part I did have had it click on random parts of this review im writing quite a few times but then again im currently sitting at a bad angle UPDATE i love it bigger is better i must have gotten used to it as i dont accidentally touch it anymore the ports are perfect for me as im not updated on current technology two thunderbolt new to me two usbone on each side one hmdi a headphone jack an sd card reader and a good ol kensington lock lol Ive never used a lock before but have always found it intriguing I feel the port choices are very oldschool like me It might be possible for 4 displays for this chip note smaller 133 laptops can compromise on ports bloatware after 20 years this still exists Why McAfee still exists I did however use the 1 year of 100GB dropbox Could someone please ship me a usb flash drive or sd card so that i can reinstall windows with all the similar ultrabooks Asus zenbook Lenovo yoga HP spectre Dell xps 14 maybe even the lowerend Acer spin Asus flipbook Asus vivobook HP pavilion plus Dell inspiron plus n so on i felt its pretty hard to decide on one and just went with what good deals i found on eBay and checked the review on notebookcheck and doublechecked that the specs are indeed ultra weight size build qualitynot plastic its direct local to Taiwan competition is the asus zenbook and i actually think thats a better notebook Better speakers better keyboard i prefer big keys over the macbook chicletstyle betters looks premium business ultrabook vs macbook clone lighter an insane 13kg and most importantly a better battery 75w vs 65w 12 hours vs 8 in tests but notebookchecks review noted a fan noise problem due to it having a single fan heatsink vs this Acers double fan n heatsink The problem could just be a fluke but def worth researching other users experiences about it Beyond that single problem though i def prefer the zenbook However if a macbook clone is what youre really into this Acer is just that a 14 Macbook Pro possibly for half the price due to bad resale value i personally chose the Intel ultra series for its great gamespower balance and x64 architecture I missed out on the entire AMD marathon An older asus rog flow x13 g14 doesnt have touchscreen razer blade 14 or microsoft surface pro intel ultra series not the newer ARM arch models would have been my top choices if i were to accept something more used The previous gen surfaces were way too expensive But im super stoked with what i got for 550 Wow Also i love Taiwan made in Taiwan 3 so Acer n Asus were actually my top choices they do all the hard work of making everything and are absolutely lovely people with an incredible culture to behold so let them have all my monies Actually ive been fond of the swift series laptops particularly swift 3 series and 5 series ever since that time i went to a physical store to test n compare laptops They were by far the best deals in the budget range They were all ultrabooks in my eyes for a fraction of the price of one the OLED is stunning Now theres absolutely no need for a Macbook for me My last one was a late201313 MBP Hello again Windows How ive missed you dearly And oh my how youve accepted Linux I dont even need Linux anymore and thats coming from Arch Also having done some programming i cant justify the sufferings that Apple has made programmers go through over its reign Microsoft has since made a big turn towards accepting opensource linux programmers etc Strange but good i hope for my personal needs the lowerresolution IPS touchscreen wouldve been ideal for both touch input and possibly better gaming performance does native resolution matter nowadays It is indeed a major bummer However i feel that without the the ability to swivel the screen around convertible it wouldve made an odd touchscreen experience anyway quite different from tablets Also very important to note theres quite a few touchscreen OLED notebooksincluding the zenbook that suffer from a grainy screen problemthough i dont know which exact models year have this problem So in the end i feel it was more of a blessing Anyway im hoping my next job will pay for a premium laptop At the moment if money were not a factor id go for either the Asus rog flow x13 or dreamy z13 The z13 is all ive ever dreamed for ever since the iPad came out but ive read that even the z13 suffers from a very low battery life UPDATE now that ive got OLED i cant imagine ever going back oo so if i were to choose again a new 2022 asus rog flow x13 ryzen 7940HS would have been my choice and very very surprisingly its going for a mere 800 So unless you find a deal like mine you should just go for one of the best out there Otherwise this is an

        "Ideapad 5 Pro with Ryzen 6600HS Thoughts I spotted the Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro Part 82SJ0005US sitting at 740 on Lenovos website today which feels like a pretty low price for a laptop with a Ryzen 6000 series CPU 16GB RAM and a 1 TB SSD Im curious about the 6600HS specifically since I can barely find any review of laptops that use it Based on the higher TDP Id expect it to outperform the 6600U Does anyone have experience with a laptop containing the 6600HS Id also be interested to know how the battery life is with a 35 W TDP chip Thanks",

missed out on the entire AMD marathon An older asus rog flow x13 g14 doesnt have touchscreen razer blade 14 or microsoft surface pro intel ultra series not the newer ARM arch models would have been my top choices if i were to accept something more used The previous gen surfaces were way too expensive But im super stoked with what i got for 550 Wow Also i love Taiwan made in Taiwan 3 so Acer n Asus were actually my top choices they do all the hard work of making everything and are absolutely lovely people with an incredible culture to behold so let them have all my monies Actually ive been fond of the swift series laptops particularly swift 3 series and 5 series ever since that time i went to a physical store to test n compare laptops They were by far the best deals in the budget range They were all ultrabooks in my eyes for a fraction of the price of one the OLED is stunning Now theres absolutely no need for a Macbook for me My last one was a late201313 MBP Hello again Windows How ive missed you dearly And oh my how youve accepted Linux I dont even need Linux anymore and thats coming from Arch Also having done some programming i cant justify the sufferings that Apple has made programmers go through over its reign Microsoft has since made a big turn towards accepting opensource linux programmers etc Strange but good i hope for my personal needs the lowerresolution IPS touchscreen wouldve been ideal for both touch input and possibly better gaming performance does native resolution matter nowadays It is indeed a major bummer However i feel that without the the ability to swivel the screen around convertible it wouldve made an odd touchscreen experience anyway quite different from tablets Also very important to note theres quite a few touchscreen OLED notebooksincluding the zenbook that suffer from a grainy screen problemthough i dont know which exact models year have this problem So in the end i feel it was more of a blessing Anyway im hoping my next job will pay for a premium laptop At the moment if money were not a factor id go for either the Asus rog flow x13 or dreamy z13 The z13 is all ive ever dreamed for ever since the iPad came out but ive read that even the z13 suffers from a very low battery life UPDATE now that ive got OLED i cant imagine ever going back oo so if i were to choose again a new 2022 asus rog flow x13 ryzen 7940HS would have been my choice and very very surprisingly its going for a mere 800 So unless you find a deal like mine you should just go for one of the best out there Otherwise this is an incredibly solid laptop for its price It has also easily convinced me macbooks arent worth it anymore as it was a decade ago even considering the newer ARM Mseries Im a believer of AcerAsusTaiwan",
        "I can hear fan noise for a few seconds each time I turn on the Acer Swift Go laptop that I purchased from Costco However its generally very silent when watching youtube videos browsing the web and doing office work Can the fan noise be permanently controlled via BIOS if I wanted to install Linux on the system or is one forced to use the AcerSense app Frankly though Ive been spoiled by the Thinkpad laptops X230 T450 and T460s which are really silent I would have continued to use the T450 and T460s laptops had not Microsoft refused to support Windows 11 on those machines Are HPAsusAcer laptops generally noiser"
