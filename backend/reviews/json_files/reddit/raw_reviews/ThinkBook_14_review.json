  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the ‚Äúsupreme being‚Äù of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I‚Äôm just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It‚Äôs not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I‚Äôm coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which¬†**EATS UP**¬†anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That‚Äôs my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here‚Äôs my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the¬†[HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/)¬†(i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# üîß Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn‚Äôt. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you‚Äôre carrying it around a lot, it‚Äôs a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn‚Äôt experience any in daily use. And I‚Äôm a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can‚Äôt open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it‚Äôs been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it‚Äôll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# üîã Battery Life\n\nLet‚Äôs be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that‚Äôs OK, because I still got a solid 9‚Äì10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20‚Äì30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4‚Äì5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the¬†[HP Dragonfly Pro¬†](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn‚Äôt last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? üî• One of the best I‚Äôve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# üîä Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they‚Äôre great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ‚ö° Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere‚Äôs where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP‚Äôs i3. In real-world use? Not really. It‚Äôs only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI¬†**ran into consistent problems**¬†using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I‚Äôm not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called¬†[InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# üì∫ Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It‚Äôs a 2K OLED panel that‚Äôs absolutely beautiful. I watched an¬†[8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1)¬†and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I‚Äôve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT‚Ä¶ a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT‚Ä¶ looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one,¬†**run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube‚Äînot that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop. Having good speakers is a great bonus for the Lenovo for me, as well as a bright screen. Don't need maximum power as for heavy workload I want to rely on remote desktops.",
  "A brief review of the HP OmniBook X Flip 14 2-in-1 with AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 This is a very brief review of the HP OmniBook X Flip 14 2-in-1 with AMD Ryzen AI 5 340. I don't have the interest to do a full review, and there's plenty of big reviews already out there, so here's the quick version.\n\nHere we go.\n\nI got this laptop for $350 as a Best Buy Open-box return. That was a great deal. I don't think I would pay more than $550 for this laptop but it looks like it's mostly listed between $600-$700 right now.\n\nIt's a lower-mid range laptop that isn't terrible. It would be great for school, work, or if you just can't afford anything better.\n\nThis is a Model 14-FK0013DX, SKU 6613861, UPC 198990145419, BSIN JJGQJRKGHK, Product ID B5UJ0UA#ABA, Product # AK5G4AV_1.\n\nhttps://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-omnibook-x-flip-14-inch-2-in-1-laptop-next-gen-ai-pc-pdk-ak5g4av\n\nThe AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 CPU is a pretty great value. It's performance is better than expected with 6 cores and 12 threads, but it's GPU is a little below average. I'm sure you can play some games, but this isn't a gaming laptop. Unfortunately, the higher CPU performance seems to come at the expense of battery life, but that's not a terrible tradeoff to make. Get a battery bank.\n\nThe 512GB NVME drive in mine is a full size 2280 WD SN500, but you could end up with a Samsung or something else.\n\nThe screen is average. You get what you pay for here and I can't complain for the price. It's a little grainier than I would like, the colors are okay but not great, and the brightness is okay but not great, but it's a good value panel.\n\nThe body is very nice. It has a good look and better-than-expected feel. It is a little heavier than expected.\n\nI am a Linux user, so I don't even bother mentioning any potential Windows issues. You should always do a full reinstall anyway to wipe out all of the crappy OEM bloatware.\n\nAlmost everything worked perfectly in the Linux distros I've tested. Be sure to use something recent. The touchpad, keyboard, and Wifi won't work well without a recent kernel. The one thing that wasn't working was fan sensor reporting, but other thermal information seemed to be correct.\n\nPhoronix has a review of a similar laptop if you want benchmarks. I imagine the results should be very similar\n\nhttps://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen-ai-5-340\n\nhttps://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-krackan-point-windows-linux\n\nIf you want to boot linux, go into the UEFI and enable Boot Options > Enable MS UEFI CA key and disable Secure Boot.\n\n\"Word of warning - disabling Pluton can break suspend/resume\"\n\nThe ports are fine. There's no Thunderbolt, but you get a USB4 port. I wish there was a USB-C port on each side for charging from the right.\n\nFlipping the lid open could be easier. There's nowhere to catch your finger onto to pry it apart.\n\nThe touchpad is a good size and clicks great. The surface is a little rough and it's plastic instead of glass, but it works.\n\n[The one thing I will complain about is the keyboard. I hate it. If you are a touch typist just get something else. If you are slow and don't care, then it's fine.](https://old.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1mytqff/the_hp_omnibook_x_flip_14_14fk0013dx_keyboard_is/)\n\nThe power button is on the keyboard, displacing the DEL key. I hate that too.\n\n~~And finally, the FN key has an LED light that never goes out. It's bugged. There's even a thread about it on the HP support site. You can't turn it off. What's the point other than wasting power and being annoying? Nothing.~~ UPDATE: I was wrong about the annoying FN key LED. It turns off as long as you have it set to \"Auto\" in the UEFI. However, the meaning of \"Auto\" is very unintuitive. It's definitely annoying when it's on though, and there's a reason why almost every other manufacture keeps the two keys needed to turn it on far away from each other.\n\nOver all, this is a pretty good lower-mid-range convertable laptop with a terrible keyboard. If you care about the keyboard, don't get it, or any other laptop with a latticeless keyboard. If you don't care about the keyboard, wait for a sale in the $450-$550 range.",
  "Honestly, the only real downside I noticed with the HP Omnibook X is the display. It‚Äôs fine for day-to-day stuff, but it‚Äôs not super bright and kinda struggles outdoors. Also, no OLED option so if you care about deep blacks or really punchy colors, this might feel a bit underwhelming compared to other laptops in the same price range. For a machine that nails battery life and performance, the screen feels like the one corner they cut. IDK why! these snapdragon powered devices doesn't work well!",
  "The colors are terrible. The red is orange. I put my color tuned display next to this laptop and the red is totally ORANGE. It's not even close to red.\n\nThe green is a little yellowy and the blue is kind of cyan.\n\nIt works for work but I wouldn't want to use this thing for personal stuff like pictures and watching videos.",

  "is this a good laptop for a long run as a college student? (lenovo thinkbook 14 gen 7 amd) [Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Generation 7 AMD](https://preview.redd.it/y2c7ilafgvld1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff5702bd12b7900b40c57648e99aed99c13053b)\n\nI'm planning to purchase a new laptop and found this laptop that interest me. The laptop specs that I have customized and choose are as follows:\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ 7 7735HS (8 Cores 16 Threads)\n* GPU: AMD Radeon‚Ñ¢ 680M\n* RAM: 8GB upgradeable until 64GB @ DDR5-4800\n* Storage: 512GB\n* Ports:\n   * SD card reader\n   * USB-A (USB 5Gbps)\n   * Ethernet (RJ-45)\n   * Kensington¬Æ Nano Security Slot‚Ñ¢\n   * USB-C¬Æ (USB 10Gbps), with USB PD 3.0 & DP 1.4\n   * USB-A (USB 5Gbps), Always On\n   * HDMI¬Æ\n   * USB-C¬Æ (USB4¬Æ 40Gbps), with USB PD 3.0 & DP 1.4\n   * Headphone / microphone combo jack (3.5mm)\n\nI'm planning to use this laptop for my computer science studies and continue using it afterward at my workplace as a software/network engineer. The variety of I/O ports make it suitable for long-term use, imo. And from what I heard AMD tends to use less power and less heat which makes the battery life longer compared to Intel cause I need a better battery life for long classes while maintaining a decent amount of power. I also plan to play some light games on it, definitely not AAA titles. Some of the games I have in mind are Cuphead, Cult of the Lamb, Astroneer, No Man's Sky, and Fortnite.\n\nFor some reason, I haven't found many reviews on YouTube about this laptop, which is kind of odd. So, for those who already own it or have experience with it, in your opinion, is this a good laptop for college and work?",
  "My Review of the ASUS VivoBook Flip 14 ( TM420IA-DB71T) Sorry for the Format as I don't really post, but I feel like I have something to contribute as this laptop is still relatively new and not that easy to find. Also to clarify I chose the laptop with the ryzen 7 4700u  for $699 but there is a 4500u variant for a $100 less. But anyways here are the main specs: \n\n*  Operating System:  \nWindows 10 Home\n* Screen Size:  \n14\" FHD (1920 x 1080, glossy)\n* CPU  \nAMD Ryzen 7 4700U 2GHz (Turbo up to 4.1GHz)\n* RAM  \n8GB DDR4\n* Storage  \n512GB PCIe SSD\n* Bluetooth  \nBluetooth 4.2 (Dual band) 2\\*2\n* Keyboard  \nBacklit Chiclet Keyboard\n* WebCam  \n720p HD camera\n* Battery  \n42WHrs, 3S1P, 3-cell Li-ion\n* Dimensions  \n12.8\" x 8.7\" x 0.7\"\n* Weight  \n3.3 lbs\n* Accessories  \nStylus\n\nFirst things first, although the price may feel tempting, this laptop has plenty of issues that I find it hard to recommend. On the flip side, I will start with the aspects that I did enjoy.\n\n1. The display, i will admit that this display can be a lot better and the people who like to dismiss this laptop because of the 250 nits brightness and  45% NTSC screen are justified to do so in my opinion since those aren't numbers to brag about at all. But this display has pleasantly surprised me. Unless I'm trying to conserve battery or am outside, this screen is plenty bright and has nice viewing angles. \n2. Tablet mode, the hinge is not the best and at the bottom of the 360 turns feels a bit loose, but I am genuinely enjoying using this 2 in 1. Like I mentioned earlier this display isn't good enough for me to color with (I have a color accurate monitor for that), but the pen that comes with the laptop is pretty great and doing artwork on it is a breeze. It's really easy to switch between apps and with the laptops light weight, it doesn't feel like I'm lugging a whole ass laptop. I have even used tablet mode to just watch my shows up close and it honestly looked great.\n3. The CPU and RAM, I know those are two separate components in the pc but I'll combine them here since they're both the main drivers of performance in this pc. The ryzen 4000 series is great and it handles everything I throw at it. It reminds me of the ryzen 7 3700x in my gaming pc. The radeon graphics also impressed me and for once I can kind of agree with their line that it can \"casually game\". The RAM although starting at a disappointing 8GB at 3200MHZ, is something that you can upgrade! Which is something you don't see in very many laptops these days. There's only one SODIMM (at least from what I've heard, I will be replacing one of the RAM slots in a few days so I may update this post) for you to upgrade to, so it wont run in dual channel if you do decide to expand the memory.\n\nAnd now to move on to the things which I didn't enjoy which will probably be longer than the last.\n\n1. I thought it looked alright in picture but in person the chassis feels and looks cheaper than other laptops that are hundreds of dollars less than this laptop. I'm sure its fine for a lot of people but it is something to keep in mind and be ready for your fingerprint to leave marks everywhere. \n2. Bloatware, not that this is as big of an issue because microsoft does it a lot too, but installing over a gb of mcafee antivirus, really asus? \n3. The battery has to be one of the most disappointing things on this laptop. The only way to make it last as long as its competitors is to turn the already dim display all the way down, turn on battery saver, and use one app at a time. If you're trying to multitask with the brightness up, good luck getting more than 4-5 hours on a full charge. \n4. The Keyboard, again this isn't as big of an issue but I'm not a fan of these keys. There was a decent adjustment period getting used to these keys and I think its noteworthy to bring it up. I can play tetris at a pretty high level on most devices but this one took an especially long time to get used to, it could just be a me issue tho. \n5. I may have just been unlucky but I also ran into not one but **two** issues within the first two weeks of using the vivobook.  First the fingerprint scanner stopped working after a windows update and I have yet to fix the issue (actually anyone who wants to dm and try to help I'll appreciate it greatly). And secondly, possibly a bigger issue if the problem persists, but sometimes I cannot turn on the pc without plugging in the power adapter even if there's a decent amount of battery life left.  Now it hasn't happened in the last couple days, but the fact that I had to deal with issues like this with a brand new laptop is kinda infuriating considering the amount of money I spent on it.\n\nI still plan on keeping this laptop as the cpu, ability to upgrade ram, and drawing tablet functionality will help me a lot with what I need my computer for. However the fact still stands that I have a very hard time recommending this laptop and I think you're better off trying to find a lenovo alternative or shelling out more money for a proper 2 in 1.\n\n\n\nEdit: So I finally upgraded the ram and replaced one of the 4gb sticks with 16gb making the new total ram 20gb running at 3200mhz. There really is only one sodimm slot but  it really is fine for me. A couple of other things to mention are when I opened the laptop there were fingerprints on the back panel that were there from presumably assembly. And unlike a lot of laptops I saw on YouTube, underneath the cage that houses the ssd and ram, there‚Äôs a thick piece of tape on the ram, so be prepared to remove that. \n\nOnly other things I can think to mention in my review is that now that I‚Äôve listened to some music on it without my headphones , the speakers  aren‚Äôt half bad :)",
  "I've been following the TM420IA as it has been slowly rolled out across the globe. There are so many different versions out there and some countries aren't getting access to the better ones.\n\nAs far as I can see, so far Germany and Indonesia have Wifi6 + 16GB + 100% sRGB versions.\n\nNo sign of a 1TB SSD version yet, which the ASUS website says should exist...",
  "Thanks for the review! The version in my country lists 50wH battery so hopefully it fares better in battery life. The only other 'cheaper' 2in1 with Renoir we have here is Lenovo Flex 5 with 220 nit TN so that's a hard no. \n\nJust one correction:\n\n>  so it wont run in dual channel if you do decide to expand the memory.\n\nIt'll run in a hybrid mode, e.g. 4GB soldered + 8GB SO-DIMM = 4GB+4GB dual channel and leftover 4GB at single channel, so IGPU and programs can still benefit. Intel calls this flex mode but AMD doesn't have a fancy name for it.",

  "Thank you for your review! It helped a lot when deciding on the purchase.  I actually got the Ryzen 5 model hoping the battery would last a bit longer than what you reported.  It does run a bit longer but only by 30 min lol.  Still a great purchase, I do like how it looks except for it being a fingerprint magnet as you described.  I don't have issues with the fingerprint sensor, though it does have trouble recognizing my fingerprint from time to time on the first time.  Did you by any chance tried to install the graphics drivers directly from AMD?  I did as I thought I would get more performance but I saw all sorts of weird things happening, like sometimes when waking up the laptop from sleep the screen would change resolution, or when disconnecting a USB drive the screen would go black and I would need to reset the laptop, etc.  Also the pen activity was affected where there would be several times when the pen would not be recognized. Plus, Windows would try constantly to install it's own drivers through windows update which would exacerbate these issues and make them a lot more frequent, so I ended up giving up on the AMD drivers and uninstalling them from the laptop and rely only on what Windows was installing from Windows update.  Now the issues are gone, so I wonder if you installed this and somehow it's messing up with your fingerprint reader?  By the way I found the reason why the screen is quite good despite not being very bright.  I looked at the display manufacturer model number and found that it's a BOE panel.  Looking for information online I found the contrast to be around 1250:1.  As a comparison, most 5000 series Dell laptops only have 600:1 in contrast and several even have 400:1.  Even some of their 7000 series laptops have a 600:1 ratio.  So even if the screen is not 300 nits the good contrast makes it easier to read.",

  "Using one for a year and the one in the title for half a year, pretty good build quality, decent enough preice to performance and good tech support, feels like I've stumbled on a hidden gem so far",
  "yea I've heard abt it, like the change from x to arm software or sth like that? But does it also mean that in the future the Snapdragon ones would be a better option than the Intel ones or no difference between them?",
  "Intel and AMD use the x86 architecture, which is outdated compared to Snapdragon, which uses ARM. ARM is, by design, a generational upgrade‚Äîit was meant to be efficient and powerful, and it has finally reached a point where it can match desktop computers in performance. The problem is that Microsoft has a terrible ecosystem; even their own Windows apps are often several versions behind on their latest OS when compared to Apple, which maintains tight control over its ecosystem and has a much better software update lifecycles. \n\nTechnically, ARM is the future, but if I were to buy a Windows laptop today, I would prefer AMD first, then Intel, and lastly Snapdragon, because it‚Äôs risky to invest in a product being sold on promises. If ARM on Windows improves significantly over the next few years, I‚Äôd consider reselling the laptop and buying a new one‚Äîbut personally, I don‚Äôt like betting on promises.  \n\nThat said, it all depends on your workflow. When I first bought the Apple M1, I knew it would feel like being a beta tester‚Äîconstantly finding workarounds and dealing with issues. But I also knew it wasn‚Äôt my only work device; I had a desktop and an older laptop I could use if something didn‚Äôt work. So it was a manageable risk‚Äîthink about it that way. Similarly, I bought an Android tablet a decade ago, back when they weren‚Äôt really mainstream, but only for entertainment and experimentation. If you need a device for important work and there are no easy workarounds, it‚Äôs probably not worth it yet.",
  "What a good answer that is sir. Well said everything and completely agrees with you.",
  "thank youü´°",
  "I deliberately bought an ARM laptop to 'beta test' the architecture.\n\nAs long as you aren't running software on it, like anything from adobe or most games, then it's completely usable.

  "HP Elitebook Ultra G1i Full Review Hey r/laptops,\n\nFirst full review here. I'm a recent convert (or attempted convert) from the world of macOS. For context, I've been daily driving a 2018 15\" Intel MacBook Pro for the past six years and reasons I won‚Äôt bore you with, I decided it was time to jump back into the Windows world.\n\nMy initial plan was to wait for reviews of a few more Intel Lunar Lake laptops before making a move. But, as fate would have it, my trusty MacBook met an untimely demise (coffee, laptops, and kids don't mix), so I was forced to upgrade immediately. \n\n**My needs**:\n\nComing from a MacBook, battery life was super important. I wasn't expecting miracles, but I needed something that could realistically get me through a transatlantic flight or a full day of cafe work on a single charge. My workload is heavily productivity-focused: emails, Google Docs, PDFs, Office suite (Word, PowerPoint), Slack, Teams, web browsing, and the usual social media (primarily Facebook/Messenger). I also do light Python coding in VS Code occasionally.\n\nMy first attempt was the Asus Zenbook S14. On paper, it looked promising, but two things killed it for me. First, the non-haptic trackpad was a bigger hurdle than I anticipated. After years with one, it felt like a significant downgrade in daily usability to go to a precision trackpad. Second, and more critically, it flat-out refused to work with my external USB-C display (Dell U3219Q). This was a dealbreaker for me, so it went back to BestBuy. \n\nAfter the Zenbook, I was now specifically looking for a 14\" laptop with a haptic trackpad, Intel Lunar Lake (mainly for optimized battery life and compatibility), and premium build quality. Price wasn‚Äôt really an object. I just wanted the right machine.\n\nDell  XPS was out due to the function row layout (no physical keys. The one thing I hated about my Macbook Pro). I briefly considered Surface Laptops, even without Lunar Lake, but the lack of USB-C charging ports on both sides felt like a bizarre step back after years of convenience. It's a small thing, but these little annoyances add up.\n\nI ended up zeroing in on the new HP EliteBook lineup. Specifically, the EliteBook Ultra G1i and the EliteBook X G1i. Initially, the X G1i was more appealing due to the built-in HDMI port (less dongle life) and the lack of an expandable USB-A port like the Ultra (less potential for mechanical failure down the line). However, the X G1i had three dealbreakers: no haptic trackpad (again!), no OLED display (the LCD isn't bezel-less), and the baffling placement of the Page Up/Page Down keys above the side arrow keys ‚Äì a recipe for accidental key presses.\n\nSo, I bit the bullet and went for the HP EliteBook Ultra G1i. I opted for the configuration with 32GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, with a plan to upgrade the storage later (it uses a standard 2280 NVMe drive).\n\n**HP EliteBook Ultra G1i ‚Äì The Review:**\n\n**Build Quality:**\n\nGenerally excellent. Very close to my Macbook. The chassis feels solid and premium. My only real gripe here is display wobble!! The hinge itself is tight and holds the screen at any angle, but the display panel itself is surprisingly wobbly. Even when stationary, it seems overly sensitive to vibrations and movement. It‚Äôs not the end of the world, but it‚Äôs definitely noticeable and less refined than I expected. See video below where I have it next to my work laptop which is a 14\" Macbook pro. I tap the table a bit with my leg and the wobble is pretty noticeable.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1izv3v7/video/peee1onmxrle1/player\n\nI also noticed a minor annoyance with the up arrow key. It feels mushy compared to the rest of the keyboard, which is a bit jarring in an otherwise premium experience.\n\n**Keyboard:**\n\nApart from the one mushy key, the keyboard overall is a strong point. Coming from a MacBook, the keys require a bit more actuation force, but they are satisfyingly clicky and tactile. I was able to get up to my usual touch-typing speed quickly. Key travel is good, and overall, no complaints about the typing experience itself. My only minor quibble is the font choice on the keycaps. It‚Äôs fine, but I think a slightly different font or a smaller text size on the keys would look nicer. Purely subjective, though.\n\n  \n**Haptic Trackpad:**\n\nThis was a major selling point for me, and thankfully, the haptic trackpad is good. It replicates the feel of a physical click pretty well. However, I did notice a couple of quirks. There seems to be a subtle difference in pressure sensitivity ‚Äì it feels like it requires slightly more pressure to click towards the top of the trackpad compared to the bottom.\n\nMore noticeably, I found that palm rejection isn't perfect. If the palm of my other hand rests slightly on the trackpad, clicks can sometimes fail to register. Also, and this might be a Windows thing (coming from macOS), you can't two-finger scroll and click simultaneously. On macOS, I'm used to being able to two-finger scroll and then click without lifting my fingers. On the EliteBook, you have to lift your fingers from the trackpad before clicking for the click to register. It took me a while to realize this was happening and why some clicks were being missed.\n\n**Display:**\n\nThe OLED display is gorgeous. Colors are vibrant (if not a bit too vibrant at times), blacks are inky deep, and everything just pops. However, and it's a significant \"however,\" it is **incredibly reflective.** It‚Äôs like working in front of a mirror in bright environments. While the display is sharp and detailed, it's not bright enough to effectively combat the glare in well-lit spaces. In my typical dimly lit workspace, it‚Äôs fine, but in brighter conditions, the glare becomes a real problem, more so than I experienced with my MacBook Pro‚Äôs display.\n\n**Camera:**\n\nWecam is fine, although my skin tone is really off and colors are over-saturated. This isn't just an OLED display issue. When I'm on a meeting, other people look fine, while I look either jaundiced or red as a tomato. The Poly Camera Pro software that comes installed weirdly doesn't allow me to adjust the white balance. This issue aside, the resolution and quality itself is great. It's just the colors are a bit weird.  \n\n**Performance:**\n\nPerformance-wise, the EliteBook Ultra G1i is snappy and responsive for my productivity workload. As I mentioned, I'm mostly doing a bunch of productivity work, some light coding, and general web browsing. It handles everything I throw at it without breaking a sweat, and stays very quiet. Apart from initial setup, I basically never heard the fans. For my use case, performance is more than adequate.\n\n**Battery Life: The Unforgivable Sin**\n\nAnd now we come to the absolute dealbreaker: battery life. It is, in a word, abysmal. I‚Äôm consistently getting only 4-5 hours of real-world use, maybe 6!! And this is regardless of what I'm doing. Whether I'm just browsing the web in Edge, working in Google Docs, or doing anything else, the battery life hovers around the 5 hour mark. I have yet to break the 8-hour barrier, let alone reach the double-digit figures I was hoping for.\n\nI consider myself fairly tech-savvy, and I‚Äôve gone through all the usual stuff: checking startup apps, monitoring process usage, disabling unnecessary browser extensions, tweaking power settings ‚Äì all to no avail. I can only conclude that HP hasn't properly optimized battery management on this laptop yet, or the hardware is simply power-hungry.\n\nFor a modern ultraportable in this price range, and especially one marketed towards business professionals, this battery life is simply unacceptable. It completely defeats the purpose of portability and long work sessions away from a power outlet. My old 2018 MacBook Pro, even with its old battery, often lasted longer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a tough one. The HP EliteBook Ultra G1i has a lot going for it. The build quality is generally excellent, the keyboard and trackpad are good (albeit with some quirks), and the OLED display is stunning (if overly reflective). Performance is more than sufficient for productivity tasks. However, the catastrophic battery life completely overshadows all its positives. For a laptop that is supposed to be a premium, ultraportable business machine, lasting only 4-5 hours on a charge is simply not good enough. It fails in its fundamental purpose as a portable device in 2025.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I've decided to return the HP EliteBook Ultra G1i. It‚Äôs a shame, as I wanted to love this laptop. But battery life is a non-negotiable for me, especially at this price point (I dropped $2,300 USD on this). I‚Äôll be going back to using my work laptop while I do more research and wait for more Lunar Lake (and maybe AMD Strix Point?) options to become available and reviewed.\n\nHappy to answer any questions you have about my experience with the EliteBook Ultra G1i. Hopefully, this review will help others in their laptop search!",
  "I've been daily driving a Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition 15.3\" Lunar Lake 258V 32GB 4TB SSD (upgraded) for a while. Similar productivity focused use. Easily getting 10+ hours out of it. Sometimes I don't charge it for two days or so if I don't do video calls. Excellent build quality, keyboard, and display. No haptic touchpad though, but I have never used one and am comfortable with this.",
  "Thanks for the helpful review. My choice came down to this one and the Lenovo Thinkapd X9.\n\nHave you checked out the new Lenovo Thinkpad X9 14\" ? Antiglare OLED (30-120 Hz VRR); Haptic touch, Lunar Lake, Thin and light, strong build quality but \"only\" 55 Wh battery. However, this should last at least 10hours. Check out Andrew's Review Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRuzefBwUVQ&t=324s&ab\\_channel=AndrewMarcDavid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRuzefBwUVQ&t=324s&ab_channel=AndrewMarcDavid)\n\nWhat you can also consider is maybe Snapdragon X Elite Laptops, Even more efficent than Intel / AMD and with better performance. I am currently typing on a Lenovo Slim 7x. Overall its great but I will probably switch to X9 because there some (minor) X86 apps I need (plus I prefer an antiglare screen).\n\nEDIT: I just ordered the X9",
  "How big is the battery? 5 to 6 hours is achievable on my old ZBook workstations and they're not exactly designed around efficiency.",
  "Do you remember what power (Windows) / performance profile (myHP) you were using? I'm on a much older Elitebook (G8 generation with \\~50Wh) and I still get \\~5 hours of light browser use on the original battery + 80% charge cap.",
  "Intel Core Ultra 7 268v supports PCIE 5x4 ... Yet the drives that ship with the Elitebook Ultra G1i are specced at PCIE 4x4. I am wondering however if upgrading the drive to a Samsung PRO 9100 PCIE 5x4 drive would be possible, with the Elitebook supporting full PCIE 5.0 speeds? Could anyone provide any insight here?",
  "AFAIK, both the X G1i and G1a has OLED options.",
  "so has there been updates to improve the battery life?",
  "Great review. Quite a niche question, but do you know if it's possible to 'write' on the screen with a passive stylus? I only ask as the HP EliteBook 8 G1i is so much lighter than the Flip alternative. My needs are to annotate pdf's, but I'd rather lose the 'artistic' functionality of the FLIP and shave 200g lugging it around. Appreciate you'd also lose the active stylus accuracy etc, but for simple note taking (I'm thinking the equivalent of a fingertip writing)... could be just the job.",
  "Here's [my review](https://www.reddit.com/r/elitebook/comments/1meprmh/hp_elitebook_x_flip_g1i_review/). I had quite different experience. Battery life should be WAAAAAYYYY better than that. Did you have it in Performance Mode the whole time? That would make a massive difference.",
  "[therewasonceaman123](https://www.reddit.com/user/therewasonceaman123/) i had exactly the same experience with the elitebook ultra g1i. i really loved the portability, was very fast, screen was good, good resolution, fantastic haspic touchbad, good keyboard But at the end there were 2 things i could not really handle, it was the screen wooble and the screen door effect. The wooble was almost constantly when typing or just using it. But the major reason was the screen door effect. Yes i know it is not as bad as cheap Zenbbook but still there and noticeable for me.\n\nI am so glad that i have read this thread otherwise i wouldnt even have known that there was a surface laptop 7 with intel. I had the qualcomm intel but found it quite slow, as it was emulating most of my software. now i have the business intel ultra 7 and i just love it.",
  "I just got mine for work, that screen wable is annoying AF! Other than than good machine for work.",
  "It looks like a beautiful laptop. I considered it, and it's 14\" sibling and the 9i too (though that one has a weird extra column of keys and an under display webcam), but I can't live without the haptic trackpad. Glad you're enjoying it and getting great battery life!",
  "Thanks for the feedback. I did see the Thinkpad X9. Actually I would have bought it, but for some reason I don't like the engine hub design. I prefer an even thickness laptop. This looks really weird to me. But it looks like it might work for you. Let me know how you like it! \n\nI did consider snapdragon but like you I have a couple pieces of software that don't play well with them (I tried) so I decided I wanted to go lunar lake.",
  "It's a 64 WHr battery. Middle of the pack for what I've seen on Lunar Lake laptops.",
  "Your old Zbook Fury wouldn't have a 120hz OLED 2.8K touchscreen panel.  That is why the battery drain is so severe on the Elitebook Ultra.  Simply dropping the refresh rate to 60hz will net you a 30% battery life gain.  Take away touch screen and you get another 20-30% in battery life gain.  That alone will get you from a 5-6hr device to almost 10 hours alone.  But for any device right now with a 2.8K 120hz OLED touchscreen panel, the battery life is going to be abysmal unless you put a 90WHr battery in it.  Then the device will be much heavier and not as sleek.",
  "What's interesting is that the myHP app doesn't have any  power profiles itself and just kicks you back to windows, where I have it set to balanced. I'm really wondering if they're still ironing out the kinks in their software. It just doesn't make sense.",
  "Answering my own question ‚Ä¶ Yes the HP Elitebook Ultra 1Gi does support PCIE 5.0 drives ‚Ä¶ Crystal Diskmark just delivered a first benchmark with read speeds going up to 14071 MB/s on a Samsung PRO 9100 2tb üî•",
  "I don't know. Didn't keep it long enough to find out. I returned it shortly after posting the review.",
  "The keyboard and screen reflection is also dogshit, which i can't really tolerate",
  "The Lenovo Thinkpad x1 carbon gen 13 has a haptic track pad option. The haptic track pad is not available yet in the US but I believe some markets have already gotten the option.",
  "Have you considered the ThinkPad X9 14\"?",
  "So my initial thoughts, X9 itself is great but the amazing screen unfortunately has a screen door effect and it is hard to ignore it. My Slim 7x does not have the effect. The non-touch FHD OLED for X9 is far less appealing.\n\nThe \"enginge hub\" is not an issue at all, you barely notice it and you get used to it quickly.\n\nI am looking for alternatives:\n\nX1 Carbon Gen 13 (OLED Matte screen) with haptic or new Microsoft Laptop for Business, also haptic and great screen. (IPS, anti reflective).\n\nWhat do you think?",
  "That probably plays a role. My ZBook 17 G8 can do 5 - 6 hours running web tasks even with its full fat hardware purely due to its battery being big enough to compensate.\n\nBe interesting to see a lunar lake machine with a battery of equivalent size.",
  "I mean it does have the 4K dreamcolor panel, which on the G8 and newer is a 120hz unit - albeit an IPS panel, not OLED. It's also not a touch screen so that probably plays a part.",
  "Thanks, any idea how to reinstall windows on the new disk?",
  "Thanks for the feedback. I actually ended up getting the Microsoft Surface Laptop for Business. I love it. Build quality is even better than the HP Elitebook Ultra. I have two complaints that I've just learned to overlook. The first is a lack of USB-C ports on both sides of the laptop. An annoying issue I haven't had to think about in many years. The second is that when the laptop is plugged in, and under load, there's a tiny bit of coil whine coming from the charger port. Seems like an issue with the surface laptop as I found other posts where people are complaining about this on the snapdragon model. But as I said, I'll learn to live with both. I think this is the best we've got for the time being. I'm happy to answer questions about the laptop if you have any.",
  "Likely one of the 16inch?",
  "I just used the HP Cloud Recovery USB disk",
  "What is your experience / impression now?\n\nHow is the screen (reflection)?\n\nHave you considered the following?\n\n\\- X1 Carbon Gen 13 - ticks a lot of boxes, not sure if I like the \"corporate\" style\n\n\\- X1 2in1 Gen 10 --> Nice Aluminium version with touch but probably also has screen door effect\n\n\\- X9 with FHD+ OLED 400 nits 60Hz Screen, actually for a 14\" inch it might be alright.",
  "I'm happy with the Surface Laptop. I'm going to be keeping it. The screen is not as reflective as my old Macbook as is on par or slightly less reflective than my work MBP, but certainly not as matte as the newest generation of MacBooks. My only real complaint at the moment is the lack of a USB-C port on both sides of the laptop. \n\nI'm not a fan of the corporate style of the X1, and don't like the 2 in 1 form factor either. The X9 might work for you, but 400 nits is kinda low. The Surface Laptop is 600 nits, moderately anti-reflective, but it's not an OLED display. \n\nGood luck with your search!",
  "4 months later. Are you still happy with your purchase?\n\nI am currently trying to choose between the Surface Laptop 7, X1 Carbon, EliteBook Ultra g1i and EliteBook X g1a.\n\nAnd I was wondering, why didn't you originally consider the EliteBook X g1a with the much more powerful ryzen 9 hx 375 chip?  \nAlso, what windows resolutions scaling do you use?  \nDid you find a natural scaling spot where the text was larger or smaller than with the 2880x1800 panels vs the 2304x1536 found in the surface?  \nHas the coil while gotten better or worse, or do you simply not think about it anymore? Also does it only come from the surface connect charger or also when using usb-c charging?  \nHow is the battery life for demanding tasks?",
  "Yes, I'm happy with the surface laptop! It's not perfect, but I don't have any major regrets. \n\nI didn't consider the elitebook X g1a because it didn't have a haptic track pad and it has the split right/left arrow keys with the page up/down buttons which I despise. It's an abomination. \n\nI'm using 150% scaling at full resolution and that's perfect for me. No complaints there. \n\nThe coil whine is still present when plugged in, but I don't really notice it anymore most of the time as I'm usually very focused when I'm working or have headphones on. I'm also on battery most of the time. I think I noticed it for the first time in months just the other day. So not bad. \n\nI haven't actually ever used the surface connect charger. It's still wrapped up in the box. I carry a single USBC charger and cable with me for all my devices and don't feel like carrying another. It certainly would have been nice to have a USBc port on the right side of the laptop for this reason, and it's caused me an issue twice now, but I've learned to live with it. \n\nThe battery life is... Okay. I really don't know how reviewers are getting the insane battery life they're reporting. For my Macbook which I had used in an identical manner I was getting 50% or so more battery life out of it. That's really the only thing that's making me miss Apple. For my overall work style, their battery life is just superior!",
  "Thanks for the answers! One final question for you. Do you notice any screen door effect due to the touchscreen even though it's IPS and not OLED?",
  "You're welcome! Nope I don't see any screendoor effect. The display is great! I wish it were brighter, but that's it. Good luck with your decision!",
  "I had exactly the same. i had the elitebook ultra g1i and i loved it expect two things made me return it. 1. was the screen door effect which was notable to me althought high resolution. it was not real bad like on cheap zenbook but still there and it botherd me when browsing, read news, on hight brightness. 2. the screen wooble was bad too, sit on sofa, touch the screen wooble, type wooble. the rest i really loved, portable, fast, oled. now i also have the surface laptop 7 and i love it. i wish is was ratio 16:10 instead 3:2 but i can live with it.\n\nthe screen door effect comes onyl with oled displays, and it depends on ppi, the higher and the higher the resolution the better it should be. The worst ive seen so far are on Asus Zenbooks. IPS display never have a metal mesh. Surface Laptop has PixelSense which also not has a mesh.",

So im looking for laptop for only studying/ working and my girlie staff like binging netflix series at night... so it doesnt need to be super powerfull but it should be compact. I would love a device that would last me for years. I narrowed it down to these 2 options which seems to suit my needs best:\n\n1. Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Ryzen 5 7535HS/32GB/512+1TB/Win11P \n\n2. ASUS ZenBook 14 UM3406KA Ryzen AI 7 350/16GB/1TB/W11P OLED 120Hz.\n\nThey both seem to be nice and well enough for my needs as im not gaming on laptop (rather use Playstation). The price diffrence between them is not as important to me as choosing one that would be a more solid option and would last at least 5 years :3. The main diffrence between them seems to be the processor: ryzen 5 7535HS (lenovo) vs ryzen AI 7 (ASUS). Also the ASUS has OLED and I can see it is well reviewed but I'm not sure I need it as much as I am not a laptop-playing kind of girl. Also I read that there may by some technical problems with OLED such as burning in and I really cant afford service :p and thats why I am looking for something reliable and for years. \n\nI would love and appreciate any piece of advice <3 Thanksssss",
  "I would go for Asus Zenbook. It has more powerful CPU as well as OLED display - these displays usually have higher brightness and wider color gamut.",
  "I really don‚Äôt like my Zenbook, I would recommend a 100-200‚Ç¨ eBay lenovo or the like and a pack of cute stickers to put on it, it‚Äôs cheaper, the keyboards feel better, and they‚Äôre very unlikely to break or have issues. Modern luxury laptops are usually unrepairable, unreasonably expensive, and have bad performance compared to super loud and hot gaming laptops of the same price.

  "Great job! üëç\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! üòÑ )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",

  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! üôÇ",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! üôÇ\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! üôÇ",

  "NEVER buy asus laptops they are masters in pc motherboards but recently asus is horrible in laptops and their drivers and everything. for you or generally speaking Lenovo should always be your first option because it is with no doubt the best preformance per value in the market or you could also get a HP which are great but i favor Lenovo. and the ideapad slim 5 is THE BEST option, it has the best build quality and also does not break the bank.",
  "Hard time choosing a new laptop. So I currently am using a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, and am planning on upgrading because: A) It is not powerful enough, and B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nI am a student and will primarily be using the laptop for school work, so it needs to be portable and a comfortable weight to bring with me to and from class. I love how portable my 13\" Air is. I've done a LOT of research over the past two years, but never bit the bullet, but I feel like now is the time, and so I've committed to buying one now.\n\nMy use cases (in order of importance): School, Music Production, Photoshop, Gaming\n\nI don't play a lot of games but it would be nice to have a machine to play some Civ 6 or even some other, more intensive games like BO2/BO3 Zombies (and MAYBEEEE some RDR2) when I am on a plane for a long time. I want something that's decent on battery life, I don't spend all day at school, maybe 4 hours at most on a given day, so I want something that'll last me that long doing just school work without having to even worry about bringing a charger.\n\nNow, I've looked at like tens of laptops, from gaming to notebook, and I've seen some I've considered like the Zenbook S16, Lenovo Slim 7i Aura, Zenbook 14, Zenbook A14, but I've narrowed it down to a couple:\n\nZephyrus G14/G16 - The clear winner for me, problem is it is just too expensive, and the only models that go on sale into my price range are the 4050 G14 and 4060 G16 models which I've heard may not be worth it. They don't go on sale super often, and the ones that do are open box. (Currently can get the 4050 model for $1499 CAD open box)\n\nZenbook Duo 2024 (Ultra 9, 32GB, 1TB, 60hz 1080p model) - I've toyed with the idea of having this laptop for a while. My PC setup at home has 3 monitors and I absolutely love it, and could see myself getting genuine use out of both screens when writing an assignment, key word being WHEN I am doing an assignment, which isn't an every day thing. I don't think it would be powerful enough to handle any gaming at all. Surprisingly, this is actually cheaper than both the G14 and G16 Models I would be getting. (Currently can get it Refurb-Excellent for $1519 CAD)\n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 15\" - This just came out, and I feel like 15\" is the perfect size for me to be honest. I can get the spec with the Ryzen 7 260, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD (will add another in the future), and a 5060 8GB card for within my price range, around $1750 all in. It's around 4 pounds which is the heaviest of the three, but is also the fastest of the three. It's so new that there isn't a single review yet for it. (Brand new for $1750 CAD, could try and haggle it at Lenovo)\n\nThese are my three ideas right now in terms of what to get. Does anyone have any recommendations? Anyone with these laptops have advice?\n\nI'd not like to spend more than $2000 CAD.\n\nEDIT: In case it wasn't clear, this is not meant to be a desktop replacement; I already have one.",
  "Well you need to be aware of the fact that most gaming laptops have a dedicated gpu they are loud heavy and the battery life is 3hours at best and the performance is ass when on battery .\nSo you‚Äôll want something with a powerful igpu like a Ryzen ai 300 series (the Ryzen 7 or 9 models) or the intel core ultra 200 series ( like the ultra 7 258v) these have the most powerful iGPUs currently available. Also their batter life is pretty good.",
  "Don't buy the Zenbook duo. It's more of a gimmick and not a good choice for your use case. \n\nGaming laptops all suffer from battery life. They always need to be plugged in. They don't last long. \n\nYou might want to get something with a modern AMD Ryzen 8000 series CPU. The integrated graphics are good for some light gaming. These CPU are also power efficient so you get good battery life.\n\nAsus Zenbook S16 and Zenbook 14 should be the models to consider. The models with AMD Ryzen CPUs.",
  ">B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nGood luck.",
  "Thanks!",

  "First impression of the ASUS ZenBook S 14 258V (Lunar Lake) I received my S 14 about 24 hours ago and have been testing various features. While this isn't a comprehensive review, I hope it might be helpful to some.\n\n* **Processor:** Intel Core Ultra 7 258V 4 x 2.2 - 4.8 GHz, 37 W PL2 / Short Burst, 17 W PL1 / Sustained, Lunar Lake\n* **Graphics adapter**: Intel Arc Graphics 140V\n* **Memory**: 32 GB, LPDDR5x-8533, Dual-Channel\n* **Display**: 14 inches 16:10, 2880 x 1800 pixel 243 PPI, ATNA40CU09-0, OLED, glossy, HDR, 120 Hz\n* **Weight**: 1.179 kg\n\nThe build quality is impressive. The device looks sleek, super thin, and relatively light.\n\nThe display is excellent, though as someone who's seen and owned many OLEDs, I wish it were matte like the new Tab S10. Nonetheless, it's a really good screen. The touchscreen is a nice addition, but in my opinion, it would be better if the display could be laid flat. Everything runs smoothly at 120Hz, and it supports VRR.\n\nThe trackpad is one of the best mechanical ones I've used. While it doesn't compare to haptic trackpads, it's still very good.\n\nThe speakers are surprisingly good for a laptop this size. They caught me off guard with their quality.\n\nThe keyboard is decent, though I wish the keys had more travel. That's what happens when you've tried a ThinkPad keyboard ‚Äì everything else falls short.\n\nI didn't buy it for gaming, but I tested Fortnite, and it played well. I also experimented with XeSS, which provided a good experience. But I'm not really a gamer, I play light games like Vampire Survivors, AoEIIHD, Mini Motorways, etc.\n\nOverall performance is okay, but not as snappy as Snapdragon-powered laptops. The multicore performance, in my opinion, is almost ridiculously low. Compared to an iPad M4, X Elite / X Plus, or M3 MacBook, it feels like it's lacking some power. This is hard to describe, and I'm used to high-end devices (my workstation has a 7950x, I have an M3 MBP from work, I've had a P14s with an 8840hs, etc), so maybe I'm just too demanding. However, my overall feeling is that it can easily become sluggish.\n\nIt's also quite loud, which is my biggest disappointment. I thought it'd be silent for web browsing and such. While typing this with only Obsidian and Edge open, the fan is spinning. The CPU temperature is around 45-50¬∞C, drawing about 5W. I'm on \"Best Performance\" mode since the laptop is plugged in, but for less than 5W of CPU power, the fan activity seems excessive. Perhaps the chassis isn't great at dissipating heat. It's annoying, especially when any ARM device would be completely silent under these conditions.\n\nThe laptop wakes up almost instantly from sleep, but not quite as fast as ARM devices. Battery life seems better than typical Intel laptops, likely due to Intel's architecture optimization and fewer cores (and low performance). However, based on my brief testing, I don't think it'll match the battery life of X Elite / X Plus devices (SP11, Slim 7x, PZ13). The battery drained about 4% in 10.5 hours, which seems high compared to my PZ13, which only drained 1% in the same period.\n\nMy conclusion: If you need to use an x86-only app that doesn't emulate well, play games that don't run on ARM, want good battery life without needing much power, or don't believe in ARM's future in the PC world, this might work for you. The device is great. Lunar Lake is... a mixed experience. Otherwise, I'd recommend sticking with ARM. I think x86 in thin and light devices may be approaching its end.",
  "I thought battery life on lunar lake vs arm chips were relatively the same? And if not better than the snapdragon chips?",
  "One month update: \n\nThis is the best x86 portable device I've owned by far. It is mostly quiet when on Balanced or Power Saving. I was initially worried about the noise, but I guess \"Best performance mode\" was overkill anyway to browser the web, so my bad :) Again, not as snappy as ARM, but as good as it gets with x86 for a thin & light laptop. Battery life has been nothing short of amazing for my casual use. The overall package is really good on this device. Only con is that it's pretty expensive, but at least it comes with 32GB/1TB, not 16GB/512GB like the M4 MBP at the same price (but M4 should perform much MUCH better, and last much longer, but no OLED, no touchscreen, no upgradable storage, no WiFi7, etc).",
  "Want to buy a zenbook 15, doesnt asus have a setting that you can make the fan run slower ? doesnt that help with fan sound?",
  "Thanks for your review! I've been holding out as long as possible to replace my 2016 windows laptop. Wanted to see how lunar lake did in comparison to snapdragon. Kind of disappointed to hear that that its noticeably less powerful. I talked to a guy at microcenter who said they were getting a lot of returns on the ARM laptops because of the incompatibility.",
  "thanks for the review!   \namazed to understand it feels less snappy than the ARM variants.   \nalso i understand there is a serious performance drop while on battery?\n\ni think they should have put this weak cpu in extreme ultra portables like the surface or very thin and light devices. seems its not a buff enough for more than that?",
  "Hi OP, how about the wireless (wifi and BT) connections reliability ? \n\nI mean, i read that some user of ryzen ai based zenbook have issues with wireless connections reliability (probably because of mediatec chip ?).\n\nI'm still considering to get zenbook lunar lake or ryzen ai, still researching now",
  "So how is the screen outdoors ive heard people call it a black mirror is that true?",
  "could you let me know if this laptop charges above 65 watts? the charger it comes with is 65 but i‚Äôm curious if more works.",
  "Snapdragons are snappy until they aren‚Äôt compatible with native programs, then snapdragon becomes slow, clunky, and frozen. There are simply too many things still using non native arm for a snapdragon to truely replace a traditional laptop. At least for me. It makes me sad üò¢",
  "When you talk about snappiness do you mean ARM is generally better than x86 or just better than 258v? Also which ARM CPUs are we talking in comparison to? Apple or Snapdragon chips?",
  "Thanks for the update. Thinking of getting one - does it get warm (at the bottom of the chassis) when on Balanced/Whisper mode? And how is the battery life comparing to the M3 MBP (I have the M1 MBP, hence the question)",
  "Yeah, that's right, there's a whisper mode. Right now I'm unplugged, the whole thing is draining \\~4w-5w, the CPU drains 1w-2w, CPU temp is 38. That's pretty good for sure, but it's also even more limited in performance in this mode. For $2500 CAD, that's a lot to ask for such limited performance.",
  "I'm also looking to upgrade (from a 2011 Gateway laptop), and as of right now it seems like Macbooks are the way to go if you don't care about Windows or gaming, Lunar Lake for thin and light general use (still waiting for more devices), and AMD for heavier use.\n\nThe reality is that Windows on ARM is just not 100% there yet. If it runs the software you need, it works great. But if it doesn't, it's basically useless. That's why you get OP singing praises about Snapdragon laptops and how x86 is dying, and the Microcenter guy saying people are returning them.\n\nAs an example, Snapdragon laptops can't even run Ableton Live in emulation mode, so it's a no-go for me. I really don't want to bother looking up the compatibility for all my software (and even if it runs in emulation, there's going to be a performance or battery penalty).",
  "No performance drop on battery AFAIK",
  "Zero issue with Wifi and BT",
  "It's glossy but it's as good or as bad as any other laptop IMO ü§∑üèª",
  "65 max. The battery isn't that big tbh and 65 is more than enough for quick top-ups",
  ">When you talk about snappiness do you mean ARM is generally better than x86 or just better than 258v?\n\nThat X Plus / X Elite are snappier than X86. 258V is close, but ARM is still snappier. It adds up after hours of small really quick interactions.\n\n>Also which ARM CPUs are we talking in comparison to? Apple or Snapdragon chips?\n\nSpecifically, Snapdragon since we're talking PCs. But ARM in generally snappier since the instructions are less complex (thus require less time to execute).",
  "we're you able to get one with an English keyboard?",
  "üíØ\n\nWindows on ARM is great until your good patience is reached, eg: I can't print double sided on my brother printer, why? No drivers for ASIO, and I know focusrite will take forever to release their, if they ever do. It piles up really quickly, and these devices aren't cheap. So it's a matter of what you're willing to compromise the most... battery life? performances? compatibility? price?\n\nBattery life: ARM or Intel\nPerformances: AMD or ARM\nCompatibility: AMD or Intel\nPrice: previous gen AMD/Intel\n\nLunar Lake is a good balance, but it still lacks what ARM offers on battery life, perf per watt and features like instant wake up/no battery drain on sleep. But it runs everything, just a bit slower at time.\n\nIt's not easy üòÖ\n\nAnd then you have MacBooks that just do it all. üôÉ Okay except gaming but I personally don't care about it so",
  "I am also planning to replace my current laptop but currently holding it out as long as the current one works because I am confused whether to go with arm, lunar lake or macbook air. \n\nHopefully within next one year, it will be clear, but I am more and more leaning towards MBA",
  "Thanks...now i'm choosing between asus or lenovo",
  "I would really appreciate if you could send me afew pics showcasing the glare on the screen üôè",
  "Any issues with outside use? Is it completely unusable or just worst?",
  "Thanks for the info. Looks like Lunar chips are good if you want to go with compatibility and somewhat improvement on power efficiency but not as optimized as snapdragon chips with that gives more snappy experience. AMD strix on the other hand consume more power and would probably need a big chassis to keep things cool.",
  "Yes only the labels are bilingual [https://i.imgur.com/vKb4n3B.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/vKb4n3B.jpeg)",
  "Purchased yoga x elite three weeks ago. I opted for snapdragon over macbook bc better repair-ability. I see a lot of people over-look this point when they compare windows vs apple. Screen replacement on windows costs \\~120USD and is possible to DIY. whereas screen replacement of a macbook air 15'' screen costs around \\~$600USD and can only be replaced by apple first party shop and takes days.",
  "Hello mate. Do you use this laptop for music production ? Runs smoothly ? Thx a lot",
  "I think it's a good idea to wait if possible because the M4 MBA should be coming early 2025, and more Lunar Lake laptops should be coming as well. But if you don't need Windows for specific software or games, then I would honestly just go MBA",
  "yes, even though I have been a windows user all through my life but plan to shift on mac because of the build quality and the long battery life it provides, I may take M2 MBA as now 16gb has become minimum and after the release of M4 MBA, the prices of M2 MBA will go down a bit hopefully.",
  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget ‚Ç¨2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years. As longevity is important, I believe performance is an important criteria. My current setup is an 8th gen Intel i5 Asus laptop (8/256) and a M4 Mac Mini (24/512) on the desk. I want to replace both of these items with a single Windows laptop and I'll sell the Mac. I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around ‚Ç¨2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. ‚Ç¨2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. ‚Ç¨1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. ‚Ç¨1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. ‚Ç¨2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. ‚Ç¨1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. ‚Ç¨2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. ‚Ç¨2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** ‚Ç¨2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",
  "Have you ruled out Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024 or 2025)? It is a cheaper Asus ProArt with the same of internals.  These Asus model carry the best speakers of all Windows laptops which is nice to have if you have kids or others to share a screen.",
  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",
  "Question: why are you listing high refresh rate laptops? Is that something you want?\n\nBecause I doubt you‚Äôll max out that refresh rate in games unless you play older games or competitive online games.\n\nEdit: nvm just saw you don‚Äôt care about games.",
  "Have you considered a HP ZBook?",
  "T14 Thinkpads",
  "Update: Added the Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) to the list",
  "I did but seems a little difficult to find them not overly priced in Ireland.",
  "I'm doing some research on the P14s this morning.\n\nDirect from Lenovo I can get the Ultra 9 185H, no operating system, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 3K IPS display for ‚Ç¨2370.\n\nA local retailer has the Ultra 9 185H, Win 11 Pro, 32GB RAM, 1TB performance SSD, 2560x1600 @ 90Hz display for ‚Ç¨1790.\n\nI don't think the better display is worth ‚Ç¨600.",
  "Also, unlike the ProArt you don't need to pay for a 4070 you said you wouldn't be using much. The 16:10 screen is also good for web development with it's bit of extra height. P1's are also pretty much the top of the Thinkpad scale, being workstation laptops and thus very solid. P1 gen 7 is also 17mm thick and 2kg so pretty portable.",
  "You're right, I never game but do appreciate a nice smooth screen. High refresh rate is not a must have but more a nice to have.",
  "I will take a look, thanks",
  "Thanks. A lot of praise online for Thinkpads",

  "What laptop should I get? I'm an engineering student who also works in research and coding, and I'm looking for a new laptop. I was currently using my dad's old ThinkPad T450s, and it lasted 8 years and still works smoothly, but the battery life has deteriorated a lo,t and it's just not portable anymore. I'm looking for a new laptop on a more student-friendly budget that would work well with VSCode/Vim, Linux, and VMs. Here are some of my choices:\n\n**ThinkPad E-series 14:**\n\n* Intel Core Ultra 5 125U Processor (E-cores up to 3.60 GHz, P-cores up to 4.30 GHz)\n* 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\n* Windows 11 Home\n* Cost: ‚Çπ68.9k\n\nI don't know much about the quality and performance of the ThinkPad E-series, though. Since it has a U-processor, I'm a bit unsure about its performance.\n\n**Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3:**\n\n* 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13620H processor\n* 16GB RAM LPDDR5-4800 | 512GB SSD, expandable up to 1TB\n* Cost: ‚Çπ66k\n\nHonestly, the processor seems good, but I've heard negative reviews about the build quality of IdeaPads.\n\n**MacBook Air:**\n\n* Apple M1 chip\n* 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage\n* Cost: ‚Çπ59k\n\nAlthough I've heard positive reviews of MacBook Airs from professionals, the storage throws me off a bit, and many people don't recommend them for college.\n\nSome of the other laptops I've considered are Lenovo LOQ and ASUS, but these are my personal top choices. If you guys have any suggestions for any other laptops or experience with any of the laptops listed above, I'd appreciate any advice.",
  "I am also looking at laptops but I can say one thing for sure. **Do not buy a MacBook**, a lot of engineering software is not compatible or doesn't run well. I get that they are attractive in terms of battery life and power but it's just not good for this type of work. \n\n\nI also noticed that intel works a bit better with low level programming and is a bit more stable with Linux. The new intel CPUs are quite nice with battery life and performance. \n\nFrom the laptops that you provided I would get the ThinkPad with intel 5 125U, the performance is alright, I am using a Ryzen 5 5600H and this intel is better in every way. The build quality on ThinkPad was always ok, the E series are a budget friendly for people that can't buy a T series or X1.\n\nEdit: the CPU in the IdeaPad is going to be a bit more powerful in computing but the integrated graphics are way worse and the power efficiency is also worse, so I guess if you value battery life and graphics, the ultra is the obvious choice.",

  "Chuwi Gemibook XPro N150 ‚Äì Budget-Friendly Performer? My Review and Thoughts After testing the Chuwi Gemibook XPro N150 for several weeks, here‚Äôs my detailed take on this budget-friendly laptop and whether it delivers for everyday use:\n\n**Design and Build Quality:** The Gemibook XPro sports a minimalist, no-frills design with a sleek silver aluminum finish that belies its price tag. While the chassis is primarily plastic, it feels surprisingly sturdy for a budget device. At 1.46 kg and 19.9 mm thick, it‚Äôs lightweight and easy to toss into a backpack. The bezels are slim enough for a modern look, though not as razor-thin as premium ultrabooks.\n\n**Display:** The 14-inch Full HD IPS display is a highlight. Colors are decent for basic tasks, and the 1920x1080 resolution keeps text sharp. It won‚Äôt wow creatives, but for streaming, browsing, or document work, it‚Äôs perfectly adequate. IPS ensures good viewing angles, though brightness peaks at \\~250 nits, manageable indoors but struggles in direct sunlight.\n\n**Performance:** Powered by the Intel N150 (twin Lake, 4 cores, with up to 15W TDP), this isn‚Äôt a powerhouse, but it‚Äôs not meant to be. For light tasks like web browsing, email, and Office apps, it handles smoothly. Multitasking is limited; don‚Äôt expect to run 20 Chrome tabs while editing photos. However, the 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD (upgradable!) ensure snappy boot times and app launches. ARM software compatibility issues? None here, it runs standard Windows 11 Home.\n\n**Battery Life:** The 38Wh battery delivers about **3.5 hours** of mixed use (browsing, video streaming), which is solid for its class. It won‚Äôt outlast premium laptops, but it‚Äôs enough for a workday if you‚Äôre frugal.¬†\n\n**Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 provide reliable wireless performance. The port selection is impressive: dual USB-C (3.0 & 2.0), USB 3.0 and 2.0 Type-A ports, HDMI 1.4, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a DC-in jack.\n\n**Keyboard and Trackpad:** The keyboard has serviceable keys that are a bit shallow but quiet and responsive for typing. The trackpad is plastic, not glass, so gestures can feel slightly sticky. It gets the job done, but don‚Äôt expect MacBook-level precision.\n\n**Software Compatibility:** Full Windows 11 support means no app limitations. Need Zoom, Spotify, or even light Photoshop? Runs without a hitch. Gaming is limited to older titles or indie games (think Stardew Valley, not Cyberpunk).\n\n**Heat and Noise:** The fanless design means dead silence, even under load. The bottom warms up slightly during prolonged use but never gets uncomfortable. Perfect for quiet environments like libraries.\n\n**Overall Thoughts:** The Chuwi Gemibook XPro N150 is a budget gem for students, casual users, or anyone needing a secondary laptop. It nails the essentials: portability, a decent screen, and enough power for everyday tasks. At \\~$237, compromises are expected (performance, premium materials), but the value is undeniable. If you‚Äôre eyeing an affordable, no-nonsense machine for work or study, this deserves a look.\n\nHas anyone else tried the Gemibook XPro? How does it fit into your workflow? Let‚Äôs chat!\n\n",

  "Student Laptop Recommendations. With graduation coming soon, I've decided to figure out what laptop I'm going to buy for college. \n\nAfter posting a very similar question in r/Mac the other day, I was gently steered towards thinking about a windows computer - more on why later. \n\nAnyways, I'll put some info about my preferences, and then some of the major contenders I've found so far. \n\nI would really appreciate any suggestions, or feedback on the laptops I've narrowed my search to. \n\nMy Use Case: \nI am planning to major in finance. This is a huge reason I've been steered away from Macs. I love Macs and have used them all my life, but the excel compatibility seems like a dealbreaker. Outside of basic stuff such as excel, word etc. I plan on doing light to moderate gaming, and lots of general browsing and streaming. Nothing crazy intensive though.\n\nI should note I talked to my school - I *could* get through the finance program using a Mac, but it would be a pain. \n\nWhat I value: \nThe most important thing for me in a laptop is that it should be superb build quality, and have great longevity. I'm ok with paying a bit of a premium for those things. I prefer sleek minimalist designs, and often find \"boring\" designs tbe most attractive. After that, i would like it to be snappy, and handle daily tasks with ease. Doesn't need to be a powerhouse but i never want to notice it running slow doing mundane tasks. Lastly, I want this to feel at least somewhat premium as far as my touchpad and keyboard. I would especially prefer haptic touchpad \n\n\nSome options im considering:\n\nApple MacBook Air(M3) - as much as I've been steered away from it, a small part of me still wants one. This one is almost out of the picture though\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X9 14 aura - I really like this one. I think it's come as close as any I've found to meeting my needs from what I've seen. The only issue is price. The very lowest configuration I'd feel comfortable buying is around 1400 on Lenovos website, and sadly I don't have time to wait for sales as I need to get this ASAP so I can get familiar with windows OS. That 1400 is stretching my price range a lot further than I was hoping to go.\n\nWindows surface 7 - This comes in a close second to the ThinkPad. I LOVE the design, and the build quality seem amazing as well. I love basically everything about it... except the ARM. I've looked at my schools software requirements and I can't find anything specific that doesn't run on ARM, but It makes me nervous and the lack of gaming is also a bit of annoyance to me\n \nLenovo Slim 7i 14 aura - this guy is really compelling to me in the value department, and does almost everything I want really well. As stupid as it sounds, it really bothers me that there's no haptic trackpad, and I've seen some review say that the display and build quality are a little lacking, especially compared to some of the other laptops I'm considering \n\n\nAny insights are greatly, greatly appreciated. Please yell at me if I'm overthinking something, let me know which of the laptops above you'd recommend, or bonus points if you give me a different recommendation. Thanks!",
  "Lenovo bad. HP better? IdeaPad Pro 5 (8845HS) and Yoga Pro 7 (155H) vs Omnibook Ultra 14 (AI 365) Hi everyone!  \nSorry for the click-bait topic. I want to ask about buying HP over Lenovo. In order to make this post more valuable, I'll write down a short review of the Lenovo laptops because I found many people are looking for similar things in a laptop as me. Also including the OLED vs IPS opinion. I'll add 8845HS vs 155H review later.\n\nOriginally, I wrote a long post, but I didn't save it and it got lost. I'll try to make it short this time.\n\n**What am I looking for?**  \nI want a small work laptop that I could also use for my personal things. It should have good CPU, 32GB of RAM and 100% sRGB because I intend to use it for editing photos while traveling. I also wanted iGPU because it's good enough for the tasks I intend to use it for.\n\n**Why I don't want OLED**  \nOLED screen is dominant in the class of laptops I am looking at. And generally it's a selling point of many laptops. I understand why, but it's no good for my use-case.  \nI use a lot of static content Programming/Lightroom/Web and when I am working, I want to use my laptop as a second screen, which means opened browser or a VS Code for extended periods of time. Of course, this is exactly the use-case that's not great for OLEDs. I also went to a local shop and I saw that the OLED screens have a burn in. I understand that the laptops might be there for a long time, but still.. I don't want to limit my productivity to mitigate something that's going to happen sooner or later. Also the eye strain is real. So it's an IPS for me.\n\n**IdeaPad Pro 5 14AHP9**  \nThis was a big step up from ThinkPad E590 I had before. The performance is great. It's even better than 5600X I have in my PC. But I was being worried about the OLED burn in too much in the long run. Otherwise it was a perfect choice for me. \n\nPros:  \n\\- Very good specs  \n\\- Full metal case  \n\\- Good keyboard  \n\\- Good connectivity with 2 USB-C (USB-4), 2 USB-A and a SD card reader  \n\\- 85Wh battery  \n\\- **Quiet**\n\nCons:  \n\\- Very limited customizations  \n  ThrottleStop doesn't support 8845HS, you can't do much in the BIOS, you can't adjust fan curve  \n\\- OLED burn in  \n\\- 240Hz PWM\n\n**Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14IMH9**  \nI was hesitant to choose Intel because I believe AMD is better, but it has a nice IPS display and it fit my requirements perfectly.  \nI don't know if it's because of the Intel processor, but it's **loud.** Every time it get's above 60C, the fans just start spinning for some time. The CPU reaches 38C in the mean time. WHY?. And it happens even while browsing. The fans are also very high-pitched and annoying. The fan curve from Lenovo is terrible and I couldn't change it. It behaves like that in all power modes. Lenovo restricts any customization for some reason. It's very annoying and that's basically the only reason why I am looking for some other options.\n\nPros:  \n\\- IPS with 100% sRGB  \n\\- Very good specs  \n\\- Full metal case  \n\\- Good keyboard  \n\\- Thunderbolt 4  \n\\- 14.5\" display with minimal overall size change  \n\\- Good light use efficiency thanks to E-cores\n\nCons:  \n\\- Terrible fan curve (loud)  \n\\- Power button located on the side means accidental shut downs  \n\\- Only one USB-A  \n\\- Very limited customizations  \n  ThrottleStop doesn't support 8845HS, you can't do much in the BIOS, you can't adjust fan curve\n\n  \n**IdeaPad Pro 5 14AHP9 vs Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14IMH9**  \nBoth look very much the same and I really like the design. Yoga is a bit larger thanks to the 14.5\" display which is better for productivity and you can't really tell when carrying it.  \nThe build quality is better on the Yoga. It has a more premium feeling, but it's really not noticeable. The only noticeable things are the bezel around the screen is glass vs plastic on the IdeaPad. Another thing is keyboard, which is meant to feel more premium on the Yoga. It has a great travel but it's harder to press than on IdeaPad that's why I prefer the IdeaPad keyboard.\n\n**Ryzen 9 8845HS vs Intel 155H**  \nAMD is definitely more power efficient during moderate tasks. I think it's also part of the reason why IdeaPad is more quiet. \n\n**HP OmniBook Ultra 14 (AI 365)**  \nThis is an option I am looking into and I want your opinion on it. It's about 150$ more expensive, but it has a newer ZEN 5.  \nI'll share my cons and pros about this laptop. What I would really appreciate is your experience with the noise. Also if you can do more customizations like a fan curve using FanControl.\n\nPros:  \n\\- ZEN 5 (quiet?)  \n\\- IPS with 100% sRGB  \n\\- More customizability?\n\nCons:  \n\\- Worse design  \n\\- Large bezel (the laptop is the size of Yoga which has 14.5\" vs 14\")  \n\\- USB-C in the corner  \n\\- More expensive  \n\nWhat I ultimately want to achieve (and what is achievable with the IdeaPad) is that I want my laptop dead silent during some light work.\n\nI hope somebody will be able to share their experience and help me decide. I also hope I could help somebody else decide!\n\nThanks!",

  "Bought : Asus Zenbook i5 1340p flip ASUS Zenbook 14 Flip OLED (2023), Intel Core i5-1340P 13th Gen, 14\" (35.56 cm) 2.8K 90Hz OLED, Thin & Light Laptop (16G3/512GB SSD/Iris Xe/Win 11/Office 2021/75W Battery Blue/1.5 kg), UP3404VA-KN542WS \n\nHey guys! \nToday I bought this laptop. I actually wanted a Samsung book 3 360 but in my city it was not available and I needed laptop Urgently for my competition. \nThe thing is I'm not tech savvy so my dad's friend recommended him Asus vivobook 15 (i think) which is also 2 in 1. So we went to the store and told the salesman to show it. He showed us the abovementioned zenbook model and said they also  vivobook too but he tried convincing us that zenbook is evo certified and what not. Now keep in mind that I wanted a 2 in 1 laptop only so this option looked good too... or atleast it sounded good. \nTo make the long story short we bought this laptop for 86000 Indian Rupees. \n\nNow I think I made a wrong decision. Can someone please help me? My work generally includes- reading tons of materials online, researching and MS words and PowerPoint. \n\nAlso I couldn't find much review of this laptop online and now I cannot sleep thinking I could have gotten a much better laptop for a lot less amount.

  "Working with text on OLED screen Hello. \nI'm choosing a laptop. Mainly for working with text: ide, Ms office, browser. There are several models that fit my budget (Up to $1500). But they all have OLED screen.\n\nThis:\n-Asus vivobook s16 M5606WA (Ryzen HX370)\n-Asus vivobook pro 15 N6506MV (core ultra 7, 4060)\n-Lenovo yoga pro 7 14ASP9 (Ryzen 365)\n-Asus ZenBook S16 (HX370)\n\nAfter reading reviews of these laptops, I found that they have low PWM frequency when brightness is reduced. (Less than 50%). For example Lenovo has a PWM frequency of 240Hz, with brightness below 56%. ZenBook has 480Hz with brightness below 30%.\n\nI often work on an old laptop (ips) with a desk lamp on. The light in the room is off. The main question for me: if I continue to work in such lighting on a new laptop with OLED and reduced brightness. Will my eyes get tired?\n\nIt's just that in the country where I live, there are no laptops with IPS display and new Ryzen. There is only the possibility to order Lenovo Thinkbook 14+ 2025 (it has IPS and Ryzen 365) from AliExpress. But with the duty it comes out more expensive than buying in local stores.",

  "Looking for durable, long lasting, quiet, bright laptop. Doesn't have to be really performant. Good day!\n\n**===== Mandatory requirements =====**\n\n**\\* A good battery life**. So CPU+GPU isn't needed, APU should be enough. For communication, light programming, light 3D design, light music production in Ableton with not many VSTs, and similar tasks. Kind of \"a machine for a student\", I guess?\n\n**\\* A good build quality**. Probably full metal then, right? I don't want to deal with broken hinges and similar problems. I'd like to be able to throw it into my backpack and don't worry too much about breaking it (to an adequate limit, of course).\n\n**\\* A silent cooling solution**. I shouldn't hear fans at all in any tasks except heavy ones: VS+VSC in debug + browser with many tabs opened + etc.; Ableton in high quality with many VSTs. If APU is relatively weak, so it's not able to deliver high performance, but it never makes the laptop noisy too -- alright, that's fine too. It doesn't have to be the latest tech.\n\n**\\* A bright, colorful screen**. I have a bad experience with other laptops (some were older models, some were newer) loosing maximum brightness relatively rapidly. So, as for a typical no-brain consumer, my first though is to battle this with the higher maximum brightness, say 500+ nits. What, in most, but not all, cases, automatically means an OLED screen. What lies along the \"colorful\" requirement. I don't have a huge fear of burn-in, I'm using a Steam Deck OLED since launch and an OLED smartphone for a few years; but feel free to warn me if you see a need, you're welcome. IPS is fine too, but OLED is preferable. But overall, if you think that the idea of battling the problem of \"loosing maximum brightness\" with higher maximum brightness is dumb -- I'm all ears.\n\n**===== Optional requirements =====**\n\n\\* Small pleasant touches that everyone wouldn't be against having in their own laptops. Like a **comfortable keyboard** (I type a lot, like really a lot, well, you see yourself), **precise touchpad** (this would be great, to be able to finally efficiently use laptop without mouse), **nice sounding speakers**, **many ports** (especially USB-C), **fingerprint reader**, **low weight**, **fast and stable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth**, etc. Would be nice to be able to charge it with USB-C port, not DC, but probably that's already included in modern laptops, and I'm just not aware. Okayish webcam (if it doesn't have a shutter -- no problem, I'll glue it with a tape myself üòÑ).\n\n\\* **I have nothing against ARM** APUs (M1, M1 Pro or Snapdragon; I don't see a need in M2 and newer, but we'll see), but I don't want to be a beta-tester and especially pay for it with my own money. I don't want to have VS/NPM/VST/.NET (not .NET Core) and other more common-usage (old software) compatibility problems. May this even cost me a small(!) downgrade in price, performance, or battery life -- reliability is more valuable to me. So **x64 is preferable**. But if you have pleasant personal experience with ARM -- I'll gladly listen to your arguments, why not.\n\n\\* If the laptop doesn't suck air from the bottom (or does, but not only from there), so I **can calmly throw it on any surface including a sofa or a pillow** \\-- that'd be nice.\n\n\\* **A touchscreen, or even a transformer**. Just a nice feature in some apps, say in Internet browsing, but I can live without it. By the way, I just caught myself thinking that, on practice, transformers may actually be even more durable because of those 360-degree-rotating hinges. I wonder if that's true ü§î\n\n\\* Size? Hm... 14\" is probably alright, but I lean more towards **15\", and even 16\"**. Less portable, sure, but it's worth it. I have a moderately performant device with a small screen already -- my smartphone.\n\n\\* I think **16 GB of RAM** should be enough for a device of such performance. As for the **SSD capacity -- the more -- the better**, depending on the price. To the point of also having a quiet but big (few TBs) HDD inside as well (but that may be too old-fashined and so rarely present nowadays, I assume üòÑ). **I have no problem with opening a laptop** and replacing the SSD, if I feel satisfied, and I'm going to keep it. Same about adding more RAM in the future (if it's not soldered, of course).\n\n\\* **Antiglare screen coating**. Not a matte, but a slightly matte -- antiglare. After using a Steam Deck OLED 1 TB with such a screen coating I've started loving it and would like to have it here too. If can be purchased separately -- no big deal, I can purchase and apply it myself. But, probably, then better the screen be glossy, right? To not end up being too matte, after applying the external antiglare coating.\n\n\\* **If x64 then AMD APU**. I have trust issues towards Intel. But if you see them pointless -- alrighty, I can try Intel too.\n\n\\* **60+ Hz screen, preferably 120 Hz**. Yes, even OS UI animations become more pleasant to look at.\n\n**===== What about examples I've found already in this subreddit and not only =====**\n\n\\* **Macbook Pro 16\" M1 Pro 16/512 or 16/1024**. Yes, ARM, compatibility problems (potential and confirmed). But if x64 alternatives are much worse and/or much pricier -- seems like I'll have to deal with those problems then, spend personal time on relearning a lot of things (never used Mac before).\n\n\\* **Macbook Air 15\" M2 16/512 or 16/1024**. Older 13\" is way too small. And this is at the same price as a Mac Pro higher, so I don't see a point in this one.\n\n\\* **Asus Zenbook 14 OLED UM3402YA**. A lot of complaints on the noise, but an interesting variant.\n\n\\* **Lenovo Yoga 6/7, Yoga Slim 6, Yoga Pro 7, Yoga Slim 7 Pro**. Brightness looks very low (300-400 nits), but except that -- this is the closest I've found. There are complaints about noise too, but, in comparison, there seem to be not as many of them (of complaints).\n\nThank you in advance and take care of yourself üëã Ready to answer more aiming questions if needed. Will look for it in Europe. Budget: \\~‚Ç¨1000 for something interesting just not performant, \\~‚Ç¨2000 for something both interesting and performant (Mac Pro).\n\n**===== Updates =====**\n\n1. [Asus Zenbook 14 UM3402Y](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Zenbook-14-UM3402Y-laptop-review-New-Ryzen-7-7730U-name-old-Zen-3-performance.724864.0.html)\n\n*\"Asus advertises a peak brightness of 550 nits which we can confirm only when displaying HDR content. When running* [*this HDR test*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlAsAuBtmps)*, for example, we're able to record a maximum brightness of 542 nits on our test unit. Otherwise, maximum brightness is limited to just \\~340 nits when displaying SDR content which is still in line with most IPS-based subnotebooks.\"*\n\nWTF Asus? I've been relying on this characteristic so much. Welp, at least taking this into account will now add quite a bunch of other models into the pool of \"interesting\" ones. A lot of IPS screens, for sure.\n\n2. Apple MacBook Pro 16\"\n\nThe same, 1000+ brightness is awailable only in HDR, in SDR its \\~500. WTH?",
  "laptop for grad school (i‚Äôm stressing) (i can‚Äôt make decisions) Hello guys! \n\n(TLDR at the bottom)\n\nI need help on deciding which laptop I should buy. I have had an HP Spectre x360 14 since the beginning of 2020, and it has finally given up on me‚Ä¶ well I‚Äôve given up on it. I have had so many issues with this laptop since I first received it, but I was loyal to it since it was a gift. But recently, the battery has completely given out and I don‚Äôt want to send it in for repair when I think it is just time for me to buy a new one. \n\nAnyways, I have been researching laptops to buy before the next semester begins as I really need a laptop for grad school. However, I am stressing! Every time I think I have found a laptop that would work, reviews are extremely mixed or just outright bad (was 2024 a bad year for laptops??). My criteria for a laptop isn‚Äôt extremely demanding, I don‚Äôt think. But here are my criteria: \n\n1. Applications - I need to run applications and GIS software that are pretty powerful. \n\n2. Battery life - um‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt want it to die within 4 to 5 hours of standard use. \n\n3. Life Span - I need a laptop that will last me for another 4 to 5 years, one that could take me to the end of my doctorate degree. \n\n4. Price - No real budget. As long as the price is well justified. If I could get a cheaper laptop that does the exact same thing and has the exact same specs as a more expensive one, I‚Äôll go with the cheaper one (duh). \n\n5. Gaming - I like to game. And by gaming, I mean Minecraft and Sims. As long as I can run these two games (not simultaneously obviously) without my laptop crashing and over heating, I am happy.\n\n6. Fan Noise - I just don‚Äôt want to hear an entire fucking airplane taking off every time I have more than 5 tabs open on Chrome. (it‚Äôs embarrassing and annoying as shit)\n\n7. Not an HP. \n\n8. All the other good stuff - Good RAM, storage, screen resolution. I spend A LOT of time on my laptop. I want to enjoy it. \n\nOkay maybe, it is a little demanding. But please help. I need it. \n\nTLDR: I need a new laptop. I spend a lot of time on my laptop. I need it to last for at least 4 years. No real budget. It should be able to run heavy GIS software and some programming apps. I need it to have a good battery life, low fan noise, light gaming capabilities, and for the love of God, not an HP. \n\nMy choices so far have been between (but not limited to) the Lenovo Yoga 7i Aura, MacBook Pro 14, and Asus Zephyrus G14.

  "Tuxedo Infinitybook 14: Initial Impressions I say initial impressions, but at the time of writing this, I've had the machine for a few days, and I've had plenty of good opportunity to get to know it.\n\nTLDR: I'm impressed with this laptop. I feel like I've gotten great value for the price, and I'm highly satisfied with the purchase. I don't see where to leave a review on their website, so I was hoping to find a good place to leave one on reddit.\n\nYou can find the store page for this device [here](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-Pro-14-Gen9-AMD.tuxedo#gallery).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5e6znjnv55e1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=85f0bab3cab7eebd5905348347449d75ff6228fc\n\nSo, let's get into some specifics\n\n**System Specs**:  (many of which are configurable)\n\n* Price: 1266.23 Euro / 1384.92 USD\n* Display: 14\" IPS (I think) 2880 x 1800, 400 nits\n   * Refresh Rate: 120, 60, or 48 Hz\n* CPU: Ryzen 8845HS\n* GPU: Radeon 780M (Integrated)\n* RAM: 32 GB DDR5 at 5600 MHz\n* Storage: 2TB\n* OS: Opted for none preinstalled, Installed Arch Linux\n* Battery: 80 Wh\n\n**Context**:\n\nI sought out this laptop after using a Surface Laptop Go 2 (hereafter, SLG2) and loving it, but I wanted to address some of the weaknesses that laptop had (Small storage capacity, small RAM capacity, Low res 1024p display, and lack of keyboard backlighting), while maintaining it's strengths (very portable, good image quality despite low resolution, good feeling keyboard and trackpad)\n\n**Introduction to Tuxedo**:\n\nTuxedo makes laptops especially for Linux use, but I don't see any reason one can't use Windows as well if so desired, and Tuxedo even offers to pre setup dual boot options and Virtual Machines at the buyers descretion.\n\nTuxedo also leans into the \"right to repair\" philosophy. In terms of the Infinitybook, 6 screws easily open the chassis, and access to the internal components are pretty wide open. More upgrade / service tasks should be possible, and overall easier compared to most other laptops. Notably not to the extent that Framework enables, but still really good.\n\n**Chassis and IO**:\n\nThe chassis is made of aluminum, and feels very sturdy. It does feel a little \"chonky\" or \"robust\", but in a good way. I have confidence it will last for a long time, and maintain good condition easily. The design does use tapers to help it feel a little more slim than it actually is. My wrists are sensitive to ergonomics, and I'm not sure what it is yet, but I'm finding something here to be a slight improvement over the Surface in terms of keyboard comfort.\n\nDuring my purchase, I wasn't sure how I was going to like the hinge design. I do like it slightly less than that of the Surface Laptop Go 2, but the Infinitybook is designed in such a way as to allow some IO out the back. I think I'm going to be happy with this trade off.\n\nThe Infinitybook offers plentiful IO, and I find that refreshing in todays laptop climate of what feels like a push toward IO minimalism.\n\n|Left Side (back to front)|Back Side (left to right)|Right Side (back to front)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Kensington|HDMI 2.0 out|USB 3.2 x2|\n|USB 2.0|USB-C 4 (charge enabled)|SD Card Reader|\n|USB-C 3.2 (charge enabled)|Ethernet||\n|Headphone / Mic|||\n\nIn comparison to the SLG2, I think Chassis quality is maintained, IO is vastly improved, and portability is slightly sacrificed, but not too bad.\n\n**Display**: 14\" 2880 x 1800\n\nThe display was an area where I was really motivated to see some improvement. I was fairly impressed with what the SLG2 was able to do with a 1024p display, but I did feel that 1024p is a little too low for today's standards\n\nThe display is not touch capable.\n\nI believe the display on the Infinitybook is IPS, but I didn't find it clearly stated in the documentation. I was hoping for OLED. Regardless of which method it actually uses, the resolution is excellent, and the contrast is excellent. Side by side, the contrast is noticeably better on the infinitybook over the SLG2. If it is in fact IPS, It's way beyond my expectations of IPS, and I'm totally satisfied.\n\nI've opted to run the display at native resolution, and at 48Hz in the interest of favoring better battery life. It still looks good.\n\nDisplay Scaling is a little bit awkward at this size and resolution. 100% tends to be too small, and 200% tends to be too large, but Desktop Environments handle scaling differently and have a different range of capability, so I'll share some of my findings. I'm using Wayland whenever possible.\n\n* Gnome seems to work best at 200% scaling with text scaled down within gnome-tweaks\n* KDE Plasma has fairly robust scaling support, and works much the same way as within Windows. It should be fairly easy to get it dialed in right, and I find 150% - 175% is most comfortable\n   * Tuxedo has their own OS, which uses KDE Plasma by default\n* COSMIC: is currently in alpha 3, and I think I actually found it more usable in alpha 2. I think COSMIC really just needs more of its settings to be made available, and it should be good to go. Regardless, I was able to make things sized appropriately, just not so easily.\n* I also have Cinnamon and Qtile installed, but I haven't had an opportunity to try them yet.\n\nWhile I did actually like the 1024p display on the SLG2, it is a no-brainer that the Infinitybook is a pretty big improvement. Scaling for the most part is a \"set it and forget it\" experience.\n\n**Mouse and Keyboard**:\n\nThe keyboard is membrane, but well balanced, and has good travel. They keys are easy to hit. I opted for US English ANSI, even so, the layout is slightly different from what I'm used to. This is not a complaint, rather, just an acknowledgement that it will take some time to re-train my hands. Otherwise the typing experience is pretty good. Perhaps not *the* best, but not far behind.\n\nThe trackpad is generously sized precise, and has a very satisfying click. Initially, something did feel a little bit off with cursor acceleration, but I've already gotten used to it.\n\nOverall, The fact that this keyboard has 5 step backlighting is an improvement over the SLG2. Otherwise the typing quality is roughly the same. The SLG2 also had a relatively generous trackpad, so I think my satisfaction here is maintained.\n\n**Storage and RAM**:\n\nMy SLG2 had a 128GB NVMe, and while I made due with that, there were times I needed to use an external drive. Even before considering the external drive though, I've already loaded almost 128 GB worth of things onto my Infinitybook. I'm sure to go further in the near future. I think I was ready for an upgrade in this department.\n\nThe Infinitybook also has an NVMe slot inside that I'm not yet using. Bonus points for expandability.\n\nIn Windows 11, and even on laptops, I was finding 8GB of RAM to be a little too limiting. On the SLG2 (also with Arch), 8GB was plenty for most ultrabook type tasks. But given the move from Intel to AMD, as well as the more robust, possibly overkill cooling solution, I think the Infinitybook may have reach into some decent gaming. If that's indeed the case, I expect I'll be able to make use of 20, maybe 24 gigs, so I do have comfort room here.\n\nOverall, the Storage and RAM are both significant improvements, and will enable me with more flexibility moving forward...\n\n**Gaming**:\n\nI haven't had the opportunity to really test gaming yet, and for the most part, I've only been playing low demand indy games on my laptops. Neither of these laptops broke a sweat with Stardew Valley, but I don't know much more than that yet. I will explore this more in the near future.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, There's good cooling capability in the Infinitybook. I have heard the fans, but it's never been anything near obnoxious.\n\nRegardless, I know the Infinitybook has more reach than the SLG2... How much more is yet to be seen.\n\n**Battery**:\n\nBattery was never an issue with the SLG2, but with stronger components, more cooling, and over triple the pixels with themselves are brighter and capable of more contrast, it was interesting to put the Infinitybook through it's first few tests. Above I mentioned that I opted to run the Infinitybook at a refresh rate of 48 Hz. This really isn't necessary. Some benefit may be seen moving from 120 to 60 Hz, but here, I'm really just taking an extra step to conserve resources. I still have the option to reduce CPU power draw and fan curves in the bios, and even without that, I still have plenty of battery to go about my day without intermittent charging.\n\nMy satisfaction with battery is high, and improved given the difference in power between these two devices\n\n**Audio**: (Disclaimer, I'm no audiophile, and I'm also a headset person)\n\nI believe I've only had one laptop so far that didn't have an audio jack. It wasn't the SLG2, and it's not the Infinitybook... It's unclear to me if the laptop industry is phasing audio jacks out or not, but I thought it was worth mentioning that the Infinitybook does include one...\n\nIncluded audio sounds like down firing speakers. They don't get overly loud, but the sound quality seems good, and seems to have pretty good reach into trebles, mids, and bass. I don't think they meet the Mac expectation for speakers, but among all other laptops, I think they're pretty good. There's no tinny sounds, no straining, no obvious distortion.\n\n**Running Linux**:\n\nTuxedo's stated purpose is in part, to make hardware for Linux use. As expected, I've experienced no problems with installation, drivers, or any incompatibilities.\n\nSometimes wifi can be a pain point on Linux. With the infinitybook, I was able to just assume an \"*iwctl // station wlan0 connect* SecretNetwork\" would work, and so it did.\n\n**Smaller Notes**:\n\nMy single complaint so far is that I requested a US power adapter, and received one that seems to be meant for Australia. I have a spare, so no harm no foul, but if Tuxedo sees this review, beware of that.\n\nIt was a little tough to get the payment through to Tuxedo, but Paypal did the trick.\n\n**Lifestyle**:\n\nI'm a fairly frequent traveler, mostly for business, and for those purposes I value portability, flexibility, durability, and making my experience with TSA as easy as it can be. At home, I'm a gamer, and tech mega-nerd. I know I'm going to appreciate the IO options, the nicer screen, and the better power and cooling\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nIt's still early, but so far I feel like this laptop is well equipped to maintain the aspects of the SLG2 that I liked, while addressing the weaknesses that I didn't. In terms of value, I feel like I'm actually getting a lot for the $1384. I'm incredibly pleased with the device, and I really just wanted to share it.\n\nTuxedo has done a great job!\n\nThat's it for my review. I may come back with updates or tweaks as I get to know the Infinitybook better, but other than that, I hope this review is informative and helpful, even though it's mostly from an experiential point of view. Feel free to ask any questions.",

I guess the difference in performance should be minimal since they have the same processor. The main use is office work. I'm on the road a lot so battery life is important. If I'm not on the road I plan to use it with a dock. I work in construction so build quality is also important.\n\nHere's what I found so far:\n\n# Battery Life üîã\n\n* Asus ExpertBook: Various reviews show a mixed picture of the battery life, so I'm curious to hear about your experiences. It looks not as good as the Vivobook.\n* Asus VivoBook: Andrew Marc Davids review on YouTube Show really great battery life.\n\n# Build Quality üõ†Ô∏è\n\n* Asus ExpertBook: Again mixed reviews online, specifically about the hinges\n* Asus VivoBook: Looks well built, not a lot of reviews\n\n# Screen Quality üíª\n\n* Asus ExpertBook: 14.00 inch IPS, matte 16:10, 2560 x 1600 144¬†Hz\n* Asus VivoBook: 14.00 inch OLED, glossy 16:10, 1920 x 1200 (WUXGA) 60 Hz\n\nThe Expertbook has a higher refresh rate and more ppi, but I think the OLED of the Vivobook will be just fine and will have nicer colours.\n\nI‚Äôm wondering what the ExpertBook offers for the extra price. However one big plus is the extra M.2 slot.\n\nThe laptop is for work. Are there many advantages to a business/professional laptop like the Expertbook?\n\nIf anyone owns either of these laptops, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts! Especially on battery life, durability, and overall experience. Which one would you pick? If you have completely different suggestions, I‚Äôd love to hear them too!",
  "very niche purchase advice... A very long post! Thanks for any advice for those who have the patience to wade through....\n\nI need to replace by laptop within the next few months, and I am trying to think creatively about a combination of tech solutions that can get me what I need professionally and personally. I‚Äôve been trying to self-educate about specs, but please be kind where I am ignorant! \n\nFirst, I need a laptop with a certain amount of juice‚Äî I currently have a surface book 2 i5-7300U CPU; 8GB RAM; 256 SSD; 16‚Äù screen and it‚Äôs pretty laggy for me. I use chrome a lot, and run qualitative and quantitative data analysis programs (remotely for now, but probably more locally in the near future)- I‚Äôm thinking minimum Core i7 or Ryzen 7 and 16GB DDR4, and 512 SSD. Things like high quality graphics aren‚Äôt important to me.\n\nSecond, I also would like some kind of tablet-like thing that I can use primarily to read and mark up a variety of document formats and take hand-written notes. I got the surface because of the detachable screen, but I find it too big (at 16‚Äù) and awkward to use regularly. I also got a hand-me-down remarkable to try, and I like aspects of it, but syncing documents and annotations back to my laptop felt cumbersome. and I eventually stopped using it. I don‚Äôt necessarily need the ‚Äúsensation‚Äù of paper or a distraction-free environment remarkable offers either. I just looked briefly at BOOX, and liked I could write in a greater variety of apps and (maybe?) sync across devices more easily because of the android OS.\n\nBasically, I‚Äôm trying to get as much functionality across devices for as little combined money as possible (maybe a total $1000 max)?\n\nOne solution could be going with a different 2-in-1 laptop‚Äî I‚Äôd just want it to be 14‚Äù screen or less, based on my experience with the surface ( I have a monitor that I hook up to at home and the office, so it‚Äôs ok for it to be smaller)- the reviews for Lenovo\n\nOR I could get some combination of tablet and computer and try to get what I‚Äôm looking for for under $1000\n\nOR‚Ä¶‚Ä¶? Other thoughts?\n\nTwo other notes:\n\nIn terms of OS, I am actually agnostic‚Äî I have always had android phones, but used to use a mac computer, before I switched to PC/Windows. I don‚Äôt really care, except my impression is just that the whole mac ecosystem integration is more expensive as a whole.\n\nI‚Äôm open to refurbs, but am trying not to add that to the mix with all my other variables at the moment‚Äî I can look for deals once I get a sense of the models I‚Äôm shooting for.",
  "ThinkBook as a Home/Family Laptop I recently came across Tech Beau's excellent and glowing review of Thinkbook 14+ with new Core Ultra Processors. And since I am in the market for a new home system which everyone in the family can use(read abuse), I wanted your opinion on how good it would serve the family. \n\n  \nInitially I was thinking of getting the Yoga, if possible please draw comparisons between the product and which one would suit my usecase.\n\n  \n",

  "Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9 (2024) vs. HP Spectre 14 (2024) - Quick Comparison / Personal Impressions Hi all,\n\ndecided to post a quick review / comparison because I see a lot of people are facing similar buying decision.\n\nI own an Intel 11th generation Yoga 7 Slim 14 inch laptop and am looking for something new. The Yoga 7 is really creaky, has really bad speakers and - main reason I want to switch - only has 60hz. My main monitor and smartphone have 120hz and for me its the biggest innovation in years. I only have a laptop paired with an eGPU (RTX 3060) for desk setup, which works pretty well. I also thought it would be nice to have a 2-in-1 laptop for travelling, long haul flights etc.\n\nTo cut a long story short, after some research I decided on the HP Spectre 14 and the Yoga 9i 2-in-1, both with the latest Intel CPU. I pre-ordered both, so I received each of them with almost no reviews (and therefore no BIAS) out there.\n\nBoth versions had new Intel CPU 155H, 120hz (glossy) OLED screen. The Spectre came with 32GB, the Yoga 2-in-1 with 16GB. I wont talk much about performance because it doesnt really matter for me. There are now benchmarks out to compare.\n\nthe sad news first: I returned both laptop\n\n||HP Spectre 14|Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Design|+/- Personally, I didnt really like the design. Its way better / professional predecessor, but I still dont like the bulkiness and the cut corners of the spectre. Looks somehow awkward for me.|No great design as well. Its somehow looks like an unproportional burger. The top of the laptop is smaller then the bottom, in combination with its rounded and glossy edges it looks very akward. I chose colour \"cosmic blue\" which is okay, but a fingerprint magnet|\n|Build Quality|+ Very nice build quality, solid materials - not creaky at all. Very good hinge.|+ Very good, cant complain. Not creaky at all.|\n|Speakers|+ Very good speakers. Quality reduces drastically if you use in tablet mode, since the speakers actually play in the opposite direction|+ I think the best speakers I ever heard on a laptop, since its basically a huge rotating soundbar. This is great in tablet and tent mode as well, because the sound is still going in your direction|\n|Trackpad|+ Very nice haptic trackpad, definitely the best trackpad I ever used (on track with Macbook Pro)|-/+ Trackpad is only ok. Its not haptic, which is a dissapointment in their flagship|\n|Keyboard|+/- Keyboard was ok, but I don't understand the hype about it. I might be biased because I use Lenovo notebooks at work and home for years.|+ Keyboard is nice. But as said, Im biased / used to use Lenovo keyboards. I didnt like the additional row right to the \"return\" button|\n|Display|- Overall, a very nice OLED screen. But no matter.  The screen was absolutely terrible in terms of the 'screen door effect', I couldnt stand the graininess. I had read before that this could be a problem, but I was sure I could get used to it, but in reality it was an absolute nightmare.                   - Another annoying issue with the screen is that it is barely dimmable. I often use the laptop in bed/dark surroundings to stream something before going to sleep. The lowest dim level is still super bright. You have to use extra software to dim it.|- Nice OLED as well. Drastically less Screen door effect to a level I could live with. Also, its dimmable to very low brightnesss out of the box. Unfortunately the screen is super glossy. I mean, so glossy that in dark enviroment even the backlight of the keyboard is reflected.|\n|Other|- The \"Power On\" button is illuminated constantly, which is very annoying|-|\n\nAs I said, I have returned both laptops. I paid around ‚Ç¨1700 for each and each had major faults that did not justify the price for me. The main reasons were the displays, I think glossy is just not for me. While I could live with the Yoga's display, I really missed the haptic touchpad and hated that it only came with 16GB.\n\nThe search continues. I think im done with looking for 2-in-1 and will get a tablet instead. Basically all I need is \"good/very good speakers, haptic t rackpad, non glossy and minimum 90hz screen\".  I have now pre-ordered the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4, which has a matte display and a haptic touchpad, unfortunately it is only 13.5\".  I also assume that the speakers will be bad. Will keep you posted :)\n\nHope it helped!",
  "I'm deciding between these 2. The 2-1 format would be useful for document reading etc, but the glossy screen issue is a deal breaker.   \n  \nCan anyone attest to the effectiveness of a matt screen protector to counter act the reflection?",
  "THANK YOU. Finally, someone who actually addresses the screen door effect in both flagship models. I work in the professional visual industry and need crystal clear displays, or at least with less graininess like e.g. Surfaces. I got both the Yoga 7i and Spectre for comparison and it drove me insane. I'm returning both and ordered the 9i now after reading your review - I found a model with 32GB RAM.\n\nOut of curiosity (and to better justify my money spent...) - Would you surmise you would've kept the Yoga 9i if only it had 32 Gigs of RAM?",
  "Do you know if either laptop supports legacy S3 sleep?",
  "lmfaooo please give an update fast. I was looking to buy either of these and now I don't want to.",
  "I am looking for a similar laptop. Thinkbook 13x is really tempting but 14‚Äú would be even better. A bit outside of the box but the new DELL precision 5490 is on the game for me. 14‚Äú Matte bright IPS touchscreen, nice CPUs, etc. You can choose it without dGPU.\nOr maybe upcoming new HP elitebook x360 if it comes with a H CPU.\nMaybe Huawei Matebook X 2024 is an option, no release date on Europe yet.",
  "u/peyta30 FYI, the 2-in-1 Gen 9 is now available with a Sensel haptic touchpad upgrade in the \"Build Your PC\" tool. Right now it's showing as a $60 upgrade, but once the 2-in-1 goes on sale, that discount will also apply to the haptic touchpad.\n\nFYI, the haptic touchpad in the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4 is not from Sensel.",
  "Hey so I've also been tied between the Lenova Yoga 9i pro and HP Spectre 360 16 inch. Both in 32 GB. The main difference is HP uses a OLED screen but 2800X1800 Res while Lenova Uses LED 3200X2000 Res. The lenovoa looked brighter. The other difference is the HP is 2 in 1 where as the Lenova has the Ultra 9 core processor and HP has the Ultra 7 core processor. So one is newer processor and higher resolution. The other is 2 in 1 and OLED screen oh and the HP has much better speakers. My issue now is that there is another Lenova yoga 9i option which is only $200 more which comes with a Mini LED screen, a higher graphics card 4060X, and 1200 Nit brightNess which is exponentially higher then HP and most other Laptops. The ONLY problem I've seen with that higher Lenova 9i option is that the battery is listed at 5 hours but people have claimed it barely lasts 3 hours. Sigh* If it didn't have the battery issue, I'd get the fully loaded yoga 9i in a heart beat so now I'm still tied between the original 9i or HP Spectre both in 16 inch 32 GB with same graphic card.",
  "Sorry I don't know that!",
  "I'm trying out new Asus g14 and skipping touch screen for now.",
  "Hi! That sounds interesting. On which configurator are you referring? I can't find the option on German or US configurator. Anyways, does that mean that you now provide a 80x135 haptic trackpad? \n\nThanks",
  "fsfs lmk. Touchscreen isnt a dealbreaker for me. Just on the fence rn bec he sale for the Hp spectre ends tmr.",
  "Oops! My mistake. Sorry about that u/peyta30, I read \"2-in-1 Gen 9\" and my brain automatically went to the [ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 Gen 9](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx1/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-2-in-1-gen-9-(14-inch-intel)/len101t0085).

But HP have zero technical support and horror stories from consumers on forums about... well, everything.\n\nASUS long ago turned trash.\n\nDELL are over-priced and make units with whatever components were cheapest that day.\n\nAre any companies worth buying from?

I have a small hub for my MBA that has all those connectors you're asking about.   To be honest I forget it's in my workbag most of the time because it's so rare that I need it.",

Dell XPS 13 is also good, and if you‚Äôre worried about price you could by refurbished or buy a model from the Dell Inspirion series.\n\nAlso, if you want a thinkpad similar to ones during the IBM era, I think the T480 is what you‚Äôre looking for.",

  "256GB enough for college students? I've finalised my options for Windows and MacBook according to my budget at RM4499/ 960USD.  \nWindows: Asus Zenbook 14 Oled Ryzen 7-8845HS 16GB RAM 512GB SSD (RM4299/ 920USD)  \nMac: MacBook Air M2 8GB RAM 256GB SSD (RM4499/ 960USD)  \nI'm thinking of just getting the MacBook Air but am worried about the storage but at the same time I'm worried about the longevity of the Zenbook. If I were to get the 512GB version of the MacBook Air it would cost me RM5599/ 1200USD. so which do you think is the better buy MacBook or Zenbook regardless of software. And also in some reviews I've seen that the Zenbook matches the battery life or is even better than the MacBook while having higher performance. Edit: Considering HP Pavilion Plus 14 Ryzen 7 7840U 16GB RAM 512GB SSD (RM3799/ 810USD). Superb display 2.8K 120HZ",
  "It is a question of choice really for you. 256GB SSD under normal circumstances can be more than enough but if you like to load a lot of Pictures, Videos, Applications then that space can quickly disappear.\n\nI am not sure that the MacBook Air storage can be upgraded after purchase, I think it is soldered (Perhaps someone more experienced can confirm this for me) and the RAM certainly cannot be upgraded. The price difference for essentially an extra 256GB storage is quite expensive.\n\n  \nOf the 2 I think for you the ZenBook might be a better option and longevity you can upgrade most of the components with ease (Storage and possibly RAM). RAM you will have to check if it is DDR (SODIMM) or LPDDR (Soldered chips) with the latter not being able to be upgraded after purchase.\n\n  \nBest of luck which ever one you decide",
  "My sibling has a MacBook Air with an i5 from 2015 and is still using it so I expect the MacBook Air M2 to last as well but will the Zenbook slow down eventually or is it the same as MacBook? because my brother had a ROG STRIX with a Ryzen 5 and battery got crappy and performance too after 3 or 4 years",
  "Yes, I mean it all depends on maintenance. Batteries are consumables and Generally Gaming laptops are far harder on components and heat cycles because they are worked far harder.\n\nWindows will also slow down over time if neglected like disk cleanup, temporary files etc.\n\n  \nOf course Apple Silicone is far better for its purpose but all technology will fall behind the software eventually and not be as fast as it once was.\n\n  \nLaptops typically have a service life of 5 years but many last much longer. My Lenovo ThinkPad T440s is still going strong and will have been in service 10 years this year. I do have a more modern ultra portable laptop though.\n\n  \nIt sounds as though you are leaning towards the MacBook Air and if upgrading components does not bother you then it might be better for you.\n\nOf course a 2015 MacBook Air won't be as good as it once was and will still have slowed down, that is just the electronics lifecycle.\n\nIt is all how you maintain it, both hardware and software.",

Hey there, r/laptops!\n\nTo preface, I am a laptop refurbisher that has poured several hundred hours into working on (repasting, liquid metalling, undervolting CPU/GPU, upgrading panels/storage/Wi-Fi cards, etc.) several dozens of different laptop models over the last \\~18 months, which include some of the following:\n\n* GIGABYTE Aero 15X\n* Razer Blade 14 & 15\n* Many Dell Latitude and Inspiron variants\n* XPS 13 & 15 Variants\n* HP Elitebooks\n* Various Thinkpad variants\n* Various Alienware variants\n* Surface Book 2 13.5\" and 15\"\n* MacBook Pro 13\"/15\" (2013-2015 variants)\n* Acer Helios 300\n* Acer Nitro 5\n\nThe list goes on, but I think this list covers the majority of laptops that are being purchased regularly in the past few months, secondhand or otherwise.\n\nI wanted to spread some of the knowledge I've accrued over the last year and try to help people that may be hunting for a new laptop this Black Friday/Holiday or looking for one as a gift for a loved one/friend/family member.\n\nI'm going to keep the guide itself short and sweet, and provide my recommendations for each \"genre\" of laptop I can think of, with some light rationale behind my choices.\n\n**Best \"Jack-Of-All-Trades\" Laptop (Including gaming):**\n\nGoing to have to go with the Aero 15 variant from GIGABYTE on this one. It has the same footprint as the XPS 15, which is already quite compact, while sporting some powerful GPUs and color-calibrated 144Hz or 4K panels. It also rocks a 94WHr battery, making it an amazing productivity machine whilst on the go thanks to Optimus. Many of their units have went on sale on Amazon in the last few weeks, including the 1660Ti unit and the RTX 2070 mQ unit, both being awesome choices for gaming and video production/acceleration. **Runner-up choice for me is the Razer Blade 15, but ultimately loses due to a higher price point and smaller battery.**\n\n**Best \"Dedicated Gaming\" Laptop:**\n\nThis one is a no-brainer for me. If portable gaming (at a desk) is the sole purpose of buying a machine, I am going to have to go with the ASUS Zephyrus S, specifically the unit with the keyboard shifted downward to make room for cooling. This machine can be configured all the way up to an RTX 2080, and has pretty much unparalleled cooling capabilities, making it my favorite choice, as many of the other thin/lights struggle with cooling the CPU when its pulling 45W and above. Look at some reviews from BOAT or OwnOrDisown and you'll see exactly how cool this thing runs! **Runner-up choice for me is the 17\" variant of the Lenovo Y740, which had even better thermals than the Zephyrus at a lower decibel rating, at the expense of a \"meh\" build quality and chonky bezels.**\n\n**Best Ultraportable (13-14\") Laptop:**\n\nXPS 13, specifically the 9360 configured with 8th-generation i5s/i7s. The 9370/9380 no longer have a USB-A port, which is super important to have to avoid having to bring a dongle everywhere you go, but still has a USB-C port to charge with. It's still incredibly small, has a great keyboard layout, and amazing screens, like the rest of the XPS lineup. It also still has upgradeable SSDs, unlike the 7390. Not to mention the amazing battery life of the 1080p variant!\n\n**Best Ultrapremium Laptop (No/light gaming):**\n\nFor the money, you can't beat a good deal on a refurbished XPS 15 9570/7590! They are very easy to service, have insane battery life for the FHD AND 4K variants, and offer excellent CPU performance for its size with some undervolting. I know there are some QC issues acknowledged in the Dell subreddit, but that is why I always recommend buying a refurbished unit, which go through more rigorous QA testing than new units do, and also come with a 1y warranty that is upgradeable. **Runner-up choice would be a similarly spec'd Thinkpad X1 Extreme, but is typically more expensive than the XPS and the 1080p screen is only 300 nits, compared to 400 and 500 for the XPS 15. It also has a smaller battery, but does weigh less.**\n\n**Best Hybrid/2-in-1/Artist Laptop:**\n\nAlthough pricey, the Surface Book 2 (with the dGPU base) is absolutely extraordinary for what it can do. It has insane battery life despite its ridiculously bright screen and high DPI, great color accuracy and responsiveness for drawing/content creation, and enough horsepower to get most people through about anything. Of course, you can't really open/service this thing, so plan on buying an extended warranty if possible to protect your investment. Also, it seriously has such an amazing keyboard, it is such a pleasant experience to type on! My only nitpick is that the GPU runs quite hot when under load since the fan curve is super conservative unless you change the power plan to \"Best Performance\". **Runner up would be the XPS 15 9575 with the i7-8705G and Vega M graphics for me, but falls short in battery life and its versatility when compared to the tablet mode of the SB2.**\n\nThat's about all I can type without cramping up for now \\^ \\_ \\^\n\nThus, feel free to comment any questions you may have about any model laptop you've been looking at/comparing against, where to find a good deal on a specific unit, what specs someone may need depending on workflows, anything you may need help with this Holiday season :)",
  "Hey bud, so, looking for a mid tier laptop around the ¬£1000/¬£1200 mark, I'm happy to play at 1080p, 60fps and not fussed about ray tracing. As much as I've used a PC for long time and can do plenty with them, I'm no PC tech. \nMy desktop rig had an i5 4690k, AMD RX480 8gb, 24gb ram, SSD's and HDD's etc etc, not a super computer either but wanting something with more oomph and some future proofing. \nHad my eye on either a ryzen 7/i5 even an i7, and a 1660ti maybe rtx2060 just for the future proofing thought.

  "Any thoughts on more general use laptops on a sub-$1000 budget? I'm looking to spend about $850 max. \n\nI'm considering laptops like the HP Envy 13 & the Zenbook UX333FA-DH51 (open to any/all suggestions). \n\nBoth have pretty compelling deals over at Microcenter. \n\n1.

I'm not looking to go beyond Vega8/10 or MX150/250.  Frankly, most of the older games that I'd be interested in playing will likely run with or without a dedicated graphics card.  I'm not looking to spend extensive amounts of time during the semester gaming.  I want something fairly light, with solid build-quality all-around, strong battery life and moderate performance.  Gaming aside I have pretty typical student usage habits; streaming video/audio etc.  \n\nDo you have any suggestions for things to watch out for with refurbished laptops? I've been out of the laptop game for a long time and while the specs are crazy (for a non-gaming laptop) at this price-range I'm also a little leery because it seems too good to be true? I've had my fair share of laptop performance issues with overheating parts, bad cooling, hinges, HDD/MOBOs and I'm really not looking to repeat that sort of thing while I'm in school and focused on taking classes.",
  "Hi! Thanks so much for answering questions. I'm a student just looking for a 15.6 inch laptop for everyday use (browsing, homework, streaming). In Canada at Costco there is a hp envy x360 Ryzen 7, 8 GB RAM, 512gb ssd, comes with the stylus. It is $849.99 Canadian dollars.

  "Hello Sir, I've [posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/e0ue4f/help_me_get_a_laptop_thatll_last_for_the_next_46/) on r/suggestalaptop already but I'd love it if you could give me some advice. I'm looking to splurge on a laptop that'll last me for the next ~5 years or so. This is my first time buying a laptop; my family used and old Compaq Presario which was new in 2006 when we bought it and we're still using it today! We use a PC for most things but I really do need one for college now. \nI'm looking for a beefy machine that can play games at ~120fps, 1Tb SSD, with a good graphics card (based on what I saw on shopineer, an RTX 2080 seems the way to go). I'm also taking up video editing as a hobby and am planning on doing a post-grad in machine learning as well, so ideally I'd want a powerful GPU (which seems to be taken care of by the RTX 2080) and a powerful CPU as well (Intel i9?). 32 GB RAM (or 64 built-in) is a must as well. I'm also looking at dual-booting with a version of Windows called LTSC, which I hear is reliable and non-bloaty and Ubuntu 16.04. What laptops would you recommend?",
  "Hi, \nThe Yoga c940 seems to have pretty good reviews as a laptop. Was that part of your consideration set or was there anything in particular that made you drop it from the list?",
  "Hi,i need some advice completely new to buying laptops for gaming specifically.im on a budget so console idiot over here.since the black friday sale is coming up i need help with choosing a gaming laptop under 600.im not really picky i just want to play the new games with decent stable fps.",
  "Hi. I am thinking of buying a laptop. \nI have just realised that I am not a gamer anymore. So I think I need more 17 inches than 15. I do a lot of stuff using Excel, hard Internet browsing (50 bookmarks +), beginner at photoshop and that is all I think.\n‚ÄúMobility‚Äù (17 inches - crazy!) is a matter for me because I am going to use it outside as often as I could. So should I go for i7 9750 or something less efficient. ?\nReliability is one of the most important thing. I hope using my purchase for at least 5 years.",
  "Thanks for this post! Very helpful. I'm interested in the ultra-portable/premium group with touch screen support, at least 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD, decent battery life, with some ports (or minimum thunderbolt for decent docking or eGPU) and deciding between the XPS13 (or 2-in-1), HP Spectre x360, or RBS. All seem to have new updates for late 2019, and I'm currently leaning toward the HP Spectre. Have you had experience with HP Spectre machines and quality or issues? Thoughts on any of HP's \"business\" models that fit in the same niche?",
  "If gaming at a high refresh rate is a priority, I would still go with an Intel H-series 45W CPU, as they have much larger caches and better single-threaded performance than the Ryzen 7 3750H counterpart. I did own that Zephyrus G for about a week, and I actually did like it for its battery life and overall build/footprint.\n\nI would stay away from the ASUS TUF, I haven't heard anything particularly great about that lineup.\n\nI have heard that the newer 1660Ti Helios 300 is a solid $1000-mark gaming laptop, despite it being bulkier/more gamer-y.\n\nThe HP Omen you mentioned has a reputation for poor CPU thermals (even more than its competition), and to be frank I'm not a fan of its design language.\n\nSSDs are typically very easy to upgrade, as long as the motherboard is not inverted like the MSI GS65.\n\nOut of your options, I like the Zephyrus G and the Helios 300 15.6\" variant.\n\nHope I helped!",
  "Fresh install of windows. I wouldn't say it's necessary to go any further than that. An SSD would be a great addition but I wouldn't say it's necessary because the HDD is compromised or anything.",
  "My question to you before I answer is, do you need a socketed desktop CPU in this device? Or would the mobile i7-9750h/i9-9880H\\[K\\] work for you?",
  "I am going start off with that I am not an expert on laptops, but I do own the Legion Laptop with similar specs. (Different GPU, 2060, and just 1 1TB SSD)\n\nThe laptop is pretty good for what I use it for. I have been able to run every game I have wanted so far. The battery life does not matter because it is a gaming laptop. I get about 4 hours before I need to recharge my laptop again. That does not really bother me because I use this as a portable desktop. I never plan to use this near people due to the jet engine sounding fans. \n\nThe battery life for the legion does not matter because it seems it was geared more towards a portable desktop if that makes any sense. I travel with this laptop just fine, but I won't whip it out and start typing a report on the train. It does weigh quite a bit and barely fits into most backpacks. \n\nI hope this makes sense and gives you a rough idea to how I experience the laptop.",
  "Battery life is pretty abysmal on the Y740, but pretty much outperforms the MSI in every other way (thermals, noise levels, etc.) \n\nThe MSI is also lighter, but is nearly impossible to upgrade/maintenance with ease due to the inverted motherboard.\n\nBecause I am so keen on servicing my own laptops and I hate inverted mobos, I'd choose the Lenovo despite its shortcomings.",
  "I'd go with that HP Envy you linked; they are basically the HP Spectre, without the Spectre pricetag, and use mostly the same materials in their build.\n\nAs far was what to watch out for, just make sure all the ports work, there are no dead pixels, and that the thermals under load are acceptable. If all those check out, you should be good to go. \n\nThere really is no way to validate/check if a motherboard is about to die, but you can check the health of a hard drive with CrystalDiskInfo when you purchase a refurb! :) Sometimes there's some leftover manufacturer warranty on those refurbished units as well, check the S/N when you purchase one and see if you get lucky!",
  "I'm not entirely too familiar with the Canadian market for electronics; are they typically just more expensive when compared to the US? Because for $640 USD (which is what it converts to), those are respectable specs for a laptop given its price! :)",
  "I've owned two Razer Blade 15s in the past year, and I found the build quality of the machine to be exceptional, on par with a MacBook Pro. Zero chassis flex anywhere, sturdy hinges, the whole 9 yards. I think the challenges and issues that arise with those machines come from a lot of the heat introduced from the CPU and GPU that gets dissipated to the rest of the machine, particularly the VRMs and the motherboard. If you do a good job with keeping thermals in check, I think the Razer Blade is just as capable in the longevity department as any other brand, bad luck aside.",
  "I LOVE THINKPADS! The X1 Carbon is such a badass machine with an amazing keyboard, and is super lightweight. I had a 7th gen X1C and fell in love with it, wishing I could keep it but couldn't pass up the profits from selling it.",
  "The Precision will have a bigger battery, be slightly lighter/smaller, and probably throttle a bit more under dual (CPU+GPU) loads.\n\nThe P53 will definitely be a better choice for heavier, more consistent loads for rendering/AutoCAD, as long as you don't mind the extra weight of the machine. It has a 90WH battery, too, so its not like it won't last a long time either.\n\nI'd go with the Lenovo in your case.",
  "Any laptop that is thin/light that houses an i9 will throttle, so its often recommended to save the money on the CPU and put it towards the GPU for a gaming laptop, so we should probably stick with an i7-9750H, instead.\n\nHow important is battery life to you? How thick (or thin) can this machine be?",
  "I actually just never have used it or had my hands on one personally, so I don't really know much about it outside what I've read. Thats the only reason :)",
  "Ah mate brilliant, helped a ton! Like I said it would've been a dice roll in the end. Will look at the fund situation when I'm ready to make a purchase, the Zephyrus and the Helios have around ¬£200 difference at the moment and both are equally tempting haha.\nThanks again man.",
  "New SSD with a new install of Windows. All worries of a virus should be crushed by then. :)",
  "i was thinking the mobile i7-9750h would be more than enough and is at reasonable price point currently. also the rtx 2070 mobile and 2070 max Q mobile seem at a good cost to benefit ratio too. was thinking the non max-q 2070 mobile if the thermals are ok.",
  "Thank you!",
  "Thanks for the comment! The last time I had a laptop were like 1st or 2nd gen Intel; so I really want to get something that has solid build quality and will last.  UHD Screens tend to eat up a lot of battery life; I wish MicroCenter had the normal 1080p screen, but it's pretty difficult to find an MX 150/MX 250 with good build quality on a budget! \n\nThe conservative side of me is leaning towards the UX433 or maybe a slightly upgraded Envy via HP.  I don't really need a 4K screen or a touchpad -- they're just really cool as a value proposition.",
  "Hi thanks for the reply! Yes all electronics will be more expensive here. For example a macbook air is $1449 CAD vs $999 USD (approx)\n\nThe Intel i5 version of this laptop is $999 CAD on sale (integrated graphics, 8gb ram, 512gb ssd).",
  "Thanks for the info!",
  "How does it compare to the XPS 13 in your opinion?",
  "No problem :)",
  "Great thanks! So there's no way of storing a virus on the motherboard or ram?",
  "Would the 17\" Lenovo Y740 work for you? The 2080 Max-Q variant can be had for sub-2k when it goes on sale, and performs amazingly well, as the max-fan mode grants the GPU 10 more watts to use under load, and the thermals on my last unit were absolutely fantastic. It benched better than most desktops!",
  "Oh, I would definitely go with the $849 Ryzen version and upgrade it to 16GB of RAM if it isn't soldered then!",
  "X1C has a better keyboard and slightly better thermals under load, but is louder and has a dimmer screen (when comparing FHD to FHD and 1440p from Lenovo to 4k from Dell). It also has slightly worse battery life, if I recall correctly.\n\nXPS 13 definitely has a better screen and is quieter under most loads, and the 1080p variant of it lasts forever on battery, nearly 12 hours in a web surfing test performed by Notebookcheck.\n\nI'm also pretty sure the XPS is cheaper by a few hundred dollars, especially if purchased at the right time from the Dell Outlet.",
  "Not that I am aware of!",
  "Thanks for the detailed response :)",
  "Looking for middle-class convertible notebook Hi,\n\nI'm currently looking for a new laptop and I'd like to hear some opinions on my thoughts before I actually buy a new one. As a little disclaimer - I have some but definitely limited knowledge about computer hardware, in particular, once it comes to graphics cards.\n\nMy main use-case is school and research-related work, i.e., doing calculations, taking notes, coding and mathematical calculations (C++, Python, Matlab, Mathematica), having zoom calls, doing stuff with word and power point. Occasionally, I play computer games (mainly city-building, build&conquer type games). I'm not a graphics fetishist, so I'm fine with running the game on mid to low quality if necessary, as long as the game still runs fluently without delays.Besides that, I already have a USB-C docking station from Dell in my office that I'd like to proceed using (as far as I know it's not proprietary, so it should work with most laptops smoothly).\n\nThus, I'm looking for a convertible notebook that allows me to turn the screen for writing on it with a stylus. I'm not a Mac-guy, so I'd like to go with Windows.\n\nI think for my research-related work, 16GB of RAM and  512GB - 1TB of SSD should be enough. I'm aiming for a screen-size of 14'' to 16'', regarding weight, I'd hope for 1.5-2kg but if it's a little more I'd be willing to compromise. Having a decent battery would be nice and since I'm typing a lot I'd appreciate a good keyboard. Also, it would be a nice add-on if the stylus is already included (but again, here I'm willing to compromise, if necessary).\n\nCurrently, for the little gaming I do, I'm using my 7 year old laptop (Asus UX3410U). I started realizing that it really reached it's limits, so I'd say the power of the graphics card built in there is definitely a lower limit to what the graphics card of my new laptop should be capable of.\n\nI know some would say \"buy a separate gaming computer\" but this is currently out of my budget and I think also not necessary for an occasional just-for-fun gamer like I am. Additionally, I am regularly commuting between two places and do not want to carry around two computers.\n\nMy budgetary limit is roughly 1500‚Ç¨ (so \\~1600-1650$).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you have any suggestions for notebooks that meet my needs?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, I have already done some research on my own. Seems like that my primary choice the Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2 (cheapest configuration) is still quite far out of my budget and also a couple of HP (Elite, Spectre) are still a bit above my upper limit, so probably\n\n* Lenovo Yoga 7 14IAL or  Lenovo Yoga 7 16IAP\n* LG Gram 16\n* ASUS Zenbook 14 Flip OLED\n* Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360\n\nare more realistic alternatives. What are your opinions on those? From what I get from reviews, all three of them easily meet my \"office\" requirements (writing on screen, running code,...). However, for all of them the reviews say they are not really suitable for gaming. Do you think that's only a relevant verdict for \"real\" gamers and, given that up to now I was totally happy with my middle-class 2017 notebook, for what I play they will be easily sufficient for a couple of years again, or do you think they might do equall to or even worse to my current computer?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

  "exact same situation as you :( the craziest game I'll probably play is genshin lol but I need my laptop to handle at least that - plus I'm not sure how overall performance/hardware would be affected in a convertible",

  "My review on Dell Inspiron 16 plus with RTX 3060 (60W) I got mine on Aug 04 2021 on a deal for only $1450. It comes with **i7-11800H, 32gb RAM, 3k display, 1TB SSD with RTX 3060 (60w), thunderbolt 4 and full size SD card slot**.\n\nBeing a professional video producer &amp; editor, I have been in search of excellent windows 4k RAW video editing laptop. I have bought tons of high end laptops in last couple of months and tried each of them with a real-time 4k RAW playback test &amp; 3 minute 4k timeline with multiple layers, color correction, effects, noise and infusions render test.\n\nThe best things about this laptop is the display. This is literally by far one of the most color accurate and sharp 3K display out there on the market. Everything looks darn amazing. The fans are on a bit louder side but you can keep it to quiet mode if you don't like it. But I think with performance mode the fans are understandable. Build quality is good but not great. The material is not XPS quality but it does feel premium. The overall look and design with 16 inch almost bezel less display is pretty awesome. As I prefer matter over glossy, this has clearly one of the sharpest screen on the market.\n\nThis laptop is tuned more towards creators for sure but obviously you can game on it too. But due to 60hz refresh rate this will not likely be a first choice for gamers.\n\nSo here is the real **render time** **result on Adobe Premiere Pro**:                                                                                                       (Prices may not reflect current pricing, these are the prices I bought it for)\n\n\\- **Dell Inspiron 16** plus i7-11800H, 32gb RAM, 3k display 1 TB SSD with RTX 3060 (60w) model = ***3 min 10 seconds*** : Price: $1450\n\n\\- **MacBook Pro 16\"** with 5600M, retina display, intel i9, 32GB RAM, 2 TB SSD  = ***3 min 47 seconds*** : Price: $3800\n\n\\- **Asus Zephyrus M16** RTX 3060, i9 -11900H, QHD, 16GB RAM, 1 TB SSD =  ***4 min 52 seconds***: Price: $1849.99\n\n\\- **Asus Zephyrus G14** with Ryzen 9 5900HS, FHD 144hz, RTX 3060, 16GB RAM, 1 TB SSD = ***4 min 24 seconds*** Price: $1449.99\n\n\\- **Asus Zephyrus G15** with Ryzen 9 5900HS,QHD, RTX 3070, 16GB RAM, 1 TB SSD = ***3 min 37 seconds*** Price: $1799.99\n\n\\- **Razerblade 15 4K OLED** with intel i7-10750H, RTX 2070 max-q, 16 GB RAM, 512GB SSD = ***5 min 38 seconds*** Price: $1699.99\n\n\\- (**Fastest**) **MSI Creator 15 4K UHD** with intel i7-10875H, RTX 2070 Super max-q, 32 GBRAM, 1 TB SSD = ***2 min 14 seconds*** Price: $1699.99\n\n\\- **Eluktronics Mech-15** with intel i7-10870H, FHD, RTX 2070 Super max-p, 16 GB RAM, 512 SSD = ***4 min 30 seconds*** Price: $1699.99\n\n\\- **Eluktronics Max-15** with Ryzen 7 4800H, QHD, RTX 3060 max-p, 32GB RAM, 1 TB SSD = ***3 min 10 seconds*** Price: $1599.99\n\nSo, if you look at the price value. Honestly, this laptop is a great buy. I think for creators, the 16:10 ratio with 3K resolution is the best part of the deal &amp; it does beat lot of high end laptops in playback and render time. There are several other reasons why I returned those laptops mentioned above( except this one) which is hard to explain all in here. But If you want to know, shoot me a message. I'll be happy to help.",
  "Thank you for sharing so much useful info! I‚Äôm signing up for Reddit to post this reply. One possible reason for what you observed could be Intel Quicksync doing some of the decode/encode assist. A quick way to validate is to turn iGPU off in bios or device manager. Another reason as you touched on in the comments is Premier optimization. Davinci Resolve Studio is much better at unleashing full GPU horse power. Do you mind sharing which raw codec do you work with? Also if you can post some Pudget benchmarks that would be really cool and standardized (they split by transcoding and effects etc). Thanks again for your post!",
  "Thanks for this!! Would you say it's worth getting the Inspiron 16 Plus over something like the Dell XPS 15 9510? I know the latter is the \"higher\" end laptop but it's processor doesn't seem significantly better than the Inspiron (i9-11900H vs i7-11800H), but the Inspiron's high end graphics card is much better (GeForce RTX 3060 vs the XPS's GeForce RTX 3050-Ti). \n\nI'm a graphic designer/video editor, so I'm looking for something that primarily has a good processor but also has a decent graphics card.",
  "This is a very useful comparison you‚Äôve provided here. Thank you for that. \n\nI‚Äôm fairly inexperienced and unaware when it comes to multimedia creation tools and the hardware/software support intricacies. Besides just the wattage of the GPU and CPU, what other factors would influence the render time ? \n\nIs the fact that the Inspiron 16 Plus is able to outperform the G14 entirely due to thermals and wattage ? Or is there something else at play here too ? And how come the Creator 15 is the fastest of the lot, while having last-Gen hardware across the board ? From what I can see, the machines with 32GBs of RAM are the ones that perform the best here.",

  "Great writeup! If you managed to open up the laptop, do you know whether the 1TB SSD comes in a 2230 or a 2280 form factor?  \nFrom what I see the laptop has [two PCIe slots for SSDs](https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/1/5/csm_MG_4491_f59cd10fbc.jpg), one 2230 and the other 2280.  \n2230 sizes are very difficult to find and a lot more expensive than 2280, so if Dell ships a 2230 by default then that's a great win.",
  "What is battery life in office work usage? Web browsing. Word , excel etc.",
  "Thanks for you insight as well. \n\nYes, I did turned off the iGPU and did the render. The result was same. I mostly shoot in Blackmagic RAW 4k. So, I have been using Da Vinci Resolve studio version a lot. And yes it completely uses GPU and it's a faster and better render program than Premiere pro.  Those tests on Premiere pro was for the office work as they have not moved to Da Vinci yet. \n\nThe pudget benchmarks are not working with Adobe suites at the moment. Whenever it is fixed I'll share it here on the post.",
  "And for my own experience, M1 8gb RAM Mac can export almost as quickly as my 2020 Asus G14 (2060mq) using a73 h264 footage, in Resolve Studio. M1 can even playback 8k h265 footage from Sony a1 in 4K timeline, while the G14 choke due to Nvidia h265 hardware decoder not as good as M1",
  "If you simply look at the graphics, yes RTX 3060 is better. But it‚Äôs not always the graphic card that makes your work flow easy. \n\nIf you decide to get all maxed out dell XPS 9510 vs Inspiron 16, then i would say 9510 would be a better choice. But if you want display, processor, graphic card with less money üí∞ to spend then Inspiron 16 is better.",
  "I'll answer accordingly.\n\nMe and my colleague have been in frequent contact with Dave2D and JarrodTech on their discord channel. All of them are amazed on how MSI creator 15 outperformed all the high end laptops by miles on the test. Since I do tons of RAW video editing, I have made sure all the settings are perfectly matched and timed.\n\nSo to answer your question, after tons of test I found out, to render that level of RAW codecs with such speed CPU-GPU combination has to be perfectly compatible with each other and work in sync. When I monitored the CPU-GPU usage of MSI or Dell Inspiron 16 for that matter, during render, both were using almost 100% of their limitation of CPU & GPU at the same time while laptop like Asus M16 & Razerblade lacked that level of synchronization. Even manufacturers and engineers are not aware of those details because they only test the basic usage & thermal compatibility when building the machine & not the specific software usage. That's why most of the manufactures send their pre-unit to reviewers and let them test bunch of software on it and find out what works better and what not.\n\nSo, I came to know that it's not always a most powerful gaming laptop that beats the tests. It's the compatibility and the drivers that have been specifically optimized for the task outperforms the other. So laptops that are specifically designed for creators beats out other powerful gaming laptops on those test. I forgot to mention in my post that **MacBook Pro M1** with 16GB RAM & 512 SSD renders that same test in just **4 min 10 seconds** beating out some high end gaming machines. So, you see it's the optimization that works better when using apps like premiere pro and Macs are always known for their optimization of CPU-GPU with the applications.\n\nHonestly I don't have an exact answer to this question on why Dell Inspiron 16 plus was able to beat G14. As i7-11800H in dell is faster than Ryzen 9 5900HS & also Ryzen 9 5900HX which is insane,\n\n[*https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-11800H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HX/m1542191vsm1449683*](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-11800H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HX/m1542191vsm1449683)*)*,\n\nthat might be one reason. In programs like premiere pro, the program tries to render the video using CPU first. If CPU thinks it can handle the tasks then it'll render itself but if it thinks its too much then it'll send the task to GPU. So I think dell's optimized drivers for that application, CPU-GPU synchronization are superior to G14s when using adobe suites. But while gaming G14 will be better because it is optimized for gaming. That's only logical explanation I can think of.\n\nYes, more RAM is always better but in all the test, no render needed more than 16gb of RAM. 11gb-15gb was the maximum utilization during the render. But personally, I believe 32GB is the perfect choice for anything.\n\nI hope I answered your questions.",

Btw I heard the hinges are a bit stiff on this model, is that true?  \nI remember that on my old Inspiron 7537 I had to loosen up the hinges after a few years.

  "Actually that's a really interesting question. As far as my test goes, I believe dell has outperformed because of it's integrated software & drivers. Also Intel 11th gen processor is in play here. If it was solely based on hardware then Mech-15 with RTX 2070 Super Max-P (130W) on a Beast Mode which has way better hardware & still lost to dell's RTX 3060 Max-Q (60W).\n\nAlso MSI creator 15 (which outperformed every laptop I have tested) has a creator mode, which you can turn on & it adds adobe programs automatically in the lists. So I think, if you really wipe out everything on the Dell and install fresh windows we might see a different result. I'll try that some day and will update here.",

  "Asus Vivobook Flip14 vs Thinkpad X13 Gen 2 All the following models are second hand, with only 1 week warranty. The store has good reviews and is seasoned. I've always thought Thinkpads would've fit me. I love Thinkpads, it's heritage and design. I was on a tight budget back then hence I opt for older Thinkpad models- I've grown attached.

But ig practicality says buy the vivobook! Also concern for both too is the price, when my parents, who are going to buy the laptop for me, see the price and that there is no 1 year warranty, they'll go nuts. Hence, it's better if it were a lot cheaper.",
  "Crelander E160 Anyone have this, or one of the multitude of other models that are the exact same thing on Ali Express?  It's not the one with the dual screens that's gotten a lot of press, but instead it's a 16\" basic laptop with a mechanical keyboard.  Just got it in today, and initial impressions are good.\n\n16\" screen is very bright, I think it might be 400-nit, if not definitely more than 300.  It's supposed to be 2560x1600 (16:10) resolution, but it's actually 3072x1920 (16:10) resolution.  Some people would say that's a good thing, I don't like it.  2560x1600 is the perfect resolution (IMO) for 16\", this is too high and I'm forced to use scaling.   Oh well, it is a pretty display, given after my coupons, rewards, and discounts I paid less than $350 with shipping and tax, I can live with it.\n\nThe keyboard is AMAZING.  Better than ThinkPads (which I have had a lot of) even.  The touchpad is...tiny.  Very tiny.  Works pretty good.  Requires a little more pressure on tapping than I'm used to.  Not sure if it has \"clicky\" ability, I use tapping.\n\nThe CPU is the Jasper Lake N5105, 10-watt TDP version of the Celeron N5100.  Quad core, quad thread.  Sufficient for daily use.  Just.  16GB DDR4 2400 soldered.  Intel 7265 Wifi 5 + Bluetooth 4.2 soldered.  I got the 128GB SSD version, and it does have an access panel on the bottom to change it out.  It's M.2 SATA.  I swapped it out with a spare 512GB I had that had been Windows 11 ToGo, since I can use the 128 for that without issue (only used it for updating BIOS on ThinkBook 14 G3 ACL which I'm selling anyway).\n\nThe Windows is GENUINE!!!  After installing the updated drive (exporting drivers first, there's a TON of missing drivers after an OS install on this) I reinstalled WIn11 Home, and as soon as I got online it showed activated with a digital license.  So that surprised me to see a Chinese knock-off laptop have a genuine install of Windows.\n\nOverall, for a basic system, this is...amazing.  Especially if you're getting it for office work.  It's very light (cheaply made), with a great screen, amazing keyboard.  Get a bluetooth mouse to use with it, and it'd be a fantastic basic office work portable to carry with.  It's not going to put up with abuse very well because it is all very cheap, very flimsy plastic, but for the price, this is actually a genuinely great laptop IMO.\n\nNow that I've tested with Windows, will be installing Debian 12 to see how it works there.  Just wanted to see if anyone else has used this, because I can't find any other reviews other than the LTT review (Brown Star for Effort ‚Äì This AliExpress Gaming Laptop is HILARIOUS).",

Asus X415 i7/16/1024 14\" laptop - ‚Ç¨699 (on sale. Ord. price ‚Ç¨1,299)\n2. Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro i7-12/16/512 14\" laptop - ‚Ç¨1,099 (on sale. Ord. price ‚Ç¨1,299)\n3. Asus ZenBook 14X OLED UX5401 i7/16/512 14\" laptop - ‚Ç¨1,399 (on sale. Ord. price ‚Ç¨1,599)\n4. Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro i5-12/16/512 14\" laptop - ‚Ç¨999 (on sale. Ord. price ‚Ç¨1,099)\n\nI was thinking option 1 due to the price and its specs based on my preferences, but I've read some bad reviews about. What do you think? TIA!"
