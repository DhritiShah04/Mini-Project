List which programs/games you desire to run.** \n \nCAD yes, video editing/photo editing no, gaming would be nice but if the sacrifice is cost and battery life then probably not worth it for me. I have access to consoles so I can live without for now. \n \n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** \n \nIf I could play something like Cyberpunk, Ghost of Tsushima on high or greater at 60FPS that would be a dream come true but if it's limiting to a 2/3 hour battery it wouldn't be worth it to me. \n \n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** \n \nReliable build, good keyboard and input devices would be ideal.

  "Ideapad 5 Pro with Ryzen 6600HS - Thoughts? I spotted the Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro (Part 82SJ0005US) sitting at $740 on Lenovo's website today, which feels like a pretty low price for a laptop with a Ryzen 6000 series CPU, 16GB RAM, and a 1 TB SSD. I'm curious about the 6600HS specifically since I can barely find any review of laptops that use it. Based on the higher TDP, I'd expect it to outperform the 6600U. Does anyone have experience with a laptop containing the 6600HS? I'd also be interested to know how the battery life is with a 35 W TDP chip. Thanks!",
  "It's amazing. The HS processor is only a level below the H processor and miles ahead of the U while still achieving great battery life.\nThe machine in question has a 75whr battery I guess, but I have a similar model and my battery lasts ages and doesn't even get noisy or heat up much when under heavy load.",
  "Hi, I’m considering the same one or the Intel one. Curious to hear thoughts.",
  "Ryzen H35 and Intel P28 are still branches of \"H-series\". These are CPUs targeted at professionals who do heavy-multi-threaded work, and who do not need super long battery life.\n\nYou will see a lot of tech reviewers mindlessly recommending laptops with these chips but they are not really made for casual users in mind.",
  "Yea this laptop looks great, and from the last gens performance this one should be pretty good, you should definetly look into it",
  "Did you end up buying this laptop? I'm currently considering this one over the Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro with 5825U CPU. I'm mostly interested if the 6600HS version will last a full 8 hour school day. Reasons to go for the 6600HS are the 660M GPU which will allow for some light gaming.",
  "I did buy this laptop and overall it's performing well, the 660M is a big step up from my previous device. In battery-saver mode I can get just about 8 hours of light browsing / note-taking, and I think there are more advanced ways that you can further decrease power usage.",

  "swift go 14 sfg14-72-53bp (125H, OLED) UPDATE: 4 months later. i love love love it. it's perfect for me. a 14\" MBP that can do everything that i could ever imagine. no problems thus far. :fingers\\_crossed:\n\n[https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72-53bp](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72-53bp)\n\ni was writing a comment on [Im planning on getting the Acer Swift Go 14 with the oled screen... is this a good idea? : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1dh9jne/im_planning_on_getting_the_acer_swift_go_14_with/) and basically ended up writing a review, so:\n\nI just got the 125H version (mis-posted as 135H) off eBay for $550 \"like new\"/\"open box\". It's incredible, especially when coming from a limiting chromebook and an even more limiting iPad mini, lol! The 125H goes for $850 and the 155H goes for $1000 on the Acer US store.\n\nof note: the older [Acer Swift X 13500H RTX 3050 version](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-x-14-laptop-sfx14-71g-5911) (an older *non-touch* IPS screen) is going for $800 new! That's a significantly better gpu, but likely more power-hungry and perhaps limited by the 65w battery and even 100w charger, but who knows: those AMD ryzens seem to do way better than the intels of their time. Highly likely to find one going for a low price compared to bigger names. The next jump is at $1300 for a new swift go 14\" 155H rtx 4050.\n\nhere's a quick useful video review about it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3I3q48674&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3I3q48674&t=180s)\n\nmajor notes:\n\n* **the version with the OLED screen does not have touch input.** I found this out the hard way. :( I guess i assumed that the swift's \"go\" series was like \"flipbook\" and \"spin\", in that the touch-screen is it's main feature, without the flipping/spinning part. I was wrong. (the 155H version has touch-screen: [SFG14-72T-71QF](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72t-71qf) along with a 16\" version. Look for the icon with a finger pointing.)\n\nmajor cons:\n\n* the battery life is lower compared to other ultrabooks, maybe 6-10 hours vs 10-14 hours zenbook, perhaps due to the 65w vs 75w battery(?). I can't say yet, and maybe windows (and it's bloatware) is still doing something, but i got 10 hours on my first three charges, draining at \\~10%/hour; But i also always use minimum brightness, and just had the normal 30 tabs open (edge, most tabs sleeping) with music playing. Conversely, perhaps because it has a smaller battery, it charges very very quickly: an hour or so (with the given charger). It's also nice that usb-c was standardized for charging, though i wished the usb-c cable would detach from the power block... A minor gripe. After the first few drains, i've kept the laptop charged, and used some pre-installed Acer program to limit charging when plugged-in (to 80%, no choice). This really is it's only major con.\n* the OLED is glossy. so glossy you can see a deep, deep, and rich reflection of yourself. It's like looking into a dark mass of water. It raises self-awareness and horror :cold\\_face:\n\nproblems likely similar to other ultrabooks, and other notes:\n\n* fan noise, and heat. when it speeds up, it's clearly audible in a quiet bedroom when it starts up. it can start with very little computering ([the zenbook got panned in a review for being worse](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Zenbook-14-OLED-review-The-1-2-kg-subnotebook-with-120-Hz-OLED-and-Core-Ultra-7.805236.0.html)), then it goes back to silent mode, and thankfully, *stays* silent. And when it's silent, it's *absolutely* silent! It's apparently not louder than it's competitors tho?? sounds fine to me... *Thank goodness!* Along with fan noise, it can get a little warm at the palms. I think this happened during the beginning of it charging. Thankfully, the aluminum(?) case ensures it cools down quickly, and keeps it cool. (this is my portable-desktop-laptop, wherein i plan to use a separate mechanical keyboard most of the time anyway). However, when it's not charging, it seems to stay quiet 'n cool, which is the most important time.\n* the speakers are bass-less, but the amp is surprisingly incredible(!!).. but then again, i've never heard good laptop speakers in my life. Zero bass, which i'm okay with, as i'm a dreamy-pop treble music person, but just say no to lo-fi/city-pop. It's interesting to hear bass guitars without the bass.. It reminds me of my old purple 'n gold ATH-AD700 headphones that i adore, but far worse mixing. The audio goes through some artificial spatial surround sound software: the mids seem to live recessed in the bottom center of the laptop (vocals), then are overtly forwarded to every direction / speaker in the artificial speaker system (piano), the highs are all over the place, moving from one part of the laptop to another; and the lows remind me of bad midi music. Your favorite music will *not* move you. You will however listen to your favorite music in a very different way.. Having said that, the speakers can get very loud, easily able to fill up a room(!!), and most importantly: beyerdynamic 300r 32ohm headphones sound great at a mere 10% volume!\n* the up and down arrow keys share a single key area. I use wasd for gaming, so it doesn't bother me. This also keeps the keyboard's shape to a neat rectangle.\n* the left modifier keys aren't big. they're the same size as the letter 'n number keys. The right modifier keys, however, are slightly wider. They had to do this to make space for the function key. UPDATE: i re-mapped/swapped left-control with left-alt, mac-style. much better. i'll likely re-map holding caps-lock to left-control too.\n* the keys feel only slightly better than my $40 samsung chromebook 4, which, now that i'm looking at it, surprisingly, has the big fat left modifier keys and complete arrow keys too! Not bad, that thing! (for programmers the tilde key and delete keys are nice to have, and nicely placed, as are the half-size function/special keys... tho, i'm scared of what bloatware the acer key will manifest..!) UPDATE: in retrospect, it's actually a great keyboard. I ordered a keychron k6, and those red keys are god awful. Seriously, who want's to press a key down for a one-half inch?? I've become used to the tiny distance of laptop keyboards..\n* the 14\" screen is a huge surprise coming from an 11.6\" chromebook (2.4\" is a lot!) and even the 13.3\" macbook, yet it's dimensions are only very slightly larger (<1\"). There's about an inch of empty space on both sides of the keyboard--I'm the sort of person who saw the 15\" Macbook and thought, *\"ugh, what is all that space for!?\"*, and didn't buy one until the 13\" came out. The massive OLED screen gets as close as you'd want to the edges--any closer, your fingerprints would smudge the beautiful screen when opening/closing it. As does the massive trackpad.\n* the bigger touchpad may cause more accidents. I haven't had enough experience, but thus far, it seems fine for my hands, for the most part. I did have had it click on random parts of this review i'm writing quite a few times.. but then again, i'm currently sitting at a bad angle. UPDATE: i love it. bigger is better. i must have gotten used to it, as i don't accidentally touch it anymore..\n* the ports are perfect for me, as i'm not updated on current technology: two thunderbolt(?, new to me), two usb--one on each side!!!, one hmdi, a headphone jack, an sd card reader, and a good ol' kensington lock, lol. I've never used a lock before, but have always found it intriguing . I feel the port choices are very old-school, like me. :) It might be possible for 4 displays for this chip...!? (note: smaller 13.3\" laptops can compromise on ports)\n* bloatware. after 20 years, this still exists. Why? McAfee still exists..?? I did however use the 1 year of 100GB dropbox. Could someone please ship me a usb flash drive or sd card so that i can re-install windows? ;(\n\nwith all the similar \"ultrabooks\" (Asus zenbook, Lenovo yoga, HP spectre, Dell xps 14, maybe even the lower-end Acer spin, Asus flipbook, Asus vivobook, HP pavilion plus, Dell inspiron plus, 'n so on), i felt it's pretty hard to decide on one, and just went with what good deals i found on eBay, and checked the review on notebookcheck, and double-checked that the specs are indeed \"ultra\" (weight, size, build quality--not plastic).\n\nit's direct local (to Taiwan) competition is the asus zenbook, and i actually think that's a better notebook. Better speakers, better keyboard (i prefer big keys over the macbook chiclet-style), betters looks (premium business ultrabook vs macbook clone), lighter (an insane 1.3kg), and most importantly a better battery (75w vs 65w, 12+ hours vs 8 in tests!), but, notebookcheck's review noted a fan noise problem, due to it having a single fan / heat-sink vs this Acer's double fan 'n heat-sink. The problem could just be a fluke, but def worth researching other users experiences about it. Beyond that single problem though, i def prefer the zenbook. However, if a macbook clone is what you're really into, this Acer is just that!: a 14\" Macbook Pro (possibly for half the price due to bad resale value)\n\ni personally chose the Intel ultra series for it's great games/power balance, and x64 architecture. I missed out on the entire AMD marathon. An older asus rog flow x13 (g14 doesn't have touch-screen), razer blade 14, or microsoft surface pro (intel ultra series, not the newer ARM arch models) would have been my top choices, if i were to accept something more used. The previous gen surfaces were way too expensive! But i'm super stoked with what i got for $550. Wow! Also, i love Taiwan (made in Taiwan <3), so Acer 'n Asus were actually my top choices (they do all the hard work of making everything, and are absolutely lovely people with an incredible culture to behold, so let them have all my monies!). Actually, i've been fond of the swift series laptops, particularly swift 3 series and 5 series, ever since that time i went to a physical store to test 'n compare laptops. They were by far the best deals in the \"budget\" range. They were all ultrabooks in my eyes, for a fraction of the price of one.\n\nthe OLED is stunning. Now there's absolutely no need for a Macbook for me. My last one was a late-201313\" MBP. Hello again, Windows. How i've missed you dearly. And oh my, how you've accepted Linux..?? I don't even need Linux anymore, and that's coming from Arch! Also, having done some programming, i can't justify the sufferings that Apple has made programmers go through over its reign. Microsoft has since made a big turn towards accepting open-source, linux, programmers, etc. Strange, but good... i hope.\n\nfor my personal needs, the lower-resolution IPS touch-screen would've been ideal, for both touch input and possibly better gaming performance (*does native resolution matter nowadays..?*). It is indeed a major bummer. However, i feel that without the the ability to swivel the screen around (\"convertible\"), it would've made an odd touch-screen experience anyway, quite different from tablets. Also very important to note, **there's quite a few touch-screen OLED notebooks--**[**including the zenbook**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/13wdvxm/oled_touchscreen_is_awful/)**--, that suffer from a grainy screen problem**--though, i don't know which exact models / year have this problem. So, in the end, i feel it was more of a blessing. Anyway, i'm hoping my next job will pay for a premium laptop. At the moment, if money were not a factor, i'd go for either the Asus rog flow x13 or dreamy z13. The z13 is all i've ever dreamed for, ever since the iPad came out. ;) ...but i've read that even the z13 suffers from a very low battery life. :/\n\nUPDATE: now that i've got OLED, i can't imagine ever going back.. o.o\n\nso, if i were to choose again, a \"new\" 2022 asus rog flow x13 ryzen 7940HS would have been my choice, and very very surprisingly, it's going for a mere \\~$800!! So, unless you find a deal like mine, you should just go for one of the best out there! Otherwise, this is an incredibly solid laptop for its price. It has also easily convinced me macbooks aren't worth it anymore, as it was a decade ago, even considering the newer ARM M-series. I'm a believer of Acer/Asus/Taiwan!",
  "Is the fan noise not that big of a deal? I plan to buy this same model, and will be using this inside my university's computer laboratory. And I don't want to distract others with the fan noise.",
  "I bought my Acer Swift Go 14 on September 28, featuring an Ultra 5 125H processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and a 90Hz OLED HDR display running Windows 11 (23H2). I got it for 60,000 INR after discounts, down from around 80K. My previous laptop was the ASUS FX504, which I used for 6 years.\n\n# Negatives:\n\n* Wi-Fi Speeds & Performance: The ASUS consistently outperforms the Acer in download speeds, and I occasionally feel a static sensation when touching the metal surface while charging.\n* Sharp Trackpad Edge & Heat During Charging: The trackpad edge is uncomfortable, and the right side gets hot while charging, making it tough to use on my lap.\n* Useless Copilot Key & Keyboard Backlight: I remapped the Copilot key to Ctrl using AutoHotKey, but the keyboard backlight turns off too quickly, which is frustrating.\n* AI Features & Webcam: The AI eye contact feature is poorly executed, and the wide-angle webcam captures too much of my surroundings.\n* Glossy Display: It's highly reflective, which isn't ideal for bright environments.\n\n# Positives:\n\n* Stunning Design & Trackpad: The laptop looks sleek, almost like a MacBook, and the massive trackpad is so good that I hardly use a mouse.\n* Solid Hinge & Great Keyboard: The hinge is easy to open with one hand and feels premium, while the keyboard is clicky and visually appealing.\n* Outstanding Display: It's bright and colorful, with excellent HDR for movies.\n* Useful AI Features & Decent Speakers: The AI background blurring and noise cancellation work well, and the speakers are good for a laptop.\n* Convenient Charging & Good I/O: I can use my phone's USB-C charger, and there are multiple USB ports and useful features.\n\n# Performance:\n\nWhile I haven't tested it with games or benchmarks yet, the Acer is significantly faster than my ASUS for everyday tasks. It handles multiple apps smoothly, even on battery.\n\n# Battery Life:\n\nYou can't expect stellar battery life with a high-resolution H-series processor. I got around 5 hours of SOT with regular use and 4 hours while looping a 4K movie. There are ways to extend battery life, but I prefer using it to its full potential since it stays on my desk most of the time.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nFor the price I paid, I believe I found the best laptop for my needs. I'm very satisfied overall. **For the full review, check out my post** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcerOfficial/comments/1g75rhv/new_acer_swift_go_14_ai_pcs_review/).

  " how's it now?\nI have to keep charging since i will be using this laptop throughout the day. \nSo will you still recommend me i  buy this? Heard,  it heats a lot while charging. This laptop is perfect for me, except thermal issues..",
  "Im so glad for your write-up. I have an Acer Swift Go (Ultra 7 155H) and reinstalled windows too. I had trouble with the installation not finding my SSD so I had to fiddle around, in my case I installed a Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver during windows installation, I hope Ive known about the VMD setting but I couldnt find it in BIOS, the hidden setting tip woudlve been a lifesaver.\n\nFor the drivers, did you remove the acer included ones or did you let it stay in your system? particularly useful is acer care center for 80% battery charge limit and touchpad light control, other than that all of it were junk.\n\nedit:  \nlist of acer default apps\n\nAcersense - useful for battery limit to 80%, touchpad light brigtness and some stuff. Manufacturer-bound, cant change in windows so dont delete this. Just dl from product support on acer website just type the SFG14-73 ​  \n  \nAcer QuickPanel - Garbage. Features; Pureview - just open in settings>bluetooth>camera for things. PureVoice - some mic/recording related features essentially its just realtek audio console so delete this garbage its just essential features just repackage by acer   \n  \n​Acerliveart - Garbage.

  "yikes... i dunno.. i've mostly been using it for simple web browsing.. I usually just have chrome with a billion tabs open (chrome seems smarter nowadays..), spotify, a bunch of terminals, and visual studio code. The only time the fan will come on, which is how i'm informed the cpu is working hard, is if i jump through many chrome tabs, or, is if some extension in vs-code has a bug / is poorly programmed. I haven't got into games yet, but i'd expect it to kill my battery.\n\nalso i think i had battery saving mode set to on when unplugged... but i really  love the transparent windows which lead into the deep deep photos of the world in the background... so i may have to turn that off as well. :/\n\ni'd say try ..chrome? i haven't gotten deep into removing all the crap that microsoft runs in the back yet...\n\n\\`winget/scoop install ungoogled-chromium\\`",
  "Heya, I'm looking at a similar laptop model but with Ultra Core 9 185H.\n\nHow's your current experience with the Swift 14 GO? Is the battery life still abysmal and fan noise? Thanks!",
  "i personally wish i had touch-screen, as i've literally lived off an ipad mini 2 for a long long time, and anything without a touch-screen seems ancient to me... heck, using a laptop feels ancient! but the OLED is kinda amazing.. ;) i don't feel i can make that judgement for you. maybe you can find a local store to physically see the equivalent of both resolutions/screens, and then decide..?\n\notherwise, i've been loving this little laptop. absolutely zero regrets, zero problems. super quiet. charges fast. love the keyboard and trackpad, which is something i'm usually super picky about..",

  "MBA!.. if liked Apple.\n\nMacBooks still are luxury, unless something major happened, lol. A Macbooks’s screen, keyboard, touch pad, micorophone, web cam, all those details are just guaranteed to be top notch. You just don’t have to worry about anything. And most of all it will have insane, best-in-class battery life.\n\njust do a little research to see if there’s something wrong with the model, otherwise, get it!\n\nThe only reason to go for a windows laptop is for a proper gaming laptop, because Apple doesn’t care about games: gamers nor game developers (nor software developers for that matter). Oh also, if you actually need to use windows, i’m not sure if windows even runs on ARM..?? (see link). And what about all those games/apps made for x64 or even older 32-bit? You’d have to research into Mac’s emulation. I would hope the x64 emulation is good, as it takes time to transition cpu architectures.. I personally just wouldn’t want to bother with all of this, so it better be dang good! The intel Macs was a good time imo, having Mac and windows run natively via boot camp. ARM, i have no idea. I haven’t bought a computer in a decade! lol. But that’s the reason I didn’t even bother with the surface pro with ARM (Snapdragon). The whole thing reminds me of proprietary charging cables. It’s not, but that’s how it feels.\n\nBut do note, I have two very strong biases: as a childhood gamer turned game maker, and having at one time the horrific experience of using objective-c and Xcode to make a game for iPad, I value being able to play games (and apps) and not adding more complexity to making games (and apps). Forcing people to buy a Mac product just to deploy to it is insane to me (though surely there’s a service for that now..). Adding restrictions such as which programming language you can use (no JIT, meanwhile Android runs on JVM..). I’ll take the messes that are windows and android/linux any-day. I don’t even know if OpenGL supports ARM. Ooooh, what a mess. ;(\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/t44vqc/comment/i0kcxy2/",

  "How is it for running vsc? I'd get a version with Ryzen 7 and use it for coding (vsc, codeblocks, eclipse), running a virtual machine, some simpler video editing and usual internet surfing.

  "there is no fan noise when unplugged. it starts when charging the laptop or when doing something intensive. unfortunately i can't compare to other laptops because it's been so long... i can't even recall if my old macbook (2013) even had fan noise...?? but it distinctly starts up, runs a bit, stops upon starting certain applications. i have speakers near where i charge it, so i don't pay much attention there, but it does make noise charging.\n\ni personally have no gripes with it. i love it.\n\nnot sure how much worse the battery will be with ultra core 9 tho..",

  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",

  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still.

When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",

  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget €2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years. As longevity is important, I believe performance is an important criteria. My current setup is an 8th gen Intel i5 Asus laptop (8/256) and a M4 Mac Mini (24/512) on the desk. I want to replace both of these items with a single Windows laptop and I'll sell the Mac. I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around €2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. €1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. €1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. €1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. €2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. €2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** €2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",
  "Have you ruled out Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024 or 2025)? It is a cheaper Asus ProArt with the same of internals.  These Asus model carry the best speakers of all Windows laptops which is nice to have if you have kids or others to share a screen.",
  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",

  "Also, unlike the ProArt you don't need to pay for a 4070 you said you wouldn't be using much. The 16:10 screen is also good for web development with it's bit of extra height. P1's are also pretty much the top of the Thinkpad scale, being workstation laptops and thus very solid. P1 gen 7 is also 17mm thick and 2kg so pretty portable.",

  "Confused about which laptop to buy Hi everyone\n\nI am an engineering grad student and I want to buy a windows laptop for my work ( mostly ). but I keep getting more confused about which laptop to buy. My first choice was the Asus Zenbook 14, which I read multiple negative reviews of it's bad performance and some motherboard issues. My other candidate was some Lenovo Thinkpad Carbon( which is expensive ) Thinkpad P or T series, or Yoga 7i, which I read they also have some quality issues as the are made in China ( I just read the reviews, I never had a lenovo before). Then I found HP x360 2024 amazing due to its portability and use of newest gen of Intel chip, and guess what? when I searched its name, there was an essay of why these specific HP laptops are bad and have issues ( the post was from someone who claimed to be a former HP tech guy).\n\nIn conclusion, I want to buy a Laptop which is \n\n1. portable ( I have to carry it around everywhere, so the charger brick's weight also counts)\n2. Have good performance ( I use softwares for rendering and calculation, like heavy matlab tasks), so the RAM is also important. ( having the option to upgrade the device would be great )\n3. I am a bit concerned about the PWM of displays and it made me hesitate about buying an OLED panel )\n4. The battery life is also a thing, but not as important as the fan noise ( imagine being in a meeting and your laptop is louder than your supervisor )\n5. I have zero to no knowledge about the integrated graphics, but I heard the for an OLED panel its better to have a dedicated graphics. also for rendering I think dedicated graphics are better as you can assign a task to specific GPU core.\n\nRight now I am using an old Asus ROG from 6 years ago, and Its finally the time for retiring the old soldier.\n\nMy candidates for laptops are as mentioned:\n\n1. HP specter x360 (2024)\n2. Ideapad pro 5i\n3. Asus Zenbook 14 or 14pro\n4. Lenovo Yoga 7i (2024)\n5. Asus Zypherus g14 (2024 or 2023, I still don't know)\n6. Asus Vivobook ( not really sure about the build quality of them )\n\nPlease let me know if I missed any good laptops. Thank you in advance for your time.

I had a MacBook pro 13\" 2018 no touch bar since last August which I was pretty happy with but, a series of unfortunate events ended in me having to sell it for parts due to an accident that couldn't be fixed. I am still in quite a lot of debt for this laptop and have been looking for a cheaper replacement that can fulfill my needs. I am a recent design graduate and require a laptop that will be able to run photoshop and indesign smoothly (light/medium use) for my illustration work.\n\nYesterday I bought a Lenovo 330s from John Lewis after having spent hours looking at other laptops and considering more expensive options (like the Lenovo Yoga), I settled on the 330 because the screen resolution looked good, the build felt decent and the specs seemed promising.

(Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i good choice for programmer / light gaming student? Hello all.

  "So which one you end up buying?",
  "Is Lenovo IdeaPad pro 5 a good laptop ? So, I am a cse major and I want to buy a laptop, I researched and came across Lenovo IdeaPad pro 5 gen 10. I chose this because it has a good screen, good battery life and decent build quality as I've heard.\n\nMy use case is just jetbrains ides, vs code and lots of chrome tabs. I usually use my laptop 6-8 hours a day. \n\nSo, is this a good a laptop ? or should I look for something else ? ",
  "https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxParadigm/s/ZpjTDEulmn\n\nThis is my review of the laptop",
  "How is it working now ? Any issues ?",
  "Its pretty good there is nothing that i would find missing that would make me want to upgrade to a more expensive laptop as:\n\nThe screen is 3K OLED 120hz so its as good as it gets and looks gorgeous irl The brightness is crazy good and HDR videos look awesome (this screen is so good that I cannot get myself to use a monitor cuz it feels far worse lol)\n\nThe performance is very good and beats the Ultra 9 185H in performance while staying very cool so i didnt feel like it was worth spending much more for Ultra 7 or Ultra 9 (cooling becomes a bottleneck and thus this wouldn't yield much higher performance too)\n\n32gb ram is plenty so i can run multiple coding software  while also playing music/videos easily (20 tabs too) This ram is also very fast (fastest in the segment) \n\nGaming performance/GPU: its pretty good as you can play GTA V and games like it at decent fps (40 to 45 on 3K and 90 on 1080p) and newer games like AC Mirage and Marvel Rivals have XESS Frame gen to help.. Although the arc 140T on Ultra 7 or Ultra 9 is superior its not a deal breaker \n\nBuild Quality: Pretty solid its full aluminium with a good amount of ports and 2 fans which keep it cool and when doing regular tasks on battery saver the fans don't even turn on so it feels like an m4 macbook \n\nBattery life: 10+ hours on battery saver (for coding/ media consumption) and 5 to 6 hours on auto while getting 2hrs on high performance tasks (gaming/video editing) This is for 3K resolution and variable refresh rate \n\nSpeakers: pretty mid and doesn't get loud (depends on the video) so unless im in a quiet room i use headphones",
  "I also like my lenovo purchase. Got the 2025 model with the 285H and 32Gb and all is ok except the speakers. I would decently rank them low to very low. I think they sound worse then the speakers of an A range samsung A50-A55 they all sound about the same. Imagine that a Samsung S23 - S25 has better bass. The speakers are good only to listen the words from any youtube review/tutorial, news etc. Any form of music will sound horrific, no matter how you would try to tune the settings and that is truly shameful cause all other things are very good for the money i have paid. \n\nPro: Full metal, oled, large battery for a 14inch, good cooling with dual fans, extra ssd slot (got 3tb on mine), hinge that goes 160\n\nCons: Speakers are HORRIBLE",
  "thankyou for this detailed info. Did you order from the lenovo site ? If yes, if i order from the site, is there anything i should keep in mind to get great deals or just in general ? Also why Intel and not ryzen ?",
  "Yo can you tell me about the power limits for CPU + iGPU on this laptop?",
  "Can you give more info about gaming ?? ( you are talking about ultra 5 225 H right?)",
  "Yes I ordered from their website (India) and i applied Sheer id student discount, Unidays 5% cto discount and EXTRASAVINGS along with with a 5% credit card cashback and 3% affiliate cashback from u/unboxparadigm \nI also removed 3 years adp which was 4k inr and added 1 year adp which was 1 inr and thus i brought the price for 1TB 32gb ram version from 92k to 76k inr\n\nI chose intel as Ryzen AI 5 and 7 are just rebadged versions of last gen with an NPU and although an NPU might be useful to get copilot plus features such as recall I don't want to sacrifice performance for a feature I may use (yes the ultra 5 225H beats the Ryzen ai 7 350) \nBut if you have the budget for Ryzen ai 9 hx 370 definitely go for it as it is more powerful than Ultra 5 and Ultra 7 while using much much less power thus giving you a substantially better battery life while doing high performance tasks",

  "ASUS VivoBook Pro 15 vs Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i? (Both OLED) Which is the best overall laptop for heavy digital media usage for college? FYI I’ve been on team Lenovo for quite a while however I want to know whether I should stick with Lenovo or try something new such as the ASUS VivoBook 15 Pro OLED. Specs are shown in the three pictures. Wanting to try ASUS for quite a while however I’m not sure if it’s worth switching from that from Lenovo. Just want to try something new.\n\nSorry for the repost. Have to remove my shipping zip code and city for safety purposes.",
  "i’m from the uk so i have a slightly different spec to the vivobook (4060 and 16GB of ram the rest is the same) the keyboard and the screen are lovely, i’ve never had an issue with performance, i game a fair amount on it and it handles it well. I will say, the moment you do anything like gaming, it turns into a jet engine it can be unbearable but performs very well, and it has meh battery life (which makes sense since the screen and cpu is power hungry) speaking of it does run quite hot unless if you place it on a table. Long story short get the lenovo it might not seem like it but the specs are better, the new gen cpu is much more power efficient and a new gen gpu is always a good thing, you will probably still have an issue with cooling such a thin laptop",
  "Planning to buy a lenovo ideapad 3 slim ryzen 7 5000 series, laptop Thoughts in this? \n\nFull specs in the pic\n\nSomehow I can't find any reviews on this specific model.

Will use this 4 years minimum. \n\nIn general, can anyone who uses/used lenovo ideapad 3 (any models, or this in particular) share their experience and if there are any issues? any reviews or feedbacks? 🙏\n\nQuestions:\n- Can this last for 4 years? \n- How many hours does battery last based on ur experience? \n- Any heating issues? Is it recommended to buy a cooling pad right away? \n- Can it handle minor damages?\n\nOr if you better recommendations pls feel free to do so.

  "Lenovo bad. HP better? IdeaPad Pro 5 (8845HS) and Yoga Pro 7 (155H) vs Omnibook Ultra 14 (AI 365) Hi everyone!  \nSorry for the click-bait topic. I want to ask about buying HP over Lenovo. In order to make this post more valuable, I'll write down a short review of the Lenovo laptops because I found many people are looking for similar things in a laptop as me. Also including the OLED vs IPS opinion. I'll add 8845HS vs 155H review later.\n\nOriginally, I wrote a long post, but I didn't save it and it got lost. I'll try to make it short this time.\n\n**What am I looking for?**  \nI want a small work laptop that I could also use for my personal things. It should have good CPU, 32GB of RAM and 100% sRGB because I intend to use it for editing photos while traveling. I also wanted iGPU because it's good enough for the tasks I intend to use it for.\n\n**Why I don't want OLED**  \nOLED screen is dominant in the class of laptops I am looking at. And generally it's a selling point of many laptops. I understand why, but it's no good for my use-case.  \nI use a lot of static content Programming/Lightroom/Web and when I am working, I want to use my laptop as a second screen, which means opened browser or a VS Code for extended periods of time. Of course, this is exactly the use-case that's not great for OLEDs. I also went to a local shop and I saw that the OLED screens have a burn in. I understand that the laptops might be there for a long time, but still.. I don't want to limit my productivity to mitigate something that's going to happen sooner or later. Also the eye strain is real. So it's an IPS for me.\n\n**IdeaPad Pro 5 14AHP9**  \nThis was a big step up from ThinkPad E590 I had before. The performance is great. It's even better than 5600X I have in my PC. But I was being worried about the OLED burn in too much in the long run. Otherwise it was a perfect choice for me. \n\nPros:  \n\\- Very good specs  \n\\- Full metal case  \n\\- Good keyboard  \n\\- Good connectivity with 2 USB-C (USB-4), 2 USB-A and a SD card reader  \n\\- 85Wh battery  \n\\- **Quiet**\n\nCons:  \n\\- Very limited customizations  \n  ThrottleStop doesn't support 8845HS, you can't do much in the BIOS, you can't adjust fan curve  \n\\- OLED burn in  \n\\- 240Hz PWM\n\n**Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14IMH9**  \nI was hesitant to choose Intel because I believe AMD is better, but it has a nice IPS display and it fit my requirements perfectly.  \nI don't know if it's because of the Intel processor, but it's **loud.** Every time it get's above 60C, the fans just start spinning for some time. The CPU reaches 38C in the mean time. WHY?. And it happens even while browsing. The fans are also very high-pitched and annoying. The fan curve from Lenovo is terrible and I couldn't change it. It behaves like that in all power modes. Lenovo restricts any customization for some reason. It's very annoying and that's basically the only reason why I am looking for some other options.\n\nPros:  \n\\- IPS with 100% sRGB  \n\\- Very good specs  \n\\- Full metal case  \n\\- Good keyboard  \n\\- Thunderbolt 4  \n\\- 14.5\" display with minimal overall size change  \n\\- Good light use efficiency thanks to E-cores\n\nCons:  \n\\- Terrible fan curve (loud)  \n\\- Power button located on the side means accidental shut downs  \n\\- Only one USB-A  \n\\- Very limited customizations  \n  ThrottleStop doesn't support 8845HS, you can't do much in the BIOS, you can't adjust fan curve\n\n  \n**IdeaPad Pro 5 14AHP9 vs Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14IMH9**  \nBoth look very much the same and I really like the design. Yoga is a bit larger thanks to the 14.5\" display which is better for productivity and you can't really tell when carrying it.  \nThe build quality is better on the Yoga. It has a more premium feeling, but it's really not noticeable. The only noticeable things are the bezel around the screen is glass vs plastic on the IdeaPad. Another thing is keyboard, which is meant to feel more premium on the Yoga. It has a great travel but it's harder to press than on IdeaPad that's why I prefer the IdeaPad keyboard.\n\n**Ryzen 9 8845HS vs Intel 155H**  \nAMD is definitely more power efficient during moderate tasks. I think it's also part of the reason why IdeaPad is more quiet. \n\n**HP OmniBook Ultra 14 (AI 365)**  \nThis is an option I am looking into and I want your opinion on it. It's about 150$ more expensive, but it has a newer ZEN 5.  \nI'll share my cons and pros about this laptop. What I would really appreciate is your experience with the noise. Also if you can do more customizations like a fan curve using FanControl.\n\nPros:  \n\\- ZEN 5 (quiet?)  \n\\- IPS with 100% sRGB  \n\\- More customizability?\n\nCons:  \n\\- Worse design  \n\\- Large bezel (the laptop is the size of Yoga which has 14.5\" vs 14\")  \n\\- USB-C in the corner  \n\\- More expensive  \n\nWhat I ultimately want to achieve (and what is achievable with the IdeaPad) is that I want my laptop dead silent during some light work.\n\nI hope somebody will be able to share their experience and help me decide. I also hope I could help somebody else decide!\n\nThanks!",

  "For the price you will have to look at your countries offers and if you get some kind of discounts like student discount, that Lenovo offers. \nIs it worth it? Depends on the price and what you need. If you can find a ryzen ai 7 or core ultra 7 256v laptop with good display and the ports you need, for about the same price or 150$ more, that will be the better option. \nI'm really happy with it tho, I use it 10 hours a day for studying and gaming and battery life, display and performance are just great.

  "Asus ProArt 16 (H7606WV) review Hey everyone,\n\nI recently purchased a P16 laptop (November 2024), and I have to say, my experience so far has been pretty disappointing. I was really excited about this machine, since it was a big upgrade from my previous laptop, however it seems like I’ve run into a series of frustrating issues that I didn't even have in my previous 7 year old asus laptop. For example:\n\n1. **Lag in Standard Mode (Battery)**: When I switch to standard mode while on battery, the laptop lags significantly. It’s not just a minor delay; it’s enough to make using the laptop frustrating. I only get good perfromance when it's on the charger.\n2. **Blue Screens**: I’ve encountered 2 blue screens since I started using it. It’s random and happens at high loads such as running an LLM or an compiling an android app, which makes me worry about the reliability of the device. I'm suspecting it's something related to the ram.\n3. **Keyboard Defect**: I had to get a replacement machine shortly after purchase due to double clicking. It only happens when you type fast (100+ wpm ??). It’s frustrating to deal with hardware issues right out of the box.\n4. **Sleep/Wake Issues**: The laptop has a mind of its own when it comes to sleep mode. Sometimes it just doesn’t wake up, and I have to force a restart. I’ve checked all the devices that could potentially wake the computer and even tried diagnosing with `powercfg sleepstudy`, but nothing seems to help. And just like it doesn't wake up correctly, sometimes it doesn't go to sleep as well. I understand this is an windows issue because of the sleep 0, sleep 1, etc, however still a problem!\n\nIt feels like asus didn't really test throughout before releasing this product.",

  "Review of Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 (15in, 16gb, 512gb SSD, AMD Ryzen 5700u) I bought the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 (15in, 16gb, 512gb SSD, AMD Ryzen 5700u) in India. Here is my review about it after using it for about 2 weeks.\n\n**Build:**\n\n* Update after 14 months (16 Oct 2022): Shit quality hinge. Broke twice till now without ever dropping the laptop.\n* Full plastic build. Metal Lid. Matte finish. Feels great and solid.\n* Keyboard and touchpad are great\n\n**General things:**\n\n1. Initially I had some problem with the speakers when they would stop working and I had to restart the laptop to fix. I got a driver update a couple days later, haven't had that same problem since.\n2. The fingerprint can be a hit or miss sometimes due to its design, I then added my fingerprint from multiple angles so mostly works but sometimes have to try again.\n3. My unit had some backlight bleed on the bottom right corner noticeable when in a dimly lit room at above 70% brightness. Not a problem for me since I dim the screen to around 30% in the dark. This will vary by laptop though.\n4. I have a problem with OBS recordings. It seems that OBS is recording at same volume as windows master volume. I haven't been able to find a fix for it. Every program I tried which captures audio from speakers to record/broadcast (OBS, XSlit, Anydesk) have the same issue.  **(EDIT: FIX: Roll Back Realtek (R) Audio drivers so that the manufacturer is Microsoft, Dolby audio will stop working though if you do it. Not recommended.)**\n5. The product description states that it has Bluetooth 5.0 but the device manager says its Bluetooth 5.1.\n\n**Expandability**:\n\nI opened mine up coz of curiosity. The internal design is the same as last years version.\n\n1. The RAM is soldered in dual channel. (Task Manager)\n2. There is one M.2 NVME SSD slot which is already populated with the 512 GB SSD.\n3. There is a space for an HDD but it doesn't come with the SATA cable installed, the SATA cable will need to be purchased separately to install a hard drive within the laptop.\n4. The laptop comes with WI-FI 5 and not WI-FI 6 unlike last years version. The WI-FI card is upgradable if you need WIFI 6.\n5. The internal battery can also be upgraded to 70 Whrs version. However note that if you do upgrade, it will occupy the HDD slot aswell.\n\nLink to Lenovo's Spare parts website of this model. [IdeaPad 5 ALC05 Type 92LN Spare parts](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/in/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/5-series/ideapad-5-15alc05/82ln/parts/display/compatible)\n\n**Battery life estimates from 100 percent battery (70% brightness):**\n\n1. Watching movies (Chrome with 5 extensions - 1 tab open, discord, telegram, anydesk, Battery saving mode active from Vantage software, Better battery saving mode in windows.) - 9hrs\n2. Moderate Multi tasking (Listening to music, actually using chrome, discord, qbittorrent (downloading) and a bunch of other background programs, Battery saving mode from Vantage software, Better battery saving mode in windows.) - 6 to 7 hrs\n\n* Note: I use my laptop on conservation mode all the time so it charges only to 60%. The battery life is based on the time it take to drain the laptop from 60% to around 30% and multiplying that by 3.\n* The conservation mode is not customizable. Its either 60% charge or 100% charge.\n* Also, I absolutely love the conservation mode, ~~no other brands have this~~ Asus and Dell also have it according to the internet. My laptop remains on the desk most of the time so I don't have to worry about it remaining on 100% all the time.\n\n**Fans (In an air conditioned room)**\n\n* On Battery- The laptop fans are completely off when watching movies. They may or may not turn on when multi tasking.\n* Plugged in- The fans only turned off when set to Battery Saving Mode in Vantage and doing light tasks.\n* Fans are inaudible (if they do turn on) when doing basic tasks in a room with air conditioner running, only slightly audible with the air conditioner off.\n\n**iGPU**:\n\n* Out of the 16gb ram, 2GB is dedicated for the iGPU, this can be changed in BIOS to 1GB or 512 MB.\n\n**Lenovo Power Management modes:**\n\n* Extreme Performance- TDP is 35 Watts.\n* Intelligent Cooling- TDP is 25 Watts.\n* Battery Saving Mode- TDP is 15 Watts.\n* On Battery, change to best performance (windows) and these modes function the same as plugged in.  I did notice that Battery Saver Mode (Vantage) turns on the fans later than the Intelligent cooling mode which is I guess nice if you're trying to save battery.\n\n**Performance Benchmarks (Plugged in)(Extreme Performance):**\n\n* **Cinnebench R23**\n   * Multi Core **-** 9655 points, 3.65 GHz across all cores, Max: 85 C, Power: 35 W\n   * Single Core **-** 1245 points, 4.3 Ghz single core, Max: 70 C, Power: 10 W\n* **Crystal DiskMark-** 2481 MB/s Read, 1726 MB/s Write\n\n**Performance Benchmarks on battery:**\n\nThe laptop can achieve full performance on battery as well, change from Better Battery mode to Best performance mode in the Windows battery settings.\n\n**Note:** On battery, Better Battery (and Battery Saver) mode locks the CPU at base clock of 1.8 Ghz to get maximum battery life. While using this mode, I did not suffer any hanging when doing casual tasks, (Web browsing, YouTube, Discord etc.)\n\nIf you wanna know something else about it. Please let me know. I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.\n\n* EDIT #1: Added Benchmarks.\n* EDIT #2: Photo of the internals. [https://imgur.com/a/5WCUKW4](https://imgur.com/a/5WCUKW4)\n   * Disassembly video from YouTube (not the exactly same model): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKF\\_9L1qfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKF_9L1qfY)\n* EDIT #3, #4: Added battery benchmarks, then deleted them because I tested them on Better battery mode which locks the clock speed to 1.8Ghz.\n* Edit #5: Cleaned up the post.\n   * Update as of 8 Sept 2021: I have been having some weird touchpad problem. [Details here](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-IdeaPad-1xx-3xx-5xx-7xx-Edge-LaVie-Z-Flex-Notebooks/Touchpad-sluggish-Latency-Lag/m-p/5095310). This has not been fixed after a touchpad replacement so currently working on it. The issue does seem isolated to just me though.\n* Edit #6: Update as of 16 Oct 2022: The hinge is shit quality, it has broken twice till now in the exact same manner with completely normal use.",
  "I can confirm that the hinge quality is garbage. I use mine almost entirely at home, after 2 years of use I have used it no more than 30 times outside. I very rarely open and close the lid when I use it at home because I can sense right from the beginning the hinge quality is not the best although I did not expect it to be this bad. And yet the hinge broke! Together with the LCD!\n\nI paid RM170 (around 39 USD) just to get the one time on site repair because they said repair at the depot would take around 2 weeks time and I had no spare laptop. The basic, send in to the depot warranty covered the spare parts, luckily. So if you guys are planning to buy this model, **do consider to upgrade to the onsite warranty to 3 or 4 years** (depending on how long you plan to use the device). \n\nThe technician who came even told me this model and the model 3 are plagued with this problem. 7 and thinkpads fair better. I wish I'd known.\n\nPerformance wise, it is amazing. Still running strong after two years. (I open many tabs on Edge daily, at times 30-50 tabs, rarely any hiccup.) i5 11 gen, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Heat management is superb as well. It heats up but never overheat, not once.\n\nCheers,  \nR.",
  "Thank you for the review! This is by far the most comprehensive one I've read about this laptop as it's just been released.\n\nI have a few questions-\n1. Do you notice a significant drop in performance (general multi tasking) when on battery vs plugged in?\n2. Does the 100% screen brightness hold up in well-lit rooms or under the sun?\n3. How was the initial set-up process like? Did you install any specific programs/drivers that helped?",
  "Thankx for the review, based on it I will no more 'struggle' with choosing a new laptop from Lenovo, I got a bit scared haha. I'm gonna carry on with my HP's. They have not failed me yet, and I have been happy with performances so far. :)",
  "**Beware: Major Touchpad Problem**\n\nI bought a Lenovo Ideapad Silm 5 laptop in Aug 23, and I thought all is well until a few months in. My touchpad stopped functioning but thankfully, the onsite warranty allowed me to change my motherboard. A few months down the road, the same issue arose, and I was told by the customer hotline to undergo numerous upgrading of software, restarting of laptop, etc, and the touchpad would mysteriously function after a months/weeks until it breaks down again. This laptop is reaching its 1 year mark, and the same issue still persists. It has been a major inconvenience, especially since a mouse cannot entirely replace the functions of the touchpad (i.e. pinching in/out to enlarge the text). To my dismay, I was told by the onsite warranty engineer that the touchpad issue is rampant in laptops of this particular model. I asked for an upgrade of my laptop or replacement of another model, but I was told that this was not Lenovo's usual practice. Am still monitoring the issue after the engineer has replaced the touchpad (for second time), but if anything, **please do not purchase this model** unless you are willing to forgo its touchpad.\n\nTrust me, their onsite warranty they provide is not worth in exchange for your sanity if you were to constantly experience the same issue. The warranty team somehow does not understand what \"intermittent issue\" mean, and they'll put you through the arduous process of troubleshooting and restarting, only for you to find yourself back to square one.\n\nP.S. My USB ports were also not working, but it's fixed atm.",
  "hey, nice review, i bought same laptop and it seems windows media player is lagging, like not working. it's playing like 1 sec of 1min video and it takes ages to load, i tried rebooting or reinstalling from settings but keeps doing same thing, i cant play audio nor video with media playyer, so now i am using vlc media player, any1 have a fix for that?",
  "Why, kind sir, did you decide on the 15 in version instead of the 14 in? Was there any other reason than personal preference?",
  "Omg, Thank You soo much for posting this review!!\n\n\nI am unable to decide between this Ideapad and the Legion 5 with 4600H as both are very similarly priced. \n\nCould you tell me what price did you buy this at? Cause right now, it is 68k INR. And is it worth the price?\n\n\nHow is the cooling on this laptop? Does it heat up under medium-heavy loads? Especially without air conditioning.\n\n\nDoes it stutter or lag a bit when you launch an app or open a web browser or type? Especially when on battery?\n\n\n\nI tried the Intel model for the Ideapad which apparently uses the same body and parts as the Ryzen 5700U model. I did not find the keyboard and the touchpad as good as I was expecting (but I could be wrong cause I only tried it for a few seconds). \n\n\nIs the battery replaceable/ easily removeable by the user? Or does one have to take it to a service center?\n\nI was also considering the HP laptops with Ryzen 5500U but the 15in (my preferred screen size) has a TN panel while the 14in does have IPS but is glossy (I need antiglare so it doesn't strain my eyes).\n\n\nThe Ideapad 5 and Legion 5 just seem so much better.",
  "Hey OP, can you tell me how much did it cost(INR) and where did you bought it from? Good review BTW!",
  "Bro did you figure out what's the part no for the sata kit? To add sata drive?",
  "Hey OP, where were you able to purchase this from? I'm looking for an offline store to pick it up but just can't find it anywhere. \n\nAlso, now that it's been like 70 days since the post, how's the laptop holding up? I'm really looking forward to picking this up and it seems to be the best at this price point",
  "Hey OP, can you post your battery performance report  over here ?",
  "Hi OP thanks for the review! \n\nHowever I have one doubt (please forgive if it is silly), can we add a sata SSD instead of HDD in the HDD slot?",
  "Is it advisable to buy this laptop now or has similar equally priced new laptops have been released?\n Thanks for the detailed review though",
  "Valuable information my friend, I have a similar laptop but the Pro series. Would I see a major difference in battery drain and temperature, if I turn on Extreme Performance in BIOS but Balanced mode on Windows?\n\nAlso, does it make any sense to do this for gaming purposes? Because if you're going to play while the system is AC wired the TDP would be higher than 25W anyways, am I right?",

  "Thanks for the updates, especially on the hinge issue.",
  "I have a two-months-old Ideapad 5 15ABA7 which has exactly the same design as previous model and I'm worried about the hinge even though it comes with 3yr warranty",
  "Hi,\n\n1. The performance drop is not noticeable doing casual tasks on battery vs plugged in. Tried loading web pages and video playback. 4k60fps video playback is smooth on both. \n2. 100% screen brightness definitely holds up in a well lit room, I cam easily manage at 70% brightness in my room. This is probably the best you'll get in this price range, most competition only offer 250 nit screens while this is a 300 nit screen.\n3. Set-up process is pretty classic for windows. The only bloatware was McAfee which I promptly uninstalled. I found once that Lenovo Voice assistant was using 50% of the CPU (it may be updating), so uninstalled that as well. As for driver updates, Lenovo Vantage software is great, check for system updates and install the updated audio drivers from there.",
  "Please check EDIT #4, there was an error in performance test on battery.",
  "I didn't really have a preference, absolutely wanted to get 16GBs of RAM but the 14 inch version only offers 8Gb of soldered memory. There is only a 200g difference between the two, so didn't make a difference.\n\nPlus the extra HDD slot might be a nice benefit in the future.",

  "Yes SATA SSD can be used as well. Internal Sata cable doesn't come pre-installed. You'll need to go to service center to purchase and get it installed.",
  "IdeaPad 5 is still a good option for 68k. \n\nApart from this, Asus K15 Oled with 5500U, 8GB seems like a sweet deal at 58k on Flipkart during sale. Downsides would be 8Gb of RAM and a 42Whr battery. The ram is expandable to maximum of 12 or 16 gb idk. If you can look past the smaller battery, it has a freaking Oled. You might be able to get some extra battery life by using dark mode because of the Oled display.",
  "No need to go into BIOS to change performance mode, you can just change them from within windows with Lenovo Vantage. Or press Fn+Q\n\n***About the second question:-***      \nWhile AC is connected windows power modes don't really do much so you can ignore them. Between the three windows power modes there is very little difference in terms of CPU power usage (maybe 1W difference between each mode).\n\nBIOS performance modes behave exactly the same both on battery and AC. Which means TDP limits will be the same on both AC and battery. Which means if the game demands more than 25W sustained power, Intelligent cooling mode will limit performance.\n\n***About the first question:***\n\n**Under low load:-**   \nThe difference in battery life will only be caused by the fact that extreme performance mode likes to enable the fans even under very light load.\n\n**Under moderate load:-**    \nThere should be no difference for battery life and heat output in between the different BIOS power modes or windows power modes.\n\nThe reason why low and moderate load don't cause significant differences in battery life between the different power modes because the CPU only uses as much power as it needs, it is not going to consume more power if the program itself doesn't require it.\n\n**For heavy load:**\n\n**If using better battery mode (windows):**    \nThere should again be no difference in between any of the BIOS power modes.\n\n**If using better performance or best performance mode (windows):**     \nThere will be lesser battery life and greater heat output in Intelligent cooling mode compared to Battery saving mode. The difference would be greater in Extreme performance mode. However, you will also be getting better performance.",

  "Neither. Look for one without a discrete GPU if you don't plan to game on it or get into ai/ml modeling. It makes the laptop larger/heavier and uses up more battery. The integrated GPUs on modern processors have come a long way and should be sufficient for light graphics (eg photoshop, video editing) work you might do.\n\nAs for the i7 vs i9 thing, Im having the same internal debate. One would expect the i9 to outperform the i7 but i9 chips also tend to be more power hungry and run hotter. So an i9 chip will probably use up more battery or be throttled if cooling isn't sufficient.\n\n\nAlso before you buy an OLED laptop, go to your local store and see if you can find demo models for the the laptops you're considering. Im deadset on one bc they are gorgeous but they also all come with glossy screens. So if they can't get bright enough, it may limit how much you can use them in bright environments without horrible glare. Also text rendering is garbage on some Oled laptops so it's another thing to try out in person before you commit",

  "Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro 16\" Review (Comparing to Dell/HP/Samsung) My old HP Envy broke so I purchased 3 consecutive laptops and returned them all. The new HP Envy screen made my eyes hurt, the dell Inspiron 16 had really odd sounding speakers and shut down randomly even after re-installing windows, and the Samsung Galaxy Pro Book was sleek and well built but the screen was very pixelated. All where Ryzen 7 besides the Galaxy which was i7\n\nThe fourth laptop I tried was the  Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro 16\" QHD Laptop with AMD Core Ryzen 5 5600H / 8GB RAM. I got it on sale for $500 and thought it would be very basic.\n\n1. The build is awesome and has the best keyboard out of all 4 laptops I've tried. Sleek and seems light but sturdy.\n2. Sounds is great and features like face-scan sign in are appreciated.\n3. Start up time is fast fast fast\n4. Also, I accidentally put a lot of my weight on the screen (laptop was shut) when trying to kill a bug on the wall and the screen survived no blemishes.\n\nCon:\n\n1. Matte screen is not super appealing but the more I use it the more I don't mind a matte screen at this price range.\n2. I would not want to pay $900 for this but if you can get it under $600 thats a real deal.\n\nThis is my first Lenovo and I am impressed so far, for $500 total paid this is an A+.",
  "I own the newer model of this with a Ryzen 6800HS RTX3050 and 16/512GB that I got for $1100 and I like it a lot. There is also a Ryzen 6600HS RTX3050 16/512GB for $840. An Intel 11300H MX450 8/512GB model for $530.\n\nThey all have the same display and build quality and its a pretty solid line up to pick out how much horsepower you need in this budget friendly yet premium design.",

  "Hi, sorry to bother you again, but I bought that laptop as well and I am facing an issue sometimes... when i close the lid and open it after a while, sometimes I can't wake it up. Have you encountered something like that?   \nSeems like a software issue to me, but I don't really want to reinstall it after I signed up into everything and so on :D",

  "Thermals are good since the wattages are low. It’s like 35W CPU and 55W GPU or something like that. Fan noise and surface temps are also good. Cooler and quieter than my brothers G14 but then again his laptop pumps way more wattage to the components.",
  "How about [Ideapad 5 Pro](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-500/ideapad-5-pro-gen-7-(14-inch-amd)/len101i0057) for $850 vs M1 Mac Air with (16+256) for $1,137 and a $150 gift card?\n\nI'm going to use it for my research tasks for example using three browsers and keeping at least 15 tabs in each of them open simultaneously and running one word processor that's it\n\nI can deal with external storage without any issues. What would be the actual battery backup of the 6600HS version? My primary requirement is longevity, that it should at least survive my multiple browser tabs for 5 to 6 years. I have been using one IdeaPad 330S 14\" by Lenovo with 8 GB of RAM and 512 SSD, with one TB hard drive and extremely poor battery life that is for 3.5 hours and I've been using it for a 3 year and 8 months. Do you think if I do not take Apple Care Plus then I should not be touching Mac and I would be better off with one Windows device?\n\nI don't use any Apple products. Fixing Apple with out of pocket is surely scary! But, I just can't find a Windows alternative with similar battery life. While Apple is asking significantly more money for less RAM and storage, but yes I understand that there are things beyond RAM & SSD for which they are doing it. I have been used to cheap Windows machines so much that I am pretty reluctant to pay 850 for a Windows machine. I am building this argument in my head that if I am going to pay above 850, then it shouldn't be a Windows machine. But, then comes the back and forth discussion on what are you getting for your money actually! It is frustrating! I still can't decide.",
  "Yes disable the smart face detection features. In Lenovo Vantage there’s a thing that will automatically sleep when you walk away and auto wake when you come back. It does this by looking from the IR camera. I found turning this off fixes the lid sleep wake issue.",
  "Got it, that’s what I meant sorry. How do you like the matte finish versus the newer shiny alternatives it looks a little retro but I guess it’s easier on the eyes.",
  "Great, thanks! And the battery life? In specs is usually around 9h, but I didn't find any review in English so...",
  "Battery life will be better on the mac and the 16GB RAM will go farther in MacOS than in Windows. The Pro 14 probably gets around 10 hours real world use depending on what you're doing but the M1 Air gets like 15 hours real world use.\n\nMacOS is more efficient with RAM and swap so a 16GB M1 Air will feel more like 24GB in Windows. That is the major downside to the Ideapad Pro line is the soldered RAM. I got 16GB soldered and I am fully aware of the RAM limitation in Windows, and I am fully prepared to run Linux in a few years if I need my RAM to be used more efficiently.\n\nHonestly the only reason I got the Ideapad Pro 16 over a Mac was 1. I like to game while I'm traveling and 2. I wanted a bigger screen. The only big laptop Apple offers is insanely expensive. I get like 80% of the experience for half the cost. But the Ideapad Pro 14 vs the MBA 13, you don't really lose much with the MBA in terms of screen real estate, but you gain so much in battery life and RAM utilization without paying twice as much.\n\nDo you live near a micro center? If so, check if they have any more of these refurb Ideapad Pro 14 in stock. This is a killer deal for $500 for almost the exact same laptop just with a 5600U from last year instead. https://www.microcenter.com/product/648423/lenovo-ideapad-5-pro-14-laptop-computer-refurbished-grey",
  "Great, thanks.\r  \n\r  \nI found these features very interesting, but it makes sense it causes problems. Turned them off, will see tomorrow. \r  \n\r  \nBut so far, great laptop for that price, only 32GB RAM could come handy sometimes. :D",

  "This is extremely helpful. Even if I pay around $1140 (for M1 Air 16+256GB) i.e. $250 more (not counting the $150 gift card) than IdeaPad 5 Pro (16+1TB) it would be a good investment, right (even if I am not into the Apple ecosystem)? Again, my priorities are longevity, and good real world use. I am a grad student from literary background, so research and writing is what I do. No gaming or using intense softwares at all!\n\nI am scared to use any refurbished product unless it is a personal source or something like that. Would it still be wise to think about the refurbished one from micro center? I mean the price is really good! Just have to be lucky to not run into troubles.",

  "Wow, that's great, thanks.",
  "I would say the M1 Air is worth the investment especially for just reading and writing. I’m a scientist and spent most of my PhD reading and writing papers too. If not for gaming, I too would enjoy an M1 Mac. My wife has one. Real world experience is just flawless.\n\nIf you are on a budget though and that micro center option is available I would go and check it out. It’s a Lenovo refurb so it’s from the factory, micro center is just the store front. MC has some of the greatest customer service in the world so if you’re at all interested just go in and ask them about it. Since it’s a factory refurb it likely has a warranty on it.",
  "Get an LG Gram.",

  "After a while I have to say that it still doesn't work as It should.   \nI put it in sleep mode manualy from Windows start, close the lid and the next day I can't wake it up again - but It might be because it still drains battery and in Windows I see \"Screen on 11h\" as the battery drains almost 10%/hour even though it should be in sleep.   \nTried clean install but the issue still continues.\n\nIdk, I will prolly try to contact Lenovo if I won't fix it today, cause it might be hw issue... great.",

I work at rooms with 4-5 people and mostly at library, no noise at all! The keyboard is a Lenovo chicklet, so sort of standard if you have used Lenovo ideapad series before. No lag till now for my work flow (CPU 30-60%, MEM 50-70%). I don't game, so can't comment on the graphics. Build quality is on the premium side.

  "IdeaPad 5 Pro First Impression (AMD 8845HS + RTX 3050 + 18 GB RAM) I just bought my new idepad 5 pro laptop for master's study 3 weeks ago and has been using it constantly now. The criteria I was looking for was a thin and small size for mobility, has a good battery life for uni and work, but need to have a good spec for light gaming (preferably has an dedicated GPU). I did my research for 2 weeks before deciding to buy this laptop. In short, it is perfect for an all-rounder laptop.\n\n1. Mobility: it is 14 inch and only weight 1.45 kg, so good enough for me.\n2. Battery life: it is amazing how this laptop can achieve 6-9 hours despite having a dedicated GPU (many people will find this not long enough, but i persoanlly think it's good enough considering this laptop has a dGPU). I use the BIOS to turn off the dGPU and switch to iGPU-only whenever I don't use it to save power, and so far it has worked very well.\n3. Spec: The laptop feels powerful enough for light gaming, I got 120 FPS playing dota 2 at medium settings and a modern RTS game (can't really say the name here as I am under NDA for beta program) at 50-60 FPS (this is mostly irrelevant as the game is still a work-in-progress and even 4090 can only get 40 FPS at Ultra settings). For work, the performance is quite obvious. Haven't really used it for other stuff beside gaming and doing light task like internet scrolling, chatting, word, and stuff like that.\n\nIt's not a suitable laptop if you want to focus on playing games, or just do work for 12 hours a day, or want to be extra mobile, but it's a perfect one if you want to find an all-rounder and willing to take the tradeoff.",

  "Hi, hope its not too late to reply. Yes, its quite lightweight, only 1.5 kg and very small. Im currently living in netherlands and i bike 26 km per day for 3 days a week, never had any problem with my back or shoulders.\n\nFor the fan, it depends on your usage. I usually go extreme battery saving mode (completely turn off dedicated graphics via bios, lenovo vantage battery saving + windows battery saving), and there is practically no noise at all. During gaming, however (when i set the laptop to extreme performance), it does make some noise but never loud enough to bother me.\n\nAdditional info: in battery saving mode with normal ms office & spotify & chrome, it can last 9 hours at 80%, not sure how it will if charged to 100% since ive never fully charge it.",

  "The cpu's (according to benchmarks) are almost identical in performance. The ultra 5 will have a much better igpu as arc is a big step up from iris, and it has an npu which is going to be more future proof and useful for ai related tasks. You also get the benefit of a 7 nanometer process, and more cores and threads. They both have really nice screens, although I would stay away from the oled display on the yoga as it would likely have burn in issues and reduce battery life. Finally the yoga has faster ram which can definitely make a difference. I'd say decide whether or not you'd be fine using an oled display on the yoga, and dealing with a few extra things (like auto hiding your taskbar, and using windows spotlight to change your background daily, and using dark mode). The yoga is the better laptop in my opinion.",

Heh, imagine food and stuff clogging the top mesh for the speakers, might be hard to clean. I really ought to stop eating food in front of my keyboard. Edit: Review commenter claims speakers are bottom facing, but also \"sounds upwards\".\n\nLooks like lots of venting holes at the front underside (or maybe it was back side), which I guess means one shouldn't place the laptop on top of fabric, like in your bed, risking covering the vent openings.\n\nI know from before that, althought one guy on the internet might be complaining about bad build quality or flaws, that might not be representative of the product that most people have, still, when someone comment on what they think is a flimsy or noisy laptop as some other model I checked, that is no fun.\n\nEdit: A reviewer comments that his integrated graphics version of this laptop, had noticeable noise when compared to the version with dedicated Nvidia card on it.\n\nEdit: I deleted some previous comment of mine about a reviewer's video review online, about a supposed 1 year old issue with some unknown configuration that probably is fixed by now. Also little if no info online found on this.",
  "I learned today that the 'CE' designation for the cpu, means \"creator edition\". Presumably, this might mean better performing cpu, or possibly, hotter cpu due to it being better performing. Sry, I am no expert on cpus, so I am not sure what to think about that.",
  "im planning on buying this laptop too, i think the new ryzen is the beast considering the efficiency per wattage of AMD is far better than Intel now (6nm vs 10nm), radeon680 is using newest tech of AMD(rdna2) for integrated GPU and is better than Iris Xe if you want gaming. Battery i think average 5-6hrs usage, maybe more if u just playing video all the time.",
  "Some things I think I've learned:\n\n(Edit: Oops, looks like the default non Intel wifi card also has 6G and ax built in.)\n\n~~The wifi card is 5G only, or (ac) standard, not ax (6G).~~ ~~Though it sort of looks like you can buy the Intel ax-210 wifi card, and get the ax standard for as little as $30-40 or something like that. Presumably Windows 11 has the drivers ready in the OS for it, and presumably, the Intel card is already whitelisted, but I honestly don't understand this whitelisting of devices, maybe an old thing by now, unsure.~~\n\nNo idea what quality the 1080p webcam has, maybe 5 megapixels? Maybe not.\n\nI hope I can install a Linux distro later, but that might be a little troublesome if Lenovo only officially supports Linux for their ThinkPad line of laptops. Or, maybe there isn't much of a problem, very much unsure about all of that.\n\nOne review seem to claim that \"storm gray\" is a silver gray, but it really seems like \"storm gray\" is a darker gray, and that the lighter gray is called \"cloud gray\".\n\nThere seem to be software for efficiently controlling the TDP limits with Ryzen cpu's, found at this website called 'AATU'. This should help lower any heat issue with boosts, to also reduce fan noise I think. A reviewer set the option to 1 sec, so the setting not only loads on boot, but is set every second to ensure the TDP limits are forced onto the cpu properly for the entire duration of your work session.\n\n[https://amdaputuningutility.com](https://amdaputuningutility.com) (Presumaly a legit website, but ofc one shouldn't blindly install software so maybe do some checks on this first.)\n\nThe 1080p camera, apparently has a privacy shutter which is nice. Then there is an infrared camera as well, which may or may not also be hidden behind the same cover.\n\nThe fingerprint sensor can be physically disconnected from the motherboard appartently. Unsure if that messes up anything in the OS. Unsure if that also disconnected the on/off button.\n\nI think I read that you can program the laptop to boot up, when you open the lid, and vice versa. Unsure if that requires the infrared camera to work or not.\n\nOnly iffy thing so far, might imo be the trackpad, which is said to be so so.\n\nI think I will be very happy with this choice overall, although there will never be any 32 GB ram upgrade.\n\nIt looks like you can easily fix your own laptop with authentic spare parts, which seems nice, and not too difficult. However, the keyboard is fused with the top side, and so, the entire (and presumalby non-metal) top side around the keyboard, has to be replaced, but might not be purchasable, but I guess you can ask their support perahaps for such a sparepart possibly.\n\nFor longevity of the battery, I think you have to rely on some Lenovo software that only charges the battery up to 80%, iirc, which seems like similar to some electric cars that by default charge just to 90%, to avoid premature wear on the battery.\n\nSadly, the usb ports only offer max 5 Gbps transfer rate, or less than 1GB per second  (probably much less) I think. The more advanced standard would have been the double transfer rate, 10 Gbps.\n\nLastly, there is afaik a very recent BIOS update, dated 2023 found on Lenovos website for the 14ARH7 variant which I think this configuration of Lenovo Ideapad 5 pro 14\" is called (unsure).",
  "and look at that 6400mhz ram, crazy.",
  "I think I might also replace the possibly OEM M.2 device with a 1 TB Samsung 980 pro one. I can keep the one with Win 11, whenever I need to update bios and such.\n\nI am pleasantly surprised by the seemingly nice screen resolution options on modern laptops like this one. Normally high res (2K) equate to tiny, OS icons, but there should be ways to scale those back up.\n\nGlad I don't have to look at another TN screen ever again. I had one with this greenish tint to it. :)  Not a laptop, but an old Eizo screen, a cheaper one."
