  "Any reviews/experience for the ThinkPad E14 G7 with Intel Ultra 7 258v CPU? I could only find reviews for the version with the 255U, because that version launched first.\nI'm mainly interested in it's battery life, because I'm looking for a laptop with decent performance and long battery life. \nNeeds to be x86 (want to dual boot Linux), so I've been looking at the Lunar Lake chips. Because Ram is soldered I'm going for 32 GB.\nThe other laptops I'm considering (Asus Zenbook, Vivobook 14, Lenovo Yoga slim 7, Acer Swift ai 14) all have glossy screens, the E14 G7 seems to be the only one in my price range (<1500€) with a matte screen.

  "its just gonna be maybe an hour less i dont think battery life is that deep of an issue",
  "I have a 268v cpu in my laptop and it is pretty slow compared to my desktop cpu. You would be better of getting an AMD HX 370 or 395.",
  "Yeah, I'm almost certain it will be fine, I just don't like the idea of buying a laptop without seeing at least one review of the specific model. Will probably buy it because spec wise it fits my needs the best",

  "MSI Prestige 14 A11SCX VS Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 2 Hello! I am in the market for a transportable, 16GB RAM, 14\" screen laptop with a good CPU and non-dependent GPU (this laptop will be used for GIS rendering programmes) with a price \\~1400€.\n\nThese two seem to me like the best options for my requirements:\n\nLenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 2 (Intel) (i7-1165G7/16GB/512GB/GeForce MX450/FHD/W10)\n\nMSI Prestige 14 A11SCX (i7-1185G7/16GB/512GB/GeForce GTX 1650 Max-Q/FHD/W10 Home)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom what I have gathered, the Lenovo is heavier (\\~1.6kg compared to the MSI's 1.3), has a smaller battery (45Whr compared to MSI's 52 ) and a worse GPU, but is RAM/SSD upgradable, has a great keyboard and carries the weight of the Lenovo ThinkPad name (I have owned an e11 gen 3 for 5 years and have been very satisfied with it).\n\nI have no opinion about MSI 's products' quality/longevity as I do not know anyone who owns one of their laptops. However, reviews mention that they make great gaming laptops. Moreover, there don't seem to exist many reviews specifically about the Prestige 14 A11SCX yet (sadly, it's not on notebookcheck), so I cannot really create a definitive image only by reading its specs.\n\nI would really appreciate your opinions on this comparison!",

But ig practicality says buy the vivobook! Also concern for both too is the price, when my parents, who are going to buy the laptop for me, see the price and that there is no 1 year warranty, they'll go nuts.

Was thinking about the Thinkpad E14 Gen 4 with AMD Ryzen 7 5820U processor and 16gb RAM (8gb soldered and 8gb SODIMM) for ~$770, but when I called Lenovo the rep said that people report a lot of problems with the thinkpad--especially the E series.

Can anyone who has experience with both attest to this?\n\nI should note that I dont plan on gaming or anything. Just for everyday/work use and for note taking/studying in college.

  "Difference between sRGB Coverage vs Color Space on Notebookcheck Hello, I was taking a look at [Thinkpad E14 on notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-E14-Laptop-Review-Thin-design-beats-upgradability.455279.0.html#toc-3) but saw these two different rows in the table describing the display: \"sRGB Coverage\" and \"Color Space (Percent of sRGB)\".\n\nI have a rough understanding that sRGB refers to how accurately the display reproduces the colors, but I don't understand the difference between these two terms. For [another laptop](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-Inspiron-14-Plus-7420-laptop-review-For-power-users-on-a-budget.643267.0.html#toc-4), I see that it is rated at 99% in \"sRGB coverage\" but is blank under \"Color Space (Percent of sRGB)\", so does that laptop have a better display than the Thinkpad E14 above?",
  "That would be a good question for the folks at Notebookcheck, why they have a separate section for \"Display\", and a separate section for \"Screen\", sharing the same thing tested under two slightly different names, with slightly different numbers.  Perhaps it was two different testing methodologies, or perhaps one is using the manufacturer's claimed specs.\n\nWhenever you see something that has only 60% of SRGB, that means it's not a full range 8-bit display (0-255), and is instead 6-bit (0-63).  You will see dithering when it tries to display anything in between.",

  "Looking for opinion of laptop: Lenovo ThinkPad L13 G2 + 3 other devices As it is, this laptop is a strong contender for me and my budget currently.

Both are customized orders with only noticeable difference being in \n\n* CPU version (AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 4750U Processor vs AMD Ryzen 7 4700U Processor): Single thread performance is comparable. AFAIK hyperthreading renders \\~30% more performance. My usecase won't be CPU intensive, so either is good enough. \n* ram (16GB + empty slot vs 8GB + 16GB): I'll be using it for development (Ram plays important role from productivity point of view when working on multiple projects and using heavy IDEs). \n* Warranty (3 yrs on site vs 1 yr via courier/carry-in): I'm not sure how much it costs to bump up that 1 yr to 3 years.

I have the E14 Gen6 (7735U but with the 57wh battery), and I have the ThinkBook 14 G8 (255H) and while the ThinkBook LOOKS better, the Thinkpad is better made.

The IdeaPad is good, but given the prices, not worth it I think.\n\nThen it's between the two. I'd pick AMD over Intel, and SODIMM memory. And significantly cheaper than the other.\n\nThe last has better resolution, but it's still a 14\", so pretty useless. It has faster RAM but it's soldered, and it's not a good idea, if you plan to upgrade your computer eventually.\n\nAnother point to note, as it may be useful for you eventually : ThinkPads are often certified for Linux, IdeaPads almost never.

  "T are for professional use, very robust design, good autonomy.\n\nP are more portable worstations, they are more powerful, sometimes with a discrete NVIDIA RTX Ada or Blackwell. Not cheap though.\n\nCompare the characteristics on the Lenovo site, for your price range.\n\nSome things to consider:\n\n* CPU: if you are going to do numerical computing, it might be useful to have AVX512, though I don't think it's mandatory. Check CPU boost frequency, cache size, number of cores and threads, and generation (newer generations have better IPC - instructions per cycle)\n* Memory: DDR5 is faster. SODIMM can be changed, but is typically a bit slower. Nowadays I think 32GB is more future-proof than 16GB.\n* Disk: SSD NVMe preferably. 512GB is not bad.\n* Screen: size, resolution (but higher resolution for small size is not really useful), OLED is better, check % of color space (lower will mean the screen is not capable to render all colors, but not necessarily a huge problem)\n* Battery autonomy\n* WiFi capability\n\nHonestly, for programming, even my IdeaPad 5 with a Zen 2 (5500U) is not bad at all (I have a similar laptop for work, it's a X13 with a 4500U I think), and 16GB RAM is not bad.\n\nBut it all depends on what you are programming: to learn about HPC, a good CPU or even a NVIDIA GPU (for CUDA) would be nice. For AI, a NVIDIA RTX (not GeForce) would be great, but they are expensive. But for \"simple\" C, Java, or web dev, I don't think you need a beast.\n\nI didn't consider the multiple docker instances: they will run on CPU, so more cores is better.

  "Thank you for the inputs, I am leaning towards the Firefly too due to the better warranty and higher RAM as compared to the P14. One of the posters above mentioned concerns with the hinge of E14 and that is a deal breaker for me. I value sturdiness and build quality far higher than the battery life.   \n  \nOut of curiosity, whats an amazing value for the E14 and am I getting a good price for the Firefly ?",
  "Thank you, I don’t care much about the audio quality. Do you know which one of P14 or Firefly has better build quality and durability ? Also, how much difference does the 32GB (Fireflly) vs 16GB (P14) RAM make and is that worth the extra $100 ??",
  "Had bad experiences with HP laptops tbh, the exhaust directly facing the hinge made the screen of my old elitebook bad. It had some burns, idk if its the heat or some ribbon cable problem. \n\nAnd I think you can never go wrong with a thinkpad, I'm using a Taiwanese laptop rn and the temps are quite great and the exhaust is directly facing the back portion with no obstruction.",
  "I paid $550 for my E14 Gen6 7735U.  Upgraded to the same screen the Firefly here has, 64GB ram, 4TB SSD, and all said, still under $1000.  Also having torn it apart already 4-5 times so had really good look at the hinges, not as weak as a lot of people think.  Yes, not as good as the T/P ThinkPads, but a far cry better than IdeaPad/Thinkbook hinges.\n\nGood price for the Firefly.  Those are not cheap devices usually despite they're literally just an Elitebook 845 with a different BIOS and only HS series choices for CPU.",
  "Build quality is going to be similar between the two.   \n  \nThe pain point for the ThinkPad is going to be the USB-C/Thunderbolt charging ports, which are a common point of failure on ThinkPads.\n\nThe pain point for the Firefly is going to be the cooling as the airflow isn't great out of the box. Adding a pair of kickstands to the firefly to raise the back end up will greatly improve the airflow and overall cooling.\n\nRAM is used whenever you open a program on the computer. The more RAM you have, the more things you can have running at once. If you get into on device AI stuff, the extra RAM may be a benefit, but both machines support upgradable RAM so it isn't really a big deal as you can always add more RAM to the machine later on and save a little money up front.",
  "I see, thank you for sharing your experiences. I'm currently leaning towards the HP though but will go to BestBuy and get a physical feel of both laptops",
  "You got a pretty good deal on that one, likely during the holiday season. I am leaning towards the Firefly and have the following config options (same price), which one would be better - \n\n1. AMD Ryzen™ 5 8640HS 4.9 GHz with 32GB RAM and Integrated AMD Radeon™ 760M  \nOR   \n2. Intel Core Ultra 5 125U 4.3 GHz with 16 GB RAM and Integrated Intel Graphics",

  "Do you want performance, or battery life?  8640HS better CPU performance by a fair amount, and a reasonable bit better iGP performance.  125U SIGNIFICANTLY better battery life out of the box.  These 2 CPU's are designed towards completely opposite spectrums.  The 125U is a better competition for the 7735U than the 8640HS given they're both geared towards low voltage efficiency.",
  "The Ryzen 5 8640HS - Slightly faster on the CPU side, noticeably faster on the integrated graphics side and more RAM out of the box.",
  "thank you so much for the inputs, that's helpful to know. I prefer prioritizing the CPU performance as I use my laptops plugged in 75% of the time so battery life is relative less important.",

  "Fried Charging / Power IC - Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 4  So a few weeks ago my laptop wouldn't turn on with the power plugged in and would only turn on if I removed the power cable, pressed the power on for 15-20 seconds straight. It would then boot up and work as expected, until I plugged in the charger to charge the battery which would then cause the laptop to shut down. Last week, the laptop wouldn't switch on no matter what but the LED light would turn on when plugged in. \n\nI took my laptop to a local service centre and upon inspection was told that the Power IC is fried and will need to be replaced. But the replacement of the power IC also didn't solve the problem and \"continued to short circuit the motherboard\" as per the technician. He finally gave up after multiple tries and returned the laptop to me after 4 days. \n\nWould appreciate any leads or help regarding this. I'm from Chennai, India. FYI, I have occasionally been using this laptop since I received it in June 2023. It has hardly been 16 months. ",
