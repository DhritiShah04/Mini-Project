  "Overheating: Ryzen vs Intel i5/i7 Dear all,\n\nI know that it is a long standing discussion, but still: are Intel i5/i7 CPUs tend to overheat less in general compared to Ryzen 5/7 ones?  \n\n\nAs an example, I have came across two reviews of Lenovo ThinkPad E15 Gen 2: [one with i7 (4 cores)+ discrete GPU](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-E15-Gen-2-Review-Tiger-Lake-laptop-with-an-Nvidia-GeForce-MX450.520540.0.html#toc-6), another one [with Ryzen 7 (8 cores) + integrated graphics](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-E15-Gen-2-Review-Office-laptop-with-an-AMD-chip-and-new-design.506035.0.html#toc-6). Underside temperature for them under load reached 47 and 67 degrees Celsius, respectively. Given that i7 version had discrete GPU, it still has much lower temperature (20 degrees difference). Perhaps it is not a surprise given twice as many cores, but yet.\n\nCould you tell me what is your experience? Thanks!",

I don't think \"browsing web pages\" will be any demanding in the future, regarding \"future-proofity'\n\n  \nYou couldn't have known that in a few years time a few more chrome tabs could choke your system so much, could you?

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Solución: ThinkPad T14s Gen 2 no se apaga completamente (LED parpadea, ventilador sigue encendido, se calienta en mochila)\" Anteriormente cuando apagaba mi laptop de alguna manera no see apagaba completa y dejaba el ventilador encendido y el pequeño LED parpadeando, lo que resultaba incómodo de transportar porque al estar funcionado en espacio cerrado se calentaba.\nLa solución fue...\n\n¡Hola a todos! Comparto mi experiencia con un problema común en la Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 2 (modelo 20WM, Intel), donde la laptop no se apagaba del todo al darle a \"Apagar\". Quedaba en un estado como de hibernación: el LED (bombillo) parpadeaba, el ventilador seguía corriendo, y si la metía en la mochila se calentaba mucho. Para encenderla de nuevo, tenía que forzar el apagado manteniendo el botón de encendido por unos segundos. La garantía ya había expirado, y ni técnicos locales ni actualizaciones estándar lo resolvían.\nEsto parece ser un bug conocido relacionado con un driver conflictivo (ELAN SMBus Driver), según boletines de Lenovo (como HT513888) y foros. Después de probar varios pasos, lo resolví eliminando ese driver específico. Aquí va un guía completa con todo lo que intenté y la solución final. Asumo Windows 10/11; si usas otro SO, adapta.\nPasos previos que probé (y no resolvieron solos, pero son recomendados para diagnosticar):\nDesactivar inicio rápido: Ve a Configuración > Sistema > Energía y suspensión > Configuración adicional de energía > Elegir el comportamiento de los botones de encendido > Cambiar configuración actualmente no disponible > Desmarca \"Habilitar inicio rápido\". Guarda y reinicia.\nDesactivar hibernación: Abre Símbolo del sistema (CMD) como administrador y ejecuta: powercfg -h off. Reinicia.\nReset de energía (power drain): Apaga (o fuerza), desconecta cargador y periféricos, mantén presionado el botón de encendido por 30-60 segundos. O usa el agujero de reset en la parte inferior (con un clip por 10-15 seg). Reconecta y enciende.\nActualizar todo via Lenovo Vantage: Instala la app si no la tienes, actualiza drivers, BIOS y firmware. Verifica que BIOS esté en la versión más reciente (en mi caso, 1.36.38 o superior; descarga manual desde support.lenovo.com si Vantage no lo detecta).\nTroubleshooters de Windows: Configuración > Sistema > Solucionar problemas > Otros solucionadores > Alimentación > Ejecutar. También en CMD como admin: sfc /scannow y DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth.\nModo Seguro: Reinicia con Shift presionado > Solucionar problemas > Opciones avanzadas > Configuración de inicio > 4 para Modo Seguro. Prueba apagar ahí para ver si es software tercero.\nReset BIOS a defaults: Enciende presionando F1 para entrar a BIOS > Exit > Load Optimal Defaults > Save and Exit.\nSi nada de esto resuelve, pasa a la solución principal.\nSolución que funcionó: Eliminar el driver ELAN SMBus conflictivo\nEste driver (no nativo de Intel) causa el bloqueo en el apagado. Lenovo recomienda reemplazarlo por el de Intel.\nConfirma el driver:\nAbre Administrador de dispositivos (busca en menú de inicio).\nExpande \"Dispositivos del sistema\".\nBusca \"ELAN SMBus Driver\" (o similar). Clic derecho > Propiedades > Detalles > \"Nombre de INF\". Anota el nombre (en mi caso, oem62.inf; puede variar como oemXXX.inf).\nDesinstala el driver via CMD:\nAbre Símbolo del sistema como administrador.\nNavega al directorio: cd \\windows\\system32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\nEjecuta: pnputil /delete-driver oemXXX.inf /uninstall /force (reemplaza oemXXX.inf con el tuyo, ej. oem62.inf).\nVerás un mensaje como \"Paquete de controladores desinstalado\" y \"El paquete de controladores se eliminó correctamente\". Ignora la nota sobre /force si aparece; es normal.\nReinicia la laptop: Después, el driver Intel debería cargarse automáticamente. Prueba apagar: ahora toma unos segundos extra (normal), el LED se apaga completamente, y el ventilador se detiene sin calor residual.\nVerifica post-reinicio:\nEn Administrador de dispositivos, el SMBus debería decir \"Intel SMBus\" ahora.\nSi no, descarga manualmente \"Intel Chipset Device Software\" desde support.lenovo.com para tu modelo y actualiza via Vantage.\nChequea el Visor de eventos (busca en menú) > Registros de Windows > Sistema > Filtra por \"Kernel-Power\" para ver si hay errores (como código 41).\nDespués de esto, mi T14s Gen 2 se apaga y enciende perfecto. No más forzados ni calor en la mochila. Si reaparece (por updates de Windows), repite la desinstalación.",
  "LOCKED BIOS - Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE) I bought a Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE) at an auction. The BIOS/UEFI is locked with a Supervisor Password. A repair shop reflashed both EEPROMs from scratch (64 MB BIOS REGION and 16 MB ME REGION), but the password remained. They concluded the password resides in the MEC1723N EC, which isn’t rewritable with conventional bench tools and also has epoxy underneath, making replacement difficult. I’m trying to contact the original company to have it cleared officially.\n\n**Device**  \nModel: ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (Intel), Type 21HE\n\n**Repair shop’s assessment**\n\n* From their investigation (including reading and analyzing the extracted hex), they did not find any sector in the EEPROMs where the password might be stored.\n* Conclusion from their studies: on some T14 units, the Supervisor Password is stored in the **Embedded Controller (EC)**, specifically the **MEC1723N**.\n\n**Practical issues:**\n\n* The MEC1723N would have internal firmware with no known method for reflashing using standard bench tools;\n* Lenovo uses black resin/epoxy under the chip, making desoldering/replacement almost unfeasible;\n* Even swapping in a “blank” chip would require the proper EC firmware, which the shop does not have.\n\n**Technical confirmation:**\n\n* On a **ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE)** with **MEC1723N**, does the **Supervisor Password** indeed reside in the EC?\n* Has anyone here successfully **reprogrammed or replaced a MEC1723N** (preserving firmware integrity), or can confirm that it cannot be done without Lenovo’s proprietary resources/firmware?\n\n**Legitimate paths:**\n\n* Beyond **system board replacement** and the **official process via the previous owning company**, is there any **authorized route** (e.g., **Lenovo Authorized Service Centers**) that can **reflash/synchronize the EC** to clear the SVP?\n\nThank you.",
  "The MEC1723N does contain the SVP, and reading online from people who have attempted it, it is very much possible to remove the black resin, although with some roughness.\n\nhttps://www.badcaps.net/forum/troubleshooting-hardware-devices-and-electronics-theory/troubleshooting-laptops-tablets-and-mobile-devices/3498772-guide-to-transplant-mec1503-ec-chip-and-eeprom-reprogamming-for-t14s-gen-2-and-x13-gen-2\n\nMy best bet would be replacing the whole chip with a cleanly flashed one, and then after using this guide to change your model name, serial, etc back to original",

Battery wise it lasts about 4 hours in Balanced battery mode but I’ve only charged it to 80% (that’s the default battery life extending feature). It’s pretty fragile though so you have to be careful not to drop it. Overall, I’d recommend it",
  "Thank you. Did you face any issues overall?",

  "Is the Lenovo ThinkPad E16 gen 2 with HS processors undervolted? If not do they overheat? Hi Reddit, This is Kavin. My laptop had stopped working recently. So I was wondering if I could get a reliable laptop that could last me for the maximum amount of time. Of course, my first preference was to get a ThinkPad. I've done my research across all the other brands and ended up looking at a ThinkPad, which is pretty good in terms of specs. One thing that ached me was that this exact model has a HS processor, which might be undervolted by Lenovo; if not, it might overheat.

But I will be playing games like Apex Legends, Counter-Strike 2, etc.\n\n# Expectations:\n\nI'm a 16-year-old guy. I expect this laptop to last me for a period of 5-7 years. I don't want anything like hardware requirements to stop me from doing my work, which is mostly school work, some light games, and university projects. I wanna make the most out of this laptop, so pls put your recommendations on how to use it efficiently or the first things to do on this laptop (pls don't tell me not to play games). In conclusion, I want a smooth time with this laptop.\n\n# Questions:\n\n1. Is this undervolted by Lenovo?\n2. Will it overheat? (Are the thermals good enough to support this processor?)\n3. Should I go for this one instead (Which has Ryzen 5 U processor): [https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nr00](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nr00)\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nI would like to know what you ppl think. I would really like some recommendations that fulfil all my needs around this price range. Pls answer my questions, guys (would really appreciate it). Pls let me know what I'll have to buy(Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7) according to my needs and preferences. Also, feel free to ask me anything you need to know in order to clarify my doubts. Lastly, thank you for reading and providing your opinion, guys. Hope this helps me and others, too.",

  "Firefly and P14s going to have the highest performance, and despite their core deficiency, it will be a reasonable amount.\n\nE14 will actually have the best iGP performance.  The gen on gen improvements for the 760M simply aren't enough to overcome pure hardware grunt of the 680M.\n\nOut of the box battery life the E14 will STOMP the other 2.\n\nZbook has, by a very good amount, the best screen, although the P14s doesn't ahve a bad screen.  E14's is usable...but noone will ever make the mistake of calling it good.\n\nValue here the Firefly, despite costing the most, wins with it's better display, better warranty, and more ram.  I'm totally not impressed with the P14s for the price here.  Far too far behind the Firefly in too many ways without being cheaper enough to justify itself.\n\nI really love my E14 Gen6 7735U, and mine was an amazing value, but at that price, it simply doesn't offer a value proposition that can compete with the Firefly.  I do actually own the prior generation P14s (P14s Gen4 AMD) and Firefly (Zbook Firefly G10A).  So I'd take Firefly > E14 G6 > P14s.",
  "Either the P14s Gen 5 or the Firefly.\n\nThe E14 is a hinge failure in the making.\n\nAudio quality favors the Firefly, cooling favors the P14s.",
  "What are the implications of the exhaust placement not being great and can that be fixed through a laptop fan ?",
  "Thank you for the inputs, I am leaning towards the Firefly too due to the better warranty and higher RAM as compared to the P14. One of the posters above mentioned concerns with the hinge of E14 and that is a deal breaker for me. I value sturdiness and build quality far higher than the battery life.   \n  \nOut of curiosity, whats an amazing value for the E14 and am I getting a good price for the Firefly ?",
  "Thank you, I don’t care much about the audio quality. Do you know which one of P14 or Firefly has better build quality and durability ? Also, how much difference does the 32GB (Fireflly) vs 16GB (P14) RAM make and is that worth the extra $100 ??",
  "Had bad experiences with HP laptops tbh, the exhaust directly facing the hinge made the screen of my old elitebook bad. It had some burns, idk if its the heat or some ribbon cable problem. \n\nAnd I think you can never go wrong with a thinkpad, I'm using a Taiwanese laptop rn and the temps are quite great and the exhaust is directly facing the back portion with no obstruction.",
  "I paid $550 for my E14 Gen6 7735U.  Upgraded to the same screen the Firefly here has, 64GB ram, 4TB SSD, and all said, still under $1000.  Also having torn it apart already 4-5 times so had really good look at the hinges, not as weak as a lot of people think.  Yes, not as good as the T/P ThinkPads, but a far cry better than IdeaPad/Thinkbook hinges.\n\nGood price for the Firefly.  Those are not cheap devices usually despite they're literally just an Elitebook 845 with a different BIOS and only HS series choices for CPU.",
  "Build quality is going to be similar between the two.   \n  \nThe pain point for the ThinkPad is going to be the USB-C/Thunderbolt charging ports, which are a common point of failure on ThinkPads.\n\nThe pain point for the Firefly is going to be the cooling as the airflow isn't great out of the box. Adding a pair of kickstands to the firefly to raise the back end up will greatly improve the airflow and overall cooling.\n\nRAM is used whenever you open a program on the computer. The more RAM you have, the more things you can have running at once. If you get into on device AI stuff, the extra RAM may be a benefit, but both machines support upgradable RAM so it isn't really a big deal as you can always add more RAM to the machine later on and save a little money up front.",

  "Lenovo Thinkpad T16 Gen 4 - worth waiting for?? I have been searching for a new laptop and leaning towards the Thinkpad T16. Truth is that i'm pretty desperate for a replacement laptop as i'm using a Samsung which is about 13 years old and the display is terrible. I have seen that the Thinkpad T16 Gen 4 is going to be released in May / June. \n\nThe current Lenovo range is Gen 3 (intel only) or if I wanted AMD it's the Gen 2 with soldered RAM which isn't great from an upgradability perspective. I imagine the AMD version will be slightly cheaper than intel and am not overly bothered about Intel vs AMD. \n\nThe difference from what I have seen between Gen 3 and Gen 4 doesn't look hugely drastic. Is it worth waiting for Gen 4 and possibly buying AMD and saving some money? Or just pick up a Gen 3 Intel now? ",
  "I’m in a similar situation but my current laptop is still functioning, just very slow. I am planning to wait for gen 4 because the performance on gen 3 intel chips seems pretty underwhelming.",

  "haha....that's a question! I did buy the AMD Gen 4 version with AI 7 PRO 350 processor. After about a week or so I noticed when I was watching a video on YouTube / Twitch and I made it full screen, there was briefly some white lines across the screen. I also noticed if the room was quiet and I went to load up a page or something that there was a soft click each time. I started threads on here about these issues. Chat GPT said the lines could be a graphical glitch or maybe some incompatibility with drivers. I did try some troubleshooting steps and was unable to resolve it. Lenovo Tech Support got in contact and were going to arrange a repair but I didn't want to start getting into the repair process within a few weeks so I returned the laptop. They were fairly minor niggles but i'd spent a lot on the computer and thought it shouldn't have these issues after a few weeks. \n\nI have been doing research for what to buy next and can't decide between Elitebook or T16 intel version.

  "Asus Vivobook S16 OLED (S5606CA) or wait for Lenovo ThinkPad T16 Gen 4? Hey folks, I’m torn between getting the **Asus Vivobook S16 OLED (S5606CA)** now or waiting for the **Lenovo ThinkPad T16 Gen 4**.\n\nI’ll mainly use it for work — I run a company (SemioDigital), and I’m a sysadmin with a focus on Linux and cybersecurity. I’ll also do some light content creation on the side.\n\nThe **Vivobook** is tempting: for the price, you get a latest-gen i7, solid performance, light chassis, good battery, and that OLED screen is just gorgeous… but glossy.\n\nOn the other hand, the **ThinkPad** is a business classic — more rugged, easier to service, has a matte display (less pretty but more practical), and overall better for long-term use. The downside is that it’s heavier, the current screen isn’t great (compared to the oled), and I’d have to wait for the Gen 4 to match the Vivobook’s specs — at a higher price.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar dilemma? Thoughts?",
  "Why not the vivo book with the HX370?",
  "I've briefly had vivobook with hx370 - mediatek wifi was basically unusable ( newest firmware, newest kernel on ubuntu). So what i've done is configured a environemnt and that's it - but seemed to work great other than that wifi issue, and some random internet guy have said that havent got the same issue as mine.  \n  \nNow i'm rocking intel core ultra 255h version of that vivobook, and it has some weird performance issues - something like it would be heavily bottlenecked with storage? Or maybe sometimes it let's those ultra efficient cores to work on something? Not sure, \"wait\" in top rises, nothing is happening when it should be launching an app.  \nIt does work slower under linux when it comes to blender. Some blender operations do impact whole system, and it can freeze.\n\nIt is maybe because of some drivers are not ready yet?\n\nGlossy screen in great indoors, somewhat useable outside - especially in shadowed area.\n\nIt gives me about 6hours of battery under linux, while doing some light coding. Not great, but kindof enough for me.  \nIt does throttle heavily while charging(sic!) - something is triggering PROCHOT. So no real work while it's charging :|\n\nI've tested it under ubuntu 25, with linux 6.14.\n\nTomorrow is last day that i can return it, and i think that i will - this experience is not as good as price was high.",

  "Razer Blade 16 2025 vs Asus G16 2025 vs Thinkpad P1 Gen 8 maybe? Hi!\n\nI'm not a gamer and I don't use laptops to play games. However, I am a programmer and use my laptop to compile some pretty big C++ projects and do some CUDA stuff so I need a good CPU, a decent Nvidia GPU, and at least 64G of RAM. I'm using a Thinkpad X1 Carbon currently and it definitely couldn't handle my workload. So now I'm looking for a new laptop which can handle my workload. Here are my requirements, from most important to good-to-haves:\n\n1. Balance of power and efficiency (battery life) - I often switch between connecting my laptop to a dock/power and bringing it with me on the go so its battery life cannot be a weak point. But I don't really care about benchmark scores. I don't expect it to have macbook-level insane 14-hour battery either. \"Balance\" is what I'm looking for.\n2. RAM at least 64G\n3. Nvidia GPU - 5080 looks like a reasonable choice\n4. Bright screen, since I often work on my terrace in the sun\n5. Other misc stuff like good keyboard, good build quality, etc\n\nBased on those, I've been interested in Razer Blade 16 2025 with 5080 GPU. But then Asus G16 2025 looks also nice. Reviews like [this ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3b17_zTtXc&t=479s)even picked Asus G16 as the better laptop all around, since it has better battery life, better keyboard etc. I've also heard some reports about the reliability issues of Razer laptops such as battery bloating etc. Wonder whether that has improved at all.\n\nBut what I don't understand is, with an Intel i9, how could the G16 has a better battery life than Blade 16 which has a (supposedly) more efficient AMD CPU? Is it because of the power management or throttling that they implement? I always wanted an AMD CPU but this comparison just seems very surprising to me.\n\nI've been a Thinkpad fan but their current laptop lines don't have a decent model that has AMD CPU + Nvidia GPU. (P16v and such look awkward because of those numpads.) P1 looks nice, but its battery life seems questionable. I wonder how G16 pulls off a better battery life. If Asus G16 is a better balance of power and efficiency, I could just wait for P1 Gen 8 since it suits my needs better..?\n\nWhat are your suggestions? Let me know. Thanks!",
