  "Lenovo Thinkpad T14 Gen 4 (Secondhand) I was searching for a secondhand laptop just to use it for my Browser Work and also for Entertainment like watching movies and etc while traveling. Light Gaming should do but I already have my PC for that. This laptop that I bought from a store has this specs:\n\nLenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 i5 1340P 13th Gen 16GB RAM 1TB SSD \n\nI bought it for $650.\n\nIs this a good deal? I am concerned about the chipset since some of the reviews says that it heats easily. Also, there are no AMD variants for this T14 lineup.",
  "Hey, I'm kinda late to this post, but whatever.\n\nI bought an used t14 with an i7 10th gen, and, if you're planning on using it as an actual laptop (that is, on your lap) while doing heavy work I don't think I'd recommend it. That's because of the constant overheat. When put on battery saver mode, it doesn't heat up as much, but if you run it even on balanced mode.... it almost burns my skin.",
  "Onde você comprou?",
  "Asus Vivobook Flip14 vs Thinkpad X13 Gen 2 All the following models are second hand, with only 1 week warranty. The store has good reviews and is seasoned. I've always thought Thinkpads would've fit me. I love Thinkpads, it's heritage and design. I was on a tight budget back then hence I opt for older Thinkpad models- I've grown attached. I haven't had a model, but I damn think it would've been perfect for my college (BS Microbio here).\n\nNo another accessory function that I also looked for, aside from decent build quality, great keyboard, 1080p screen, i5 8th gen up, and 16gb ram, I also sought for the 2 in 1 functionality. Because in college, especially my program, wherein annotation and drawing newman projections and the lot is frequent. It'll be dandy and convenient to be able to write it digitally. Although I still stick with traditional notes, the option would be great. Although makes me question whether I just get a separate tablet altogether, but convenience is key. So I'm just conflicted, specs wise the asus\n\nThe Thinkpads that I thought were great. There's a buttload of other great thinkpads, e.g., L14, E14, and etc., but it'd make everything longer.

I actually like vivobook and zenbook build quality, especially their 14 inch models with metal chassis. I'd also would've preferred the numpad on the trackpad mostly since I've grown accustomed to using the number pad.\n\nIdk there's just a flare when it comes to Thinkpads, especially in a country where it's an enterprise system, newer models, except the E series, are directly distributed to corporate companies and are not sold directly to everyday consumers like I am. But ig practicality says buy the vivobook! Also concern for both too is the price, when my parents, who are going to buy the laptop for me, see the price and that there is no 1 year warranty, they'll go nuts. Hence, it's better if it were a lot cheaper.",
  "Are any Windows laptops ACTUALLY worth it nowadays? I seem to hear complaints with all of them (at least around the £700-£1200 mark). Dell XPS/Latitude, Acer Swift Go, Asus Zenbook 14. You name it, I read good things, but loaaads of bad things... And then everyone says go to Thinkpads  instead.  \nWhich is nice of course.  \nBut really puts you off these mid/premium consumer ones and if it's worth 'taking a risk' on them.\n\nI'm on the lookout for a 'general home-use/entertainment' + starting a career in IT soon laptop, and 1 week into the research stage. Also something futureproof.  \nA ***Thinkpad Gen 5 T14 (£1171)*** is top of the list atm, but what if I wanted something OLED, slimmer, and nicer designed/clean?\n\nI've looked at some decent non-Thinkpad versions like the ***Dell XPS/Latitude*** series, ***Acer Swift Go 14***, & ***Asus Zenbook 14***.  \nLoads of reviews, positive here and there, but also quite serious comments about big issues with them.  \nAnd then it just doesnt seem worth it...  \nDo you buy them, and then possibly find them breaking in a year or 2? Or get lucky and have it all fine for 4+ years like many users as well?\n\nWhat the fudge of a Windows laptop is worth it nowadays?!?\n\nAHHhhhh......!!",
  "its not about windows. its just the downsides of owning a laptop.\n\nif you value a good price i recommend to just look at the used/refurbished market.\n\nyou can get a refurbished dell lattitue 7490 or 7590 for like $250 nowerdays.\n\nits an ultrabook with 8th gen i5 or i7 and you can get models with 16gb of RAM and 256/512gb SSD. also windows11 compatible.\n\nand thats all you really need for anything relating to office tasks or watching youtube.\n\ncomes with thunderbolt and all the bells and whistles. when it was new it was a $1000+ business device,\n\nand t his beats out any \"new\" $250 laptop you can find",
  "Nothing to do with'windows - but rather 'consumer' grade v. business build quality\n\nMost people buy consumer grade laptops that are essentially built to cost (as the manufacturer makes most of the money off the initial sale) - the whole strategy is to make the laptop lasts just so slightly longer than the warranty, after which if it breaks = extra $$$ for a new sale\n\nBusiness laptops on the other hand are built to last - as companies often pay (ridiculous money) for multi-year servicing plans on top of the initial purchase - so if the laptop breaks during this period, it actually costs the manufacturer money to repair/replace it\n\nThe extra cost of better build qualtiy (in terms of materials and often cheaper labour) up front is much less than having to pay for the man-hours of on-site support, skilled labour (often in a western country) and courier fees when trying to fix any problems later\n\nThere is a reason why thinkpads / elitebooks have a cult following - and many 2nd hand business laptops often out last the majority of consumer laptops sold new",
  "You can’t listen to 95% of the people on here. There isn’t a huge quality difference between the major brands (beware the unknown/less known brands on Amazon and elsewhere). \n\nAlso, for commercial PCs, ThinkPads aren’t as good as they used to be. They’re still good, but 10 years ago they were the hands-down best - they’re not anymore.",
  "In short: no, you gotta buy the one where you mind the drawbacks the least",
  "I have had luck with the Lenovo IdeaPad line. Mine work great for about 4 years. I often upgrade to a new 1 then.\n\nLenovo Thinkpad and HP Elite book have much better build quality than the 450usd models.\n\nThinkpad T with Ryzen 7 is a nice way to go. Ryzen 7 has good speed with low battery drain.",
  "I just bought the Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 (the one with the Ryzen AI 9 365) and have zero problems. Maybe you should look into that, it’s slim and fast, although a little bit pricey.",
  "In my experience avoid Acer and Asus laptops.\n\nIf you want something 'price to performance' look at something like Chuwi. HP also has good 'price to performance' offerings, but their build quality is shit.\n\nIf you want something with high build quality, but not performance focused, I recommend Fujitsu.\n\nDell is okay. They don't excel anywhere but also have few drawbacks.\n\nLenovo is good.",
  "If you want a slimmer, nicer T14, then you may want to consider the T14s. It's not a huge difference from the regular T14, but a little bit slimmer and lighter and from more expensive materials.\n\nI recently got a T14s for 1200 €, and the catch here was that I bought an older generation on a good sale. The latest generation T14s tends to be closer to 2000 €.\n\nI'm partial to ThinkPads in general, but I think they are excellent laptops with one of the best keyboards even on the latest models. They are better made than most.",
  "Go for a Lenovo x1 carbon. You won't be disappointed.",
  "Every laptop has tradeoffs in different places, and the cheaper you go the more tradeoffs. You have to choose what's important to you, price, battery life, power, OS, build quality, bloat software, etc.",
  "It a quality issue, not a windows issue, take HP as an example with their hinges issues.",
  "The X9 15\" looks great - you can get it for \\~£1200 with lenovo discounts if you don't mind the lack of nipple",
  "I have very few complaints about my lenovo slim7x, only really that the camera and speakers suck, but I never play things out loud and the camera is still decent enough for video calls; besides, the speakers and camera on a macbook aren’t really that much better anyways. I choose windows because I play a few games on here that wouldn’t be great on a macbook and I hate the apple system in general. Everything that I care about in this laptop is comparable or better than a MacBook at the same price imo (unless it breaks quick but it feels very well built)",
  "Purchased Lenovo Ideapad 5 with Ryzen 8645HS, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD for $837. 16\" beautiful OLED 120Hz. Full metal. Cannot complain. The Abyss Blue is sight for a sore eye.",
  "every laptop has something stupid about it. These companies keep trying to copy apple. It's the hardest thing to purchase. I'm most likely going to get a surface pro in a few years. someone tell me why that's a bad idea please",
  "Laptop is always handy. Yes, there are some problems with intel, but they say that is behind them. NVidia is selling GPU 5 series extremely expensive.\n\nI went for AMD. A 2 year old version (it has no 2025 newest GPU or CPU, but brandnew bought) , did not hear any conplaints about that one so, that must be good. Any laptop with Ryzen 7 or 9, with an older 4 series GPU like 4070, 4080, 4090 for thr right price is a bargain compared to alptop with NVIDIA 5 series. So , if you see a good 4070, 4080, or 4090 laptop, buy it.",
  "Thinner and breaking in a year or 2 go hand in hand. We gave up on owning the thin 2-in-1s after my wife's second one (HP x360) broke a hinge. There just isn't enough meat to make them last. \n\nCorporations don't put as much engineering into their gamerboi laptops as they do their professional lines. My Dell G5 was a POS that fell apart fast. The plastic was cheap. My previous Dell Precision M6800 was a tank of a build. If I dropped it the floor broke not the laptop.\n\nWe have 2 ThinkPad E16s now and they feel solid and well built with internally upgradable space for RAM and another NVMe.",
  "I really liked the Zephyrus G14. Managed to snag a 2022 that had an RX 6800S for 1099 CAD. Battery life is good enough but the versatility is amazing. Lots of ports (in comparison to an Ultrabook), great screen, good trackpad/keyboard, relatively thin and light, good build quality, and lots of performance on tap.",
  "No laptop is perfect. You need to look at what you need and buy the one that best suit you. I just bought an Asus Vivobook with the latest Intel 258V cpu, 32G ram and 1 Tb ssd. It doesn't have a stellar multicore performance but excel in single core and battery life. I am very happy with it  even though it is not perfect.",
  "All laptops aren’t worth it for value, if you’re gonna buy one look for ones on sale",
  "Not the cheapest, but have a look at https://Frame.work\n\nPlus consider dual booting with linux",
  "I just bought a HP Spectre x360 OLED, open box for $700. I felt it was worth it so far. Build quality has got to be one of the best.",
  "The problem is that for the manufacturer profit margins per laptop are thinner these days than they used to be, so they cut costs where they can, and manufacturing processes aren’t perfect so some of what they produce will be lemons.\n\nCombine those two and a certain percentage of every manufacturer will suck, and you have a non zero chance of buying one every time you buy a laptop.\n\nGo to every manufacturer’s forums/subreddits and even £2500 laptops have problems.\n\nThere is no answer other than pick your poison and hope. You will be fine most of the time.",
  "There are no perfect laptops. Pick the one THATS has the compromises that you can live with. For example my gaming laptop the asus g14 2024 is perfect for me. I traded having a form factor I wanted for weaker performance",
  "Dell Precision, XPS, or thinkpad TPXZ series is about all there is IMO. And Dell naming scheme 2025 and up is confusing as hell. \n\nIf you care about battery life, the Z13 thinkpad is the best of the bunch, right there with Macbooks (IPS screen, not OLED) If it's performance you want, a P series Thinkpad or Dell Precision that can take 100+ gb of RAM and comes with high output CPU/GPU and fast drives is more suited to that type of work. \n\nOf.course if it's home media and IT training, why not build your own server box? \n\nIt's OK to go a few years older BTW, just mind the RAM speeds and be sure it's got an upgrade slot available at minimum. Nothing wrong with a $400-500 T series.",
  "Yes.\n\nThe Internet makes every issue seem worse than they really are.",
  "The only reason why people buy laptops is because they \"need\" the mobility. Laptops are terrible in price to performance. I have never seen a laptop i would say yes thats a really good deal when comparing to normal PCs. \n\nIf you don't need that you are way better off buying or even building your own PC.",
  "I don't think the gap is that much between thinkpad and others. I use an Asus laptop for 5 years. Most of my friends also use Asus. So far they are good. I think Asus vivobook pro will give you the things you need.",
  "HP laptops are the most solid and long lasting. I have one from 8 years ago and it's still in good condition despite regular use. I had another HP laptop before that from 2010 to 2015. But the Sony, Dell and Lenovo laptops I had became trash in less than 3 years.",
  "Rog Strix 15",
  "I think people exxagerate too much, ive had shitty consumer grade Acer for daily use for 8 years. Now after that i have dell already for 7 years. Both still work flawlessly exept batterylife.",
  "People don't talk when expectations are met, it's only when they're far exceeded or not met that they talk online. \n\nTake my XPS for example, literally had no issues, and never had to tell anyone it's performing as expected \n\nWhat you said is true for anything and everything",
  "Remember what you see in here and the complaints that you see are probably 1% to 5% of the units made and sold. If everything That gets built was damaged or didn't work the companies would go out of business so fast it would make your head spin. Do yourself a favor and whenever purchasing a laptop or computer get a 5-year extended warranty to help calm your nerves It may cost a little bit more but if something goes wrong within 5 years you just return it to the seller so they can repair it. Just remember extended warranties do not cover abuse or damage done by the user.",
  "Have you tried buying a  dell plus",
  "Dells are great, Acers I have always had bad experiences with, same with HP. I own a bunch of gently used thinkpads but I wouldn't but a brand new one, at that price range almost any laptop is great. MSI is as bad as Acer. To be honest: tt depends on what you are going to need them for, if it's just for browsing the internet and Office 365 stuff, almost any laptop will do.",
  "Don't buy consumer laptops, buy used business/enterprise ones, as long as you don't need high graphical performance.",
  "I’m still using an hp elite book from like 10 years ago because I got it for $150 at the time. It does everything I need it to do minus some lag with 3d rendering.",
  "Same applies to Thinkpads. The T14 is standard issue and lowest spec is 8GB RAM on a 10th gen i5, 256GB SSD, but they have a slot for another RAM stick and second SSD. Also 2020 and newer only on the T14 and T14s. (That doesn't apply equally across thinkpad lines, but T series is easy, T14 gen 1 is 2020.)\n\nAnyhow, 16GB, 512GB 10th i5 is $150-250 used excellent condition, minor wear. Without the charger or SSD, $120-150. \n\nGreat value to be had. Dells run about 30% more in my experience, but Precisions are often worth it, especially without Intel ME on fed versions.",
  "They stopped putting an ethernet port on 😆😂🤦\n\nThat 2.5mm key travel and the dozen or so ports is what made them amazing. That and the nipple makes them unique. They're dropping the trackpoint on some models and really irritating people who are loyal to them, despite the Thinkpad looking more like a Macbook Pro than a Thinkpad nowadays...",
  "thats the realest answer",
  "I have an IdeaPad from 2013, I reinforced some parts of it with superglue and thicker screws and replaced the hdd it had with an ssd, but it's still functional after over 10 years, I don't actively use it, but I turn it on and run updates on it once every few weeks just to keep it alive.",
  "How’s for coding?",
  "does Chuwi have any modern chips in their laptops? all of them seem horrible 12000 and 13000 intel? ryzen 7000? wtf",
  "I'm happy to go for the T14 (due to upgradeability and a few other perks).  \nBut I was just looking at alternatives that are good all round lol, hence the post.",
  "With T14s buy as much RAM installed as you can get. They went fully soldered on several. P series will typically all have slots vs soldered RAM, so a P1 may also be an option, but it isn't built to be light or have a long battery life. It's a higher performance workstation, but built on the X1 Carbon Extreme chassis vs the T14 chassis. \n\nGoing down in build quality, the L series also has full slots vs soldered. The T14 gen 5 has two slots as well, but previous generations only had one slot and one soldered RAM module.",
  "If I had to switch work laptops from MacBook Pro to windows this would be my choice.",
  "Microsoft support isn’t the best, from what I hear and until recently, they were a bugger to repair because they were glued together.",
  "Interesting. Loads say HP are 'Hinge-Problems' and arent great. But maybe the more premium models are decent...",
  "Very true.  \nCan i ask what model of XPS you have?",
  "Dell and great in the same sentence xD now thats a good joke",
  "Companies stopped making good laptops long ago",
  "I mean the Ryzen chips are good idk whats there to complain about, they have modern but not good N series Intel chips.",
  "The new 14 with the core ultra and the seamless trackpad",
  "Based on my own experience, I haven't had any issues with the XPS laptops myself.",
  "Plenty of P73's still out there pushing 20TB of storage and 128GB RAM. \n\nWe just never see them because people don't take them out the house or office. Might pull their back, and it kills their MPG putting one in the trunk.",
  "which laptop had half decent battery life in the good old days? And which ones were perfect without any flaws?",
  "They're all ancient. Years old at this point. ",
  "I wasnt talking about specs tbh, but yeah the modern thinkpads are alright",
  "AMD chips hold very well, I would still be confident in a 5-year-old Ryzens performance.",
  "I'm still heartbroken over key travel being trash nowadays and the number of ports steadily being reduced to one or two Thunderbolt 4 ports vs the dozen or so they used to have, so yeah, I sympathize. I'm especially disappointed that they did away with an ethernet port entirely on a machine that's supposed to be a workstation. (Makes perfect sense, do away with the most common attachment we have available for network access)\n\nIf Lenovo brought out a version with 2.5mm mechanical key travel and a centered, reasonably sized touchpad, with the trackpoint retained and 3rd mouse button, they'd sell it on that alone, but add back every modern port we use and a few less modern ports for backwards compatibility, and they'd be golden. \n\nStick to 2 drives and a 3rd that can be an adapter or a drive, then 4 RAM slots, and offer upgraded motherboards every 2 years with new processor and GPU, for 30% of the cost of the laptop, and they'd be heroes. \n\nI thought that was gonna be Framework, but no. Sadly.",
  "Well thats why i dont buy lenovo anymore",
  "US laptop market, you basically have Lenovo, or for 30% more, HP and Dell.

  "Atrocious battery in second hand laptop. I recently bought a second hand Thinkpad T14 gen4. I immediately factory reset and installed windows from a new flash drive, then yada yada downloaded all my stuff. Fast forward one week, and around 3 charge cycles later (don't use it much, simply for college), i notice that the battery life is terrible and the laptop seems to die in around 2 hours of moderate use. (Think discord in the background, maybe 30 minutes of youtube and the remaining 90 minutes simply browsing on google, emails, etc.) I ran a battery health check and it doesn't seem too bad, so what could be the cause of this battery issue, especially given that most reviews of the Thinkpad T14 Gen 4 suggest that it can last 5-6 hours? Is there anything I could do to fix this issue before i just buy a new battery and hope that fixes it?\n\nRuns on a i7-1355u.\n\nNote: I'm aware the \"Estimated Time remaining\" is to be taken with a grain of salt. However, the estimate is fairly accurate from my personal experience. The battery has drained 5% in the \\~7 minutes i took to write this, with no other applications open. ",
  "Batteries are a consumable item so you risk getting a worn out battery by purchasing a second hand laptop. Same as if you were to buy a used car from a small, mom & pop dealership or private party. Things like the tires, coolant, and battery may be worn out and need to be replaced. This is why used or second hand is often cheaper than new. \n\nGet rid of that battery (whatever it is). Jump online and search for an authentic and new T14 Gen4 battery, whether it's on Lenovo's website or eBay (just make sure it says \"Genuine\" or \"Original\") so you don't end up with another questionable aftermarket knockoff.\n\nYou can also tweak Windows to run leaner by turning off unnecessary programs as well as utilizing power plans for maximum battery life.",
  "That’s a very small battery…\n\nAlso, make sure that your battery isn’t being limited to save battery health. Check bios or Lenovo Vantage to see. For example, laptops since times limit battery charge to 60%-80% to extend battery health, if you leave plugged in a lot.\n\nThat would be way less battery life on an already tiny battery.",

You can try to open the back cover and make sure it's an original lenovo battery as a first step. \n\nIf it is, try to find a replacement battery online(stick to original lenovo ones). Maybe check if you have any space to fit a larger battery, as some thinkpad 14 gen4s come with a larger 52whr battery",

  "I have the same issue with my hp laptop, it is brand new, the battery health is at 105% but it still only lasts 6 hours on a charge with brightness 0, energy saver on, performance in best efficiency, and it has an intel core ultra 5, so it's supposed to be efficient.",

The company said that it’d be a company expense as long as the model is approved.

  "Which is better — ThinkBook 16 Gen 7 or ThinkPad E14 Gen 6? Hey everyone, I’m trying to decide between the ThinkBook 16 Gen 7 and the ThinkPad E14 Gen 6. I’ve heard mixed opinions.\n\nFrom what I see, the specs are very similar: both have aluminum tops and plastic bottoms. I haven’t seen a huge difference in build quality in real life. But a lot of people claim that newer ThinkPad E-series models are much better now than they used to be—and even better than ThinkBook in many respects.\n\nSo my question is: is it really worth paying ₹7000 extra for the ThinkPad?\n\nIf any of you have observed major differences (durability, thermal performance, screen, support, value, etc.), please drop your experience below. \n\nThanks in advance",

I have the E14 Gen6 (7735U but with the 57wh battery), and I have the ThinkBook 14 G8 (255H) and while the ThinkBook LOOKS better, the Thinkpad is better made.  Beyond that, they have EXTREMELY similar specs, and very similar max specs, so IMO the ThinkPad despite being better made, isn't so much better made that it's worth the extra $$.",

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Solución: ThinkPad T14s Gen 2 no se apaga completamente (LED parpadea, ventilador sigue encendido, se calienta en mochila)\" Anteriormente cuando apagaba mi laptop de alguna manera no see apagaba completa y dejaba el ventilador encendido y el pequeño LED parpadeando, lo que resultaba incómodo de transportar porque al estar funcionado en espacio cerrado se calentaba.\nLa solución fue...\n\n¡Hola a todos! Comparto mi experiencia con un problema común en la Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 2 (modelo 20WM, Intel), donde la laptop no se apagaba del todo al darle a \"Apagar\". Quedaba en un estado como de hibernación: el LED (bombillo) parpadeaba, el ventilador seguía corriendo, y si la metía en la mochila se calentaba mucho. Para encenderla de nuevo, tenía que forzar el apagado manteniendo el botón de encendido por unos segundos. La garantía ya había expirado, y ni técnicos locales ni actualizaciones estándar lo resolvían.\nEsto parece ser un bug conocido relacionado con un driver conflictivo (ELAN SMBus Driver), según boletines de Lenovo (como HT513888) y foros. Después de probar varios pasos, lo resolví eliminando ese driver específico. Aquí va un guía completa con todo lo que intenté y la solución final. Asumo Windows 10/11; si usas otro SO, adapta.\nPasos previos que probé (y no resolvieron solos, pero son recomendados para diagnosticar):\nDesactivar inicio rápido: Ve a Configuración > Sistema > Energía y suspensión > Configuración adicional de energía > Elegir el comportamiento de los botones de encendido > Cambiar configuración actualmente no disponible > Desmarca \"Habilitar inicio rápido\". Guarda y reinicia.\nDesactivar hibernación: Abre Símbolo del sistema (CMD) como administrador y ejecuta: powercfg -h off. Reinicia.\nReset de energía (power drain): Apaga (o fuerza), desconecta cargador y periféricos, mantén presionado el botón de encendido por 30-60 segundos. O usa el agujero de reset en la parte inferior (con un clip por 10-15 seg). Reconecta y enciende.\nActualizar todo via Lenovo Vantage: Instala la app si no la tienes, actualiza drivers, BIOS y firmware. Verifica que BIOS esté en la versión más reciente (en mi caso, 1.36.38 o superior; descarga manual desde support.lenovo.com si Vantage no lo detecta).\nTroubleshooters de Windows: Configuración > Sistema > Solucionar problemas > Otros solucionadores > Alimentación > Ejecutar.

  "LOCKED BIOS - Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE) I bought a Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE) at an auction. The BIOS/UEFI is locked with a Supervisor Password. A repair shop reflashed both EEPROMs from scratch (64 MB BIOS REGION and 16 MB ME REGION), but the password remained. They concluded the password resides in the MEC1723N EC, which isn’t rewritable with conventional bench tools and also has epoxy underneath, making replacement difficult.

  "Is the Lenovo ThinkPad E16 gen 2 with HS processors undervolted? If not do they overheat? Hi Reddit, This is Kavin. My laptop had stopped working recently. So I was wondering if I could get a reliable laptop that could last me for the maximum amount of time. Of course, my first preference was to get a ThinkPad. I've done my research across all the other brands and ended up looking at a ThinkPad, which is pretty good in terms of specs. One thing that ached me was that this exact model has a HS processor, which might be undervolted by Lenovo; if not, it might overheat.

  "ThinkPad T14(s) with Intel Ultra 7 268V Pro (32GB RAM) vs AMD Ryzen AI 9 360 (64GB RAM) Hi everyone,\n\nI'm planning to buy a new **ThinkPad T14s** (or T14) to replace my current laptop (**2nd gen X1 Yoga**) which has lasted me over **7 years**, and I’d like the new one to last at least **5–6 years** as well. Bugdet is not a major concern, considering I want to make the best long-term choice in terms of performance and reliability.\n\nMy usage is:\n\n* **Programming and development**\n* Running **2–3 virtual machines** at times\n* **Office work** (Excel, Word, Outlook, etc.)\n* Use it both **at home and at work**, and also **on the go**\n* It’s **docked and plugged in, with** an **external cooling fan,** most of the day\n\nI’m deciding between two configurations for the T14s and T14:\n\n* **T14s Intel Ultra 7 268V Pro** with **32GB RAM** (LPDDR5X-8533) with **IPS WUXGA** (1920x1200)\n* **T14s AMD Ryzen AI 9 360** with **64GB RAM (LPDDR5X-7500)** with **IPS WUXGA** (1920x1200)\n* **T14 AMD Ryzen AI 9 350** with **64GB RAM** (DDR5-5600) with **2,8K** (2880 x 1800) **OLED**\n\nThese configurations are the ones available for **Spain**, and according to Lenovo support, it’s **not possible to get an OLED display on the T14s** here. I don’t think OLED is a must for me, but I’m wondering if the **2.8K resolution panel** would be worth it over the standard IPS 1920x1200.\n\nI have tried to make my work and exit is what I found so far:\n\n* Benchmarks show **very similar performance** between the two CPUs.\n* **Intel seems slightly better in power efficiency**, while **AMD offers a bit more raw performance**.\n* The AMD config also comes with **64GB of RAM**, which is tempting for my VM-heavy workflow. The **Intel version is limited to 32GB of RAM**, and while that might be enough for now, I’m a bit concerned about how it will hold up under heavier workloads or in the long term.\n* **T14s uses LPDDR5 soldered memory**, which not only consumes less power but also offers **higher memory bandwidth** compared to the DDR5 SO-DIMM in the T14. That could be a small but meaningful performance edge in some workloads.\n\nSo finally, as a kind of a summary my questions are:\n\n* Is the **extra 32GB of RAM** in the AMD config worth it for future-proofing?\n* Is the **2.8K resolution** a meaningful compared with the use of LPDDR5X vs DDR5-5600? For reference, I currently use a **2.8K display on my Yoga** with **Windows scaling set to 150%**, which is almost working at 1920x1200 ;)\n* Any thoughts on **thermals, battery life, or driver support** between the two platforms?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts—especially if you’ve used either of these CPUs or the T14/T14s series recently.\n\nThanks in advance!",
  "I'd get the 64GB one, if you're running 3 virtual machines, you're basically running 4 Operating Systems, so on a 32GB machine you don't really have a 32GB machine, you have 4 8GB machines.\n\nI use laptops plugged into external screens so the built-in one doesn't matter to me.\n\nThe faster RAM might be nice, but I'd doubt it's noticeable in everyday use.\n\nFor me it's less a choice of Intel vs AMD, it's 32GB vs 64GB, and for the number of VMs you have, 64GB seems a better pick.",
  "Since you're mostly using it docked and plugged in, so insane battery life isn't going to be that important, I'd go wit the AMD T14s.  Insane battery life is the only real trump card for Lunar Lake (well, and REALLY impressive iGP), otherwise it's rather uninspiring.  The 64GB ram for future-proofing is, IMO, a better selling point for how you describe your workflow.",
  "If you use just only 1 VM, the 32GB difference is not so important. 3 is the most, but not all the time and days - mainly when testing automatation, etc. I'm usually with one open every day.\n\nThen, AMD vs Intel? I still don't know why Intel have set the maximum to 32Gb.",

  "Is the ThinkPad E16 Gen 2 a good choice for coding Hey everyone,\n\nI’m looking at the **Lenovo ThinkPad E16 Gen 2** (Ryzen 5, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) and wondering how it holds up — mainly in terms of **battery life (hoping for 4–12 hours)** and **durability**.\n\nI’d be using **Ubuntu** and mostly doing dev work:\n\n* Coding with **VS Code** and **PyCharm** (JavaScript/Python)\n* **Docker**, **Cursor** (LLM coding assistant)\n* **DBeaver**, **Postman**, and **Slack, Google Chrome**\n* Occasional **screen sharing**\n\nNo gaming, just multitasking and development.  \nAnyone using this laptop for similar stuff? Would you recommend it — or something better around this range?\n\nThanks!",
  "Battery life in Linux is always less than in win because Linux software is not optimized for laptops. Currently I'm using a ryzen5 5500u with 32gb ram for dev purposes, run everything without any issue, cursor, docker, mongo etc",
  "I use debian on WSL to do programming stuff, I've tried on win but is awful and I got a lot of nonsense problems.",
  "Thanks! I will consider using Win instead of Linux.",
  "Should I buy refurbished ThinkPad t490 i7 8th gen or new acer aspire 3 with i3 1315u? I am using an acer aspire 1 right now with 4 gb 64 gb ram and ssd, and both are soldered,it is unusable on normal windows, I want a laptop mainly for web browsing and accounting on Google sheets\n\nThinkPad price is 24k inr and aspire 3 is 32k\nBoth has same ram and ssd configuration and both are upgradable, but I guess ThinkPad has more room for upgrades than aspire 3",
  "The Aspire 3 will have the same soldered RAM/SSD as your current Aspire 1. Personally, I'd get the ThinkPad, it has more flexible upgrade options and has better build quality.",
  "I would get the Thinkpad. Much better build quality. Aspire 3 seemed underwhelming at Walmart.",
  "Take the newer 13th gen. Even though the thinkpad is built better, it is still at least 5 or 6 yeras old, already has some wear and tear on the hinges, won't have the same warranty, will not be supported by Windows as long anymore etc.\n\nThe i3 13th gen is probably also quicker in day2day use, supports higher clocked RAM and the more modern SSD is probably quicker as well.",
  "No it has upgradable ram and ssd,"
