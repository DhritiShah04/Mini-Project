  "IdeaPad Flex 5 or Slim 3? I'm about to start college in a few months, looking to go into video production. I need something that can handle editing software, and maybe some light gaming on the side (probably nothing more intensive than Minecraft or GMod/CS:Source though), and I found these two laptops at Walmart that seem pretty good. The innards of both of these are about the same. The Flex has a slightly higher-res screen (WUXGA > Full HD) and can become a tablet; the Slim 3 is a pound lighter yet $20 more expensive. Should I go with the higher res screen and tablet functionality of the Flex, or splurge a bit more for the lighter Slim 3? Or something different entirely? I'm conflicted.",
  "Review of Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 (15in, 16gb, 512gb SSD, AMD Ryzen 5700u) I bought the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 (15in, 16gb, 512gb SSD, AMD Ryzen 5700u) in India. Here is my review about it after using it for about 2 weeks.\n\n**Build:**\n\n* Update after 14 months (16 Oct 2022): Shit quality hinge. Broke twice till now without ever dropping the laptop.\n* Full plastic build. Metal Lid. Matte finish. Feels great and solid.\n* Keyboard and touchpad are great\n\n**General things:**\n\n1. Initially I had some problem with the speakers when they would stop working and I had to restart the laptop to fix. I got a driver update a couple days later, haven't had that same problem since.\n2. The fingerprint can be a hit or miss sometimes due to its design, I then added my fingerprint from multiple angles so mostly works but sometimes have to try again.\n3. My unit had some backlight bleed on the bottom right corner noticeable when in a dimly lit room at above 70% brightness. Not a problem for me since I dim the screen to around 30% in the dark. This will vary by laptop though.\n4. I have a problem with OBS recordings. It seems that OBS is recording at same volume as windows master volume. I haven't been able to find a fix for it. Every program I tried which captures audio from speakers to record/broadcast (OBS, XSlit, Anydesk) have the same issue.  **(EDIT: FIX: Roll Back Realtek (R) Audio drivers so that the manufacturer is Microsoft, Dolby audio will stop working though if you do it. Not recommended.)**\n5. The product description states that it has Bluetooth 5.0 but the device manager says its Bluetooth 5.1.\n\n**Expandability**:\n\nI opened mine up coz of curiosity. The internal design is the same as last years version.\n\n1. The RAM is soldered in dual channel. (Task Manager)\n2. There is one M.2 NVME SSD slot which is already populated with the 512 GB SSD.\n3. There is a space for an HDD but it doesn't come with the SATA cable installed, the SATA cable will need to be purchased separately to install a hard drive within the laptop.\n4. The laptop comes with WI-FI 5 and not WI-FI 6 unlike last years version. The WI-FI card is upgradable if you need WIFI 6.\n5. The internal battery can also be upgraded to 70 Whrs version. However note that if you do upgrade, it will occupy the HDD slot aswell.\n\nLink to Lenovo's Spare parts website of this model. [IdeaPad 5 ALC05 Type 92LN Spare parts](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/in/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/5-series/ideapad-5-15alc05/82ln/parts/display/compatible)\n\n**Battery life estimates from 100 percent battery (70% brightness):**\n\n1. Watching movies (Chrome with 5 extensions - 1 tab open, discord, telegram, anydesk, Battery saving mode active from Vantage software, Better battery saving mode in windows.) - 9hrs\n2. Moderate Multi tasking (Listening to music, actually using chrome, discord, qbittorrent (downloading) and a bunch of other background programs, Battery saving mode from Vantage software, Better battery saving mode in windows.) - 6 to 7 hrs\n\n* Note: I use my laptop on conservation mode all the time so it charges only to 60%. The battery life is based on the time it take to drain the laptop from 60% to around 30% and multiplying that by 3.\n* The conservation mode is not customizable. Its either 60% charge or 100% charge.\n* Also, I absolutely love the conservation mode, ~~no other brands have this~~ Asus and Dell also have it according to the internet. My laptop remains on the desk most of the time so I don't have to worry about it remaining on 100% all the time.\n\n**Fans (In an air conditioned room)**\n\n* On Battery- The laptop fans are completely off when watching movies. They may or may not turn on when multi tasking.\n* Plugged in- The fans only turned off when set to Battery Saving Mode in Vantage and doing light tasks.\n* Fans are inaudible (if they do turn on) when doing basic tasks in a room with air conditioner running, only slightly audible with the air conditioner off.\n\n**iGPU**:\n\n* Out of the 16gb ram, 2GB is dedicated for the iGPU, this can be changed in BIOS to 1GB or 512 MB.\n\n**Lenovo Power Management modes:**\n\n* Extreme Performance- TDP is 35 Watts.\n* Intelligent Cooling- TDP is 25 Watts.\n* Battery Saving Mode- TDP is 15 Watts.\n* On Battery, change to best performance (windows) and these modes function the same as plugged in.  I did notice that Battery Saver Mode (Vantage) turns on the fans later than the Intelligent cooling mode which is I guess nice if you're trying to save battery.\n\n**Performance Benchmarks (Plugged in)(Extreme Performance):**\n\n* **Cinnebench R23**\n   * Multi Core **-** 9655 points, 3.65 GHz across all cores, Max: 85 C, Power: 35 W\n   * Single Core **-** 1245 points, 4.3 Ghz single core, Max: 70 C, Power: 10 W\n* **Crystal DiskMark-** 2481 MB/s Read, 1726 MB/s Write\n\n**Performance Benchmarks on battery:**\n\nThe laptop can achieve full performance on battery as well, change from Better Battery mode to Best performance mode in the Windows battery settings.\n\n**Note:** On battery, Better Battery (and Battery Saver) mode locks the CPU at base clock of 1.8 Ghz to get maximum battery life. While using this mode, I did not suffer any hanging when doing casual tasks, (Web browsing, YouTube, Discord etc.)\n\nIf you wanna know something else about it. Please let me know. I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.\n\n* EDIT #1: Added Benchmarks.\n* EDIT #2: Photo of the internals. [https://imgur.com/a/5WCUKW4](https://imgur.com/a/5WCUKW4)\n   * Disassembly video from YouTube (not the exactly same model): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKF\\_9L1qfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKF_9L1qfY)\n* EDIT #3, #4: Added battery benchmarks, then deleted them because I tested them on Better battery mode which locks the clock speed to 1.8Ghz.\n* Edit #5: Cleaned up the post.\n   * Update as of 8 Sept 2021: I have been having some weird touchpad problem. [Details here](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-IdeaPad-1xx-3xx-5xx-7xx-Edge-LaVie-Z-Flex-Notebooks/Touchpad-sluggish-Latency-Lag/m-p/5095310). This has not been fixed after a touchpad replacement so currently working on it. The issue does seem isolated to just me though.\n* Edit #6: Update as of 16 Oct 2022: The hinge is shit quality, it has broken twice till now in the exact same manner with completely normal use.",
  "I can confirm that the hinge quality is garbage. I use mine almost entirely at home, after 2 years of use I have used it no more than 30 times outside. I very rarely open and close the lid when I use it at home because I can sense right from the beginning the hinge quality is not the best although I did not expect it to be this bad. And yet the hinge broke! Together with the LCD!\n\nI paid RM170 (around 39 USD) just to get the one time on site repair because they said repair at the depot would take around 2 weeks time and I had no spare laptop. The basic, send in to the depot warranty covered the spare parts, luckily. So if you guys are planning to buy this model, **do consider to upgrade to the onsite warranty to 3 or 4 years** (depending on how long you plan to use the device). \n\nThe technician who came even told me this model and the model 3 are plagued with this problem. 7 and thinkpads fair better. I wish I'd known.\n\nPerformance wise, it is amazing. Still running strong after two years. (I open many tabs on Edge daily, at times 30-50 tabs, rarely any hiccup.) i5 11 gen, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Heat management is superb as well. It heats up but never overheat, not once.\n\nCheers,  \nR.",
  "Thank you for the review! This is by far the most comprehensive one I've read about this laptop as it's just been released.\n\nI have a few questions-\n1. Do you notice a significant drop in performance (general multi tasking) when on battery vs plugged in?\n2. Does the 100% screen brightness hold up in well-lit rooms or under the sun?\n3. How was the initial set-up process like? Did you install any specific programs/drivers that helped?",
  "Thankx for the review, based on it I will no more 'struggle' with choosing a new laptop from Lenovo, I got a bit scared haha. I'm gonna carry on with my HP's. They have not failed me yet, and I have been happy with performances so far. :)",
  "**Beware: Major Touchpad Problem**\n\nI bought a Lenovo Ideapad Silm 5 laptop in Aug 23, and I thought all is well until a few months in. My touchpad stopped functioning but thankfully, the onsite warranty allowed me to change my motherboard. A few months down the road, the same issue arose, and I was told by the customer hotline to undergo numerous upgrading of software, restarting of laptop, etc, and the touchpad would mysteriously function after a months/weeks until it breaks down again. This laptop is reaching its 1 year mark, and the same issue still persists. It has been a major inconvenience, especially since a mouse cannot entirely replace the functions of the touchpad (i.e. pinching in/out to enlarge the text). To my dismay, I was told by the onsite warranty engineer that the touchpad issue is rampant in laptops of this particular model. I asked for an upgrade of my laptop or replacement of another model, but I was told that this was not Lenovo's usual practice. Am still monitoring the issue after the engineer has replaced the touchpad (for second time), but if anything, **please do not purchase this model** unless you are willing to forgo its touchpad.\n\nTrust me, their onsite warranty they provide is not worth in exchange for your sanity if you were to constantly experience the same issue. The warranty team somehow does not understand what \"intermittent issue\" mean, and they'll put you through the arduous process of troubleshooting and restarting, only for you to find yourself back to square one.\n\nP.S. My USB ports were also not working, but it's fixed atm.",
  "hey, nice review, i bought same laptop and it seems windows media player is lagging, like not working. it's playing like 1 sec of 1min video and it takes ages to load, i tried rebooting or reinstalling from settings but keeps doing same thing, i cant play audio nor video with media playyer, so now i am using vlc media player, any1 have a fix for that?",
  "Why, kind sir, did you decide on the 15 in version instead of the 14 in? Was there any other reason than personal preference?",
  "Omg, Thank You soo much for posting this review!!\n\n\nI am unable to decide between this Ideapad and the Legion 5 with 4600H as both are very similarly priced. \n\nCould you tell me what price did you buy this at? Cause right now, it is 68k INR. And is it worth the price?\n\n\nHow is the cooling on this laptop? Does it heat up under medium-heavy loads? Especially without air conditioning.\n\n\nDoes it stutter or lag a bit when you launch an app or open a web browser or type? Especially when on battery?\n\n\n\nI tried the Intel model for the Ideapad which apparently uses the same body and parts as the Ryzen 5700U model. I did not find the keyboard and the touchpad as good as I was expecting (but I could be wrong cause I only tried it for a few seconds). \n\n\nIs the battery replaceable/ easily removeable by the user? Or does one have to take it to a service center?\n\nI was also considering the HP laptops with Ryzen 5500U but the 15in (my preferred screen size) has a TN panel while the 14in does have IPS but is glossy (I need antiglare so it doesn't strain my eyes).\n\n\nThe Ideapad 5 and Legion 5 just seem so much better.",
  "Hey OP, can you tell me how much did it cost(INR) and where did you bought it from? Good review BTW!",
  "Bro did you figure out what's the part no for the sata kit? To add sata drive?",
  "Hey OP, where were you able to purchase this from? I'm looking for an offline store to pick it up but just can't find it anywhere. \n\nAlso, now that it's been like 70 days since the post, how's the laptop holding up? I'm really looking forward to picking this up and it seems to be the best at this price point",
  "Hey OP, can you post your battery performance report  over here ?",
  "Hi OP thanks for the review! \n\nHowever I have one doubt (please forgive if it is silly), can we add a sata SSD instead of HDD in the HDD slot?",
  "Is it advisable to buy this laptop now or has similar equally priced new laptops have been released?\n Thanks for the detailed review though",
  "Valuable information my friend, I have a similar laptop but the Pro series. Would I see a major difference in battery drain and temperature, if I turn on Extreme Performance in BIOS but Balanced mode on Windows?\n\nAlso, does it make any sense to do this for gaming purposes? Because if you're going to play while the system is AC wired the TDP would be higher than 25W anyways, am I right?",
  "[deleted]",
  "Thanks for the updates, especially on the hinge issue.",
  "I have a two-months-old Ideapad 5 15ABA7 which has exactly the same design as previous model and I'm worried about the hinge even though it comes with 3yr warranty",
  "Hi,\n\n1. The performance drop is not noticeable doing casual tasks on battery vs plugged in. Tried loading web pages and video playback. 4k60fps video playback is smooth on both. \n2. 100% screen brightness definitely holds up in a well lit room, I cam easily manage at 70% brightness in my room. This is probably the best you'll get in this price range, most competition only offer 250 nit screens while this is a 300 nit screen.\n3. Set-up process is pretty classic for windows. The only bloatware was McAfee which I promptly uninstalled. I found once that Lenovo Voice assistant was using 50% of the CPU (it may be updating), so uninstalled that as well. As for driver updates, Lenovo Vantage software is great, check for system updates and install the updated audio drivers from there.",
  "Please check EDIT #4, there was an error in performance test on battery.",
  "I didn't really have a preference, absolutely wanted to get 16GBs of RAM but the 14 inch version only offers 8Gb of soldered memory. There is only a 200g difference between the two, so didn't make a difference.\n\nPlus the extra HDD slot might be a nice benefit in the future.",

It randomly gets an input delay when using it.

I have already gotten a touchpad replacement but the issue didn't get fixed. So still working on it.\n\nApart from the touchpad issue which I randomly get, everything else is completely fine.",
  "Yes SATA SSD can be used as well. Internal Sata cable doesn't come pre-installed. You'll need to go to service center to purchase and get it installed.",
  "IdeaPad 5 is still a good option for 68k. \n\nApart from this, Asus K15 Oled with 5500U, 8GB seems like a sweet deal at 58k on Flipkart during sale. Downsides would be 8Gb of RAM and a 42Whr battery. The ram is expandable to maximum of 12 or 16 gb idk. If you can look past the smaller battery, it has a freaking Oled. You might be able to get some extra battery life by using dark mode because of the Oled display.",
  "No need to go into BIOS to change performance mode, you can just change them from within windows with Lenovo Vantage. Or press Fn+Q\n\n***About the second question:-***      \nWhile AC is connected windows power modes don't really do much so you can ignore them. Between the three windows power modes there is very little difference in terms of CPU power usage (maybe 1W difference between each mode).\n\nBIOS performance modes behave exactly the same both on battery and AC. Which means TDP limits will be the same on both AC and battery. Which means if the game demands more than 25W sustained power, Intelligent cooling mode will limit performance.\n\n***About the first question:***\n\n**Under low load:-**   \nThe difference in battery life will only be caused by the fact that extreme performance mode likes to enable the fans even under very light load.\n\n**Under moderate load:-**    \nThere should be no difference for battery life and heat output in between the different BIOS power modes or windows power modes.\n\nThe reason why low and moderate load don't cause significant differences in battery life between the different power modes because the CPU only uses as much power as it needs, it is not going to consume more power if the program itself doesn't require it.\n\n**For heavy load:**\n\n**If using better battery mode (windows):**    \nThere should again be no difference in between any of the BIOS power modes.\n\n**If using better performance or best performance mode (windows):**     \nThere will be lesser battery life and greater heat output in Intelligent cooling mode compared to Battery saving mode. The difference would be greater in Extreme performance mode. However, you will also be getting better performance.",

  "What do you think of lenovo ideapad flex 5 (ryzen 7 730u) Hello, I am in need of a laptop and I have this sweet deal (650 bucks) for lenovo ideapad flex 5, that comes with ryzen 7 730u, I was wondering are these laptops any good? And is this cpu okay for a laptop this size? The reason I am asking is because I found little to no reviews about this specific version of laptop. If this is a bad deal, do you have any other suggestions? Thanks in advance!!!!",
  "I'll just speak to the CPU.  The 7730U is a rebranded 5825U which is a rebranded 5800U.  Zen3 8 core, 16 thread CPU with Vega8 iGP.  The CPU itself, while maybe not able to keep up with the latest generation of Intel Core Ultra 7's, and Ryzen 7's is still EXTREMELY powerful.  And manages to actually be very efficient while doing so (actually being more efficient than the Phoenix (zen4) cores that replaced it).\n\nThe iGP was once the gold standard of mobile iGP's.  This has long since stopped being true.  It's not a truly BAD iGP still, but will be insufficient for AAA gaming if that's something you want to do.  It should be perfectly fine for older games, most Indy games or esports titles, however.",
  "An igp is intergrated graphics right? If so do you have any suggestions of better alternatives? Thank you very much for the help you have already given!!!",
  "Depends how good graphics you need.  Find something with the 6800U/6850U/7735U and the iGP goes from Vega8 to RX680M, which is more than double the performance level while still being integrated.  Get a 7840U/8840U or Intel Core Ultra 7 (H class, not U) and it goes up to RX780M or Arc Xe 8 respectively, which is even higher performance for an iGP, being essentially on par with discrete RTX 2050 or GTX 1650.  If you want higher than that, you're (currently) going to have to get something with a discrete GPU.",

([https://www.newegg.ca/ideapad-82xf000xus-workstation/p/1TS-000E-164R6](https://www.newegg.ca/ideapad-82xf000xus-workstation/p/1TS-000E-164R6) & [https://www.newegg.ca/blue-lenovo-82xy002jus-everyday-value/p/1TS-000E-16ZA0](https://www.newegg.ca/blue-lenovo-82xy002jus-everyday-value/p/1TS-000E-16ZA0)). Didn't search for any review yet but the spec seem kinda attractive, I wonder what the screen quality is. I'm just a little bit reluctant because I had a bad experience with a Lenovo laptop.\n\nLastly there is the Asus Vivobook 15.6 i5-1135G7 12GB ([https://www.newegg.ca/p/1TS-001A-09XY7?Item=9SIACBDJXS9517](https://www.newegg.ca/p/1TS-001A-09XY7?Item=9SIACBDJXS9517)).\n\nTell me if you own any of this laptop, know good reviews or have others propositions !",
  "Sager NP8377 Review I was recently in the market for a new laptop when I found this sager np8377 that ticked all the boxes in regards to specs and my budget. Upon searching the internet for reviews I was unable to find any and it made my purchase a little uneasy. I still pulled the trigger and purchased it so here's my review and impression so others may get an idea of what to expect. \n\nSpecs:\nCPU: i7-9750H\n \nGPU: RTX 2070 (non max Q) with ability to switch to intel graphics\n\nHD slots: 2x m.2 with raid support, 1x 2.5\" sata slot\n\nMemory: 2x slots that support up to 3000mhz Ram\n\nScreen: 17\" 144hz 1080p G-Sync\n\nBattery: 66wh\n\nPSU: 230watt\n \nKeyBoard: Per key RGB\n\nIO: 3x usb 3, 2x usb C, Headphone and Mic Jacks, Display port, HDMI port, sd card reader, thunderbolt port.\n\nChassis: Screen Aluminum top plate, plastic screen facing, Main body Aluminum top plate, plastic bottom cover.\n\n\nThe overall feel of the laptop is quite nice. It does have flex on the keyboard more than I've noticed on any other laptop I've owned. The speakers are pretty loud but can be a little distorted. The screen is very nice. The specs are awesome. Out of the box the laptop's thermals are meh, but will require tweaking with throttlestop and msi afterburner to stop in game throttling. Power limits are constantly being hit unless tweaking takes place. \n\nMy settings so far are as follows.\nCPU: 3.8ghz on all cores with 90.8mv undervolt on cpu core and cache (still tweaking and testing for further undervolt) this yields very nice thermals of max 78c with an average of 65c under load playing games for 4+ hours.\n\nGPU: locked to 787mv at 1690mhz with +300mhz on memory with afterburner. Max temps are 69c with an average of 62c. No more power limit throttling. \n\nThermal paste is stock.\n\nI added my own memory for a total of 32gig dual channel at 3000mhz. This gave me about 5-10 higher fps VS the stock single channel 16gig 2666mhz memory. \n\nThe laptop will choke itself and overheat unless its propped up or put onto a cooling pad because the pads under the laptop do not provide enough clearance for propper airflow. The fans with stock settings sound like jet engines but once the laptop is tweaked it becomes very quiet.\n\nGaming on it is very nice. My previous Asus laptop had a gtx1070 non max Q and the rtx 2070 non max q absolutely demolished it. On average I'm seeing minimum 90fps with max to high settings on Elite Dangerous, Modern warfare, Ark Survival, Squad, and a few others. My 1070 would barely hit 60fps in those games. \n\nMy overall impression is very good and I'm happy with the purchase. If you understand how to tweak the settings using 3rd party software and add a few things then this laptop is for you. Otherwise I would stay away because it will power limit and overheat leading to constant stuttering. \n\nPictures of chasis and internal comming soon.\n\nI will continue to update this post as I go.",
  "Wow, I have been looking for so long for a detailed breakdown of this computer (this is the PB71 RF-G, correct?)\n\nBasically tell me every complaint and compliment you have about this laptop? I've been struggling to decide between this and the GE75 which also looks great but it doesn't have gsync and the more I investigate, the more I am interested in that feature.\n\nCan't tell you how grateful I am to find some information on this. So hard to find anything on this laptop online",
  "Glag I could help and provide some insight. My only complaint is that the keyboard has a bit of flex but honestly its not a big deal for me. The thermal throttling and reaching power limits are to be expected from any modern laptop and where this one shines is that its cooling solution combined with undervolting the cpu and gpu provides the best thermals I've yet to see on any laptop with stock thermal paste. As for G-sync it is absolutely necessary in my opinion. This allows the rtx 2070gpu to output its full potential without sacrificing performance. A non G-sync laptop will always see less fps and performance. The NP8377 allows you to switch between using the rtx2070 for gaming and the intel gpu for better battery life while mobile. When you're paying for a top brand GPU a non G-sync laptop just doesn't fit the bill. As for the exact model number you mentioned I'll need to confirm and get back to you. All in all im extremely pleased with my choice especially because the price point of $1700 is wayy to sweet to pass up. Just make sure to get a coolong pad, extra stick of ram and be prepared to tweak the cpu and gou with throttlestop and msi afterburner.",
  "excellent stuff! I've confirmed that this is the PB71RF-G too so you may want to include that in your post solely because I've come across numerous people looking for some reviews of this Clevo. I guess my only remaining question is how hard is it to open the computer up? I saw something that indicated it involved taking out around 20 screws and removing the keyboard\n\nhttps://www.notebookcheck.net/Eurocom-Nightsky-RX17-Clevo-PB71RF-Laptop-Review.426428.0.html",
  "Ah yes, I forgot to mention that opening it up is a bit of a pain the first time around if you have no directions like i did. \n\nYou will need to start off by getting a small screw driver and a plastic prying tool. First start by removing the screws that hold the battery and then remove the battery. Once the battery is removed make sure to press the power button a couple times to dispel any remaining voltage in the laptop's circuits. Then begin to remove all of the bottom cover screws. Once all the screws on the bottom are removed you will need to pry the keyboard using the plastic pry tool by STARTING FROM THE MIDDLE TOP OF THE KEYBOARD closest to the screen. It is extremely important to start from the top of the keyboard and work your way to each side. Its way easier than it sounds but only if you start from the top. There is only one screw that needs to be removed and it's located near the shift and Z key. I did not need to unhook the ribbon cable to acces the screw just be careful not to pull to hard on the keyboard while you do this. Once that final screw is out the bottom cover will come off granting access to the internals. A good pro tip is to leave that final screw out once you put the keyboard back in place so you no longer need to remove the keyboard to remove the bottom cover. The total numner of screws is around 12 give or take a few.",
  "you end up tweaking your setting any more?",
  "Yes, I was able to get a stable -125mv at 3.8ghz on cpu and 787mv at 2135mhz on the gpu. Temps average around 75c cpu and 64c gpu. Most games are averaging 110fps at max to high settings. If i drop the graphics a little I'm able to hit the full 144 fps to match my screens 144hz refresh. I'll be adding liquid metal to see if i can push my cpu to 3.9-4.0ghz  with that 75-80c target. Right now if i push 4.0ghz temps reach 92-96c and thats too hot for my taste.",
  "Hey been following this thread for a bit since I got the same Sager as you did and I'm looking to maximize its potential. Any chance you could screenshot or describe your exact settings (what boxes are checked etc)? I've been following the guides out there and I think I've got it set up but if I could see what someone who knows what theyre doing like you has done that would really help me out. Thanks for what you've already posted though!",
  "you'll have to pardon my ignorance here but how would you go about pushing 4.0 ghz? Does that mean just decreasing the undervolt?",
  "Sure, I just got to work so I'll upload the pics sometime tomorrow.",
  "No worries. To push 4.0ghz i need to increase my thermal dissipation. As it stands when i set my cores to 4ghz i reach temps in the mid 90c range. I like to be in the mid 80c range instead.",
  "awesome, appreciate it",
  "like the other poster said, any chance you could post some screenshots of your settings? I've been focused on throttlestop recently because even though I feel like I've followed the instructions I've read online, I'm still getting throttling when I'm doing stress tests",
  "I've been tinkering around with throttlestop and with a -.125 undervolt I've been getting cpu temps of 65-68ish at 3.9ghz playing gta v at max settings for an hour or so. I bought my computer with liquid metal and thermal pads though. Would still love to see your settings though if you are still down to do that.",
  "Oh man I totally forgot to post those pics. I'll get them on in about 4 hours from now. I'm half way through my work shift. If you want help sooner send me the pics of your set up and ill tell yah what to change around.",
  "The ASUS Flip 13 UX363EA (OLED, Core i5 Intel 11th GEN) - Actual user review, no technical BS Okay. So I'd been considering this laptop over the MBA M1 because they were same prices and ended up getting this one - the ASUS Flip 13 UX363EA.\n\nI WILL NOT compare the two laptops in this review because all the comparisons is pointless, like apples and oranges. I will just share my experience with this products after 1 month of use.\n\nOVERALL IMPRESSIONS: the laptop is extremely lightweight, has amazing OLED screen, sturdy, performs fairly well consider the small form factor, the pen support (with included pen) is a very nice feature to have since I am an architect.\n\n1. THE BUILD:\n   1. The laptop is very sturdy, I accidently hit it with other things while moving around a couple of times but there is barely not a dent. There are almost no flexing anywhere, the hinges are firm and smooth, the screen with not move the laptop around, unlike the UX325, you can open the screen easily with one hand, the transitions in 360 degree mode is very smooth and does not feel like anything is breaking at all lol.\n   2. The materials are nice, although I do not like the sharp corners and edge, it is not comfortable with you hold the laptop or using it in tablet mode.\n   3. The keyboard are nice, it has good travel and the keys are firm and feels good but due to the small size of the laptop, it takes a while to get used to it and make less mistake while typing.\n   4. The touchpad with calculator function seems nice but not very practical because most of the time you open the calculator app with in the app is opened under other apps so you have to bring it up to use it,  but kudos for anyone who finds it useful. Besides that it is a very good mouse pad, good palm protection, good and accurate tracking, comfortable to use and reasonably big enough.\n2. THE SCREEN:\n   1. This is the first time I experience an OLED screen on a laptop and this is the main reason I get this product out of the two mentioned. All of my experiences with laptop LCD screens so far was terrible, I always get some kind of brighter spots on the screens after awhile, even with premium laptops like the Dell XPS 15 or Surface Pros. To be honest, IT IS AMAZING. The colors, the contrast, deep blacks... draws your eyes into the screen and just makes you want to use the laptop more. The screen is stated highly for color accuracy but I have no idea how to rate it. It is very bright too, at about 50% brightness, you can use the laptop comfortably in a well-lit room during daytime, at 80% it is usable outside under sunlight.\n   2. There are some cons, too (surely): Windows handles HDR TERRIBLY, the SDR colors become washed out and looks dark, so best option is to turn it off; If you watch a fairly low quality videos in a dark room, you will experience something called black crushing. This a a commonly know thing for OLED screens and it is due to the compressions of videos.\n   3. About the durability of the screen, people are worried about the burn-ins of the OLED screens. There are things I'm saying here that would ease your minds: ASUS is offering 2-year International Warranty for this product so you're safe in 2 years time. Plus, Samsung is the one who makes this panel for ASUS and I have NEVER had any issues with Samsung AMOLED screens on phones since the Galaxy S3 (I have always uses the Galaxy lines since), so it is somewhat an ease of mind. There are options on windows you can use to protect the screen also, like auto-hide the task bar, using dark themes, not using max brightness often, leave every screen protection options on MY ASUS app on...\n3. THE PERFORMANCE:\n   1. Okay, now we're talking. A laptop with nice screens and all but without a reliable performance it is nothing but trash. Luckily, it might take a long time for this computer to actually goes to the trash.---The performance is good in my experience, it starts up fast, under 2 seconds after you open the lit and it is ready to use. It performs all of my regularly used software effortlessly. Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketchup Pro, Mixcraft Studios, AutoCAD, Blender... runs smoothly and fast. I would not use this laptop for heavy work like renderings or video composing though since it is a laptop (who would seriously work professionally on a ultrabook laptop?) but opening files to check and show to clients is out of the question, very convenient.\n   2. Gaming on this laptop just exceeds my expectations. Surely you won't be blasting off demons with double barrel shotgun at 60fps in Doom Eternals but most games I tested runs fairly well at 720p (not so bad considering the screen is just 1080p). Age of Empire 2 DE, DOTA 2, FIFA ONLINE 4, DIABLO 3, Leagues of Legends, Little Nightmares, Rockets Leagues, XCOM 2... runs at 60fps with decent settings and other AAA games like The Witcher 3, DOOM Eternals, Resident Evil 2 remake, GTAV... can run at 30fps which is playable with low settings... you get the ideas.\n   3. Thermal performance is good, there are many people complains about the computer runs hot out of the box, it is because Windows upgrading a lot of thing in the background when you first boot it up, it gets normal after all of the updates are installed. I have not been experienced any thermal throttling during my first month. With balance settings on performance and fan control, the laptop runs idle and light use at about 38-42C and the fan rarely kicks in which is good considering my country is so hot. Under load, it have not reached 80C on me and still usable on lap. The fans are very quiet, I can barely hear the noise even in my bedroom, in the middle of the night. I am very impressed with the thermal performance of this computer.\n4. THE BATTERY LIFE:\n   1. So far so good, the laptop is Intel EVO certified that means it should last about 9 hours in regular use. BUT, life is not what people says on papers. Under normal use, with everything I need installed, the computer lasts around 5 hours for me but please note that I limit the charge to 80% and will not continue to use the laptop if the battery is under 10%. It just my things to protect the battery. So a full battery should carry you at least another 1.5 hours more. It is still very good considering windows laptops battery have ALWAYS been bad on my. My Surface Pro 6 was barely hit 4 hours of use with full charge.\n   2. There are things you can do to improve the battery further though, like using dark modes and dark wallpapers (OLED screen blessings), set the fan control to Whispering mode and turn on battery saver if you just use the laptop for light tasks.\n5. SO... SHOULD YOU GET IT? Well, it depends entirely for what you want to get out of your laptop. For me I would recommend this laptop if you:\n   1. Want an OLED screen on a decent laptop\n   2. Hate Apple but still want similar performance to a macbook air\n   3. Have to use Windows but really want a lightweight and versatile laptop\n   4. Love drawing.",

  "Need Help Deciding Between These 2 Convertible Laptops! Hey there,\n\nI am currently looking for a 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop for University. My Budget is about 800€ and I am in the German Market.\n\nI now found two very good options and really can't decide between them, especially as they are equally priced for me (I will get 15% off on the Acer). I hope you can help me (sorry that the links are in German, but I guess you'll get most of the specs):\n\nOption 1 is the **Acer Spin 3** SP314-54N-53GH. It has an Intel i5-1035G4, Intel Iris Plus Graphics, 16GB RAM and 1TB of SSD storage. Connectivity-wise it has Bluetooth 5, Wifi ax and a Thunderbolt 3.

It has an AMD Ryzen 7 4700U Octacore, AMD Radeon RX Vega 7 Graphics, 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM. I guess connectivity-wise it has Bluetooth 4.2 and does not seem to have Wifi ax or Thunderbolt, just a USB Type 3. With this one I would have to buy a Pen, which would cost me extra.

Storage space is really not important as I will mainly save documents and presentations on it. I don't game on it so I don't really care about Graphics Performance. I do care about battery life, as I often take it with me and it should be able to survive a full University day.\n\nAs they are both new Models it is super hard to find Reviews on them so I'll have to rely of the Specs and on you I guess. I hope you can give me something to make the decision easier for me. Thanks a lot!",

Everything else seems to work fine. The battery is small though. 45Wh only (I get around 3.5 - 4hrs of battery under light usage). You can try for IdeaPad slim 3 with r7 8840HS. It has a 60Wh battery. Or IdeaPad slim 5 gen 10 with ai 7 350. The processor and battery combination in this one is deadly (and so is the price). 55k\n\nI think this would help you in picking up a good battery life laptop hopefully.",

  "Need a laptop for work! Deciding between Acer Aspire 5, Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 and Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge I work mostly from home and I have an iMac which I use 90% of the time. I had an iMac air (from 2016) which I took to meetings, did presentations with and worked on whenever I wasn’t at my desk. My laptop recently died and I want to replace it. I don’t have the budget to replace it with another iMac laptop, so I’m looking at different options. I need it to use Microsoft Office, Teams calls, OneDrive, downloading and uploading videos, occasional photo or video editing (I do most of this on my desktop compute but it would be nice to have a backup), presentations, AirTable. ChatGPT recommends Acer Aspire 5 for the price, but in worried it would be too bulky for me. Since I use it on the go I would prefer something more portable. I found these around the same price range. Any insight or feedback? The price in the images are in Canadian dollars.",

  "The Snapdragon is actually the best option here assuming you don't use anything that doesn't run on ARM. \n\nIt really depends on what you're doing.\n\nThe Snapdragon won't run video games super well, so really depends on your use case. \n\nI would need to look at benchmarks to know the difference between the Intel and the AMD in this case, but I generally lean towards ryzen.",
  "Do not buy any Snapdragon laptops. They do not support software. So avoid the Samsung.\n\nThe Lenovo has a little old CPU. It's definitely not worth 650.\n\nThe Acer is the best option here. You get a powerful CPU, and RAM is a minimum amount for the laptop to run well as multitask.",
  "If you need it for work, forget these 3 and look for a used Lenovo Thinkpad T-series for this price.",

  "Bought the Snapdragon X Plus variant of the Ideapad Slim 5 for ₹56K—Here’s My Review ",
  "# My Experience (1 Week of Use)\n\nSetting up my workflow was a breeze. I’ve built projects using **Go and Docker**—no issues at all. Also used it for **note-taking, reading/editing PDFs, watching movies, and listening to music**.\n\nFor the past few days, it hasn't stuttered a bit while running the following **simultaneously for 4-5 hours**:\n\n* **WSL** (running Zellij & Neovim)\n* **Zen browser**\n* **Obsidian**\n* **Docker container**\n* **Syncthing**\n* **WhatsApp**\n* **Discord**\n* ...and much more\n\nI rarely shut down my device (only for updates/restarts), and **it loses just \\~2% charge in sleep mode**. The efficiency of this chip blows my mind.\n\nCompared to Intel & Ryzen laptops at this price, **battery life is unmatched, and performance is either on par or better**.\n\nAll my tools and applications are natively supported, **except Quick Share, which runs fine under emulation**. Also, the **Android-Windows ecosystem is seamless**, and I love it.\n\n#",
  "Got the same laptop and trackpad died within 2 months. Good luck.",
  "I watched a review of similar one from HP half a year ago and it was good only in native ARM apps, for x86 apps it was terrible, emulation did not work as smooth as on Macs. Have you tried x86 apps or they managed to rebuild everything into ARM during last 6 months?",
  "Does it support Hyper-V? If so, can it run X86 guests?",
  "Please provide a link how did  you get it for less",
  "Would you recommend it to a mobile and web developer? I'm using software like visual studio and android studio. Also laravel for some web dev.",
  "mate how is it for learning programming languages, and please share your experience with Python and data analytics software.",
  "# Downsides & Limitations\n\nOf course, nothing is perfect, so here are some quirks I found:\n\n* **No proper Android drivers** – I tried installing a custom ROM via `fastboot`, but the device didn’t show up. No solution yet.\n* **Android development on ARM is still rough** – It’ll take time before things become fully native.\n* **No OS change option** – Coming from Linux, this was frustrating. Snapdragon promised proper Linux support, but that still seems far away. That said, **WSL has been a lifesaver**, and Windows has been surprisingly pleasant for my use case.\n* **Gaming is not natively supported** – I don’t game, but knowing that most games won’t run natively is still a con. Hopefully, ARM gaming support improves.\n\nHonestly, the **biggest con I expected was Windows itself**—I assumed it would be painful after using Linux. But there are **great alternatives for most tools**, and I’ve actually been enjoying Windows. Didn’t think I’d ever say that!\n\n# Final Verdict\n\nFor ₹56K, this laptop is **an absolute steal**. It’s **comparable to a MacBook Air in build quality, performance, and battery life**—but with **more RAM & storage**. I’m really happy with my purchase.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask! 🚀",

Most of the software he might be using is MS Office, zoom/teams for meetings, and mainly a browser for multimedia and all of his stuff. \n\nAnd while this one is giving unmatched battery life without a charger and no lag, while being the same or more powerful than other i5/i7 12th gen devices, i was checking in the 40-50k price range. So this is where my search ends up... now i'm glad that you liked it, and it's good enough for a student to do basic stuff and multimedia.",
  "Did you suggest this laptop for devops",
  "sad to hear that, hope the warranty fixes it",
  "I use everything on native arm version. The only apps that i ran on x86 are obs and quick share but they ran so smooth and didn't cause any error or problem.

  "I recently used this for learning kubernetes. kubectl  worked fine in wsl. Docker ran without any issue with 6 pods, while staying silent and not heating at all  \nThat being said you should check if all of your tool have native support, otherwise it works like a charm  \nEdit- repeated phrase",
  "The last documentation I saw was that you need to have Windows 11 Pro version for Hyper-V then you can enable it in the settings. Then you can only run ARM64 guests not x86 but that's my memory recalled from the time that these Snapdragon Windows laptops were released. IDK how much improvements they added today.",
  "oh  that's assuring to hear. May be i will play some in future",
  "I haven't looked since launch but it sounded like these laptops were similar to phones you need a new build for each laptop. \n\nThat may have changed. I dunno, from reports Microsoft was helping fund these processors with rebates. \n\nThe next line are targeting $600> laptops so should be better value. Hopefully they fix the Linux issues.",

It seems to mostly happen when it's charging. Maybe someone here has an opinion or experiences with the model? I would highly appreciate it, I'm currently thinking about returning it but I had to wait so long to get it and need it for university, so every option I have seems bad",

Battery life is okay I guess as I don't have any previous experience to compare to, it's about 5 hours watching streamed content on web with max brightness and about 8 hours or more of \"normal\" work like browsing websites or writing documents and so on. \nPerformance is solid, no tasks are slow and I don't have to wait for anything. Only gaming I've been doing is CSGO at 1080p on low settings and fps limited to 60 so the laptop dont get too hot to touch. \nScreen is not the brightest but is pretty okay for indoor use.\nI don't use the touchscreen much, but it's working well when I use it. \nThe laptop is great for traveling, it's relatively light and small.\nCharging with usb-c is great feature. I bought charging adapter (60w) so it's now even more portable than the one supplied with laptop itself.\nOnly thing I'm not sure about is if hdmi is working via USB c hub. I got one and when I want to connect monitor through that hub, it's not working and I have to plug it in the notebook itself. But maybe it's just bad hub, idk.\nOverall, great laptop for the money, today I'd maybe buy the version without touchscreen as I don't use it much, but it's great overall.

Just got it returned today (unrepaired) and am taking it to the Costco to be replaced under their 2 year warranty.\n\nIf you have any warranty options I'd start exercising them now",

Although the arc 140T on Ultra 7 or Ultra 9 is superior its not a deal breaker \n\nBuild Quality: Pretty solid its full aluminium with a good amount of ports and 2 fans which keep it cool and when doing regular tasks on battery saver the fans don't even turn on so it feels like an m4 macbook \n\nBattery life: 10+ hours on battery saver (for coding/ media consumption) and 5 to 6 hours on auto while getting 2hrs on high performance tasks (gaming/video editing) This is for 3K resolution and variable refresh rate \n\nSpeakers: pretty mid and doesn't get loud (depends on the video) so unless im in a quiet room i use headphones",

  "Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15ACH6 – A review and upgrade path First, I’ll tell you about myself. Mainly because it could help you decide on getting the same or a similar laptop if you have similar needs to me. I’m a mechanical engineering student. Currently, I use CAD somewhat frequently for college and \\*very\\* frequently for personal use, so a dedicated GPU was pretty much necessary. A decently Good CPU was also needed for simulation work and \\*very\\* amateurish programming. Video and image editing are also hobbies of mine, but I don’t do anything extravagant so they weren’t really a deciding factor. I also love to be dramatic and firmly believe I am a professional writer. I’m not, so if you don’t like that kind of writing, I’ll leave a TL;DR at the end of this post.\n\nSo, the laptop. The IdeaPad 3 Gaming I bought comes with a wired RGB mouse I will probably not use (it’s still in its sealed bag), some very disappointing manuals and guides (I just downloaded the actual ones from Lenovo’s site) and a 135W AC charger. Internally, it has a Ryzen 5 5600H, a single 8 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM RAM clocked at 3200 MHz, one 512 GB M.2 Samsung NVMe Gen3x4 SSD (model is MZ-ALQ512B), a Nvidia RTX 3050 4GB and finally a 15.6” 1080p 120 Hz display.\n\nI actually wanted to do this just because of this next section: Upgrades. I’ve always been a sucker for high-capacity drives, so the tiny 512 GB of space made me feel uneasy every single time I thought about my locally stored movies, TV shows, comics, games… Point is: I wanted to upgrade. Problem was: I read online that only the 2242 M.2 slot (the one with the stock SSD) could reach Gen4 speeds.\n\nI’ve also read only that this thing would NOT work with a higher than 512 GB drive on the 2242 slot. I just ignored that and got a 2 TB Crucial P310 Gen4 drive. FUCK. YEAH.\n\nI found it on Micro Center for sale at $149.99 USD too. This is important because my third-world mind was already going crazy inside that celestial store. I felt like I was dreaming in that GPU aisle. The custom keyboards too???? I loved every single plack-time I spent in there. My dad (we were on a business trip btw) was searching for a USB to VGA cable and they had it. WHAT. Who even needs that? Truly, an ascending and heavenly experience.\n\nAnyways. I was very worried it wouldn’t work. I already have a fully functional 2 TB NVMe and a 1 TB SATA drive on my PC, so if this didn’t work I just wasted half my salary in something I would 100% not be able to sell at that same price. Not to mention, I still needed an adapter. This thing is 2230, and if you remember correctly, the slot only fits 2242 drives. So…\n\nI’ll go over how good it performs now:\n\n* Gaming\n\nIn the very few games I tested, it was a very good experience. I mostly play only old games, so this might not mean much to you, but Bayonetta, Sonic X Shadow Generations and Rocket League ran perfectly fine. In Bayonetta’s case, it ran even better than on my desktop -$1200- gaming PC, which honestly doesn’t mean much since it barely counts as running in that system.\n\n* CAD\n\nThe most important thing to me. It runs flawlessly. And now, we go back to the Crucial drive! I designed the adapters using Inventor 2025 on the base laptop (as in “stock configuration”). The only problem I could name is that, for some reason, it takes Inventor like a whole minute to load the first project. Be it a fully finished model or just a blank file. It’s very weird.\n\nAfter finishing the model and getting it printed, I was ready to see if my dumb ass would be enjoying two whole terabytes of data on his new laptop.\n\n \n\nIt. Worked.\n\n \n\nI was so stupidly happy. And you know what? I haven’t mentioned that I also installed two 16 GB 3200 MHz sticks. EVERYTHING WORKED WITH NO ISSUES. It felt amazing. The trip to Micro Center, the fact that I was actually upgrading a laptop, the excitement I felt going into the Amazon Locker to retrieve my shiny new 32 gigs of RAM… Truly a wonderful experience.\n\nAfter I installed Windows I decided to check both drive’s speeds, just to be sure. Another big discovery for us; 15ACH6 owners. Turns out that if you only have ONE M.2 drive installed, the drive will run at full Gen3x4 speeds. The damn manual says it runs at Gen3x2, but that is almost a complete lie. Thing is, if you install TWO NVMe drives, the speeds get halved, effectively functioning as two Gen3x2 slots. I’ll add the CrystalDiskMark results as pictures if you want to check them.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI’m really enjoying this laptop. It’s a very capable device. I can confirm that it supports up to 32 GB and a 2 TB NVMe drive and would recommend having just one of those installed to maximize speeds.",

Hi, I’m asking for your help to determine if this laptop will be good enough for 5 years of use during grad school. \nIt’s the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Ci5 210H / 16GB / SSD1000 / 14 / Win11 / (83J0001DRK) \nI’ve been struggling with finding the reviews for this exact model, therefore I am asking for your help. \nHere are some of its features: \nCPU Intel Core i5‑210H (14th Gen, Meteor Lake) \nCores/Threads 8 cores / 12 threads \nBase / Turbo Speed 2.2 GHz / up to 4.8 GHz GPU Intel Iris Xe Graphics (Integrated) RAM 16 GB LPDDR5 (soldered) \nStorage 1 TB SSD (M.2 NVMe) \nOS Windows 11 \nBattery 60 Wh\n\nIt’s a 14”, and a light one, which is something I paid close attention to, as my previous laptop was quite heavy. I don’t think that I will be running really heavy/hard programs on it, but I do think that I will probably use it on a daily basis for multiple hours. Thank you in advance!",

  "Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5i or a HP Pavilion 360? Hi so I will be starting university next year and I want a 2-in-1 laptop for taking notes and daily use.\n\nI already searched for many laptops and the best that I managed to found (my budget is £700 max) are the LENOVO IdeaPad Flex 5i 14\" 2 in 1 Laptop - Intel Core i7 and the\nHP Pavilion x360 14-ek1501sa 14\" 2 in 1 Laptop - Intel Core i5. I don't really like HP laptops (that's what most of people say) and since I'm an Asus user lol. Btw I would have loved buying an Asus but the ones I want are really expensive.\n\nI want to know if the Lenovo ideapad flex 5 is better and if it's worth buying if I'm using it for university (I will do science so I will not be using it for programming or something heavy) also I may use it for drawing as a hobby.

  "How good/bad is the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 15 Gen 10? I can get the 15\" IPS model with the Ryzen 5 7535HS and 70 Wh battery for less than 700 euros not choosing to have a OS preinstalled (689 euros instead of 719).\n\nI'm looking for a laptop that got at least a 100 % sRGB color coverage with a good processor and without Numpad, and this Lenovo is what i'm searching.\n\nBut how good/bad is the quality of IdeaPad? Om Reddit i see peoples complains about problems over problems for the previous gens but the reviews for this gen are speaking good.\n\nI will NOT using for work or university but for a more semi-occasional home usage and when i'm travelling for RAW photo editing.",
  "Am not big fan of Lenovo ideapad and i never tried one, I just see one with my friend and it was old and bad, I heard some people talk about the older version of the built quality.\n\nWhat about asus Vivobook S15, i think it come with a 2K, oled display, it will be great for you or buy a used or refurbished MacBook",
  "Also i want to add that i have found also the Yoga Sim 7i Gen 9 with the Core Ultra 155H and 60 Hz OLED display for a extra 50-60 euros.\n\nBut the thing is how bad will be OLED burn-in on this entry level OLED panels?",
  " Hey i just oredered the same model but with an oled panel 165hz for the same price. \n\nI think it should be enough for ur basic needs",
  "The Vivobook is bigger (beacause there is the numpad) and i find it to be way more expensive for the OLED models.\n\nA alternative that i have found is also the Yoga Sim 7i Gen 9 with the Intel 155H and 60 Hz OLED display for 750 euros. \n\nIs the Yoga better than the IdeaPad on a build quality standpoint?",
  "Considering getting this laptop, how’s it holding up? Specifically, how is the build quality? Many thanks",
  "Yoga slim 7i is a perfect option for what you looking for with the price and just watch reviews for it cuz i don't trust the hinges of any 360× laptop",

  "Yes its overall a pretty good laptop especially for the price, i think you wont be  disappointed.",

  "should perform very similar to the gen 9 version with Ryzen 7 8840HS/8845HS, RAM is not soldered and you can have up to 64GB max, and free 2nd ssd slot. \n\nNo idea how good or bad it is for streaming though.",

  "Lenovo bad. HP better? IdeaPad Pro 5 (8845HS) and Yoga Pro 7 (155H) vs Omnibook Ultra 14 (AI 365) Hi everyone!  \nSorry for the click-bait topic. I want to ask about buying HP over Lenovo. In order to make this post more valuable, I'll write down a short review of the Lenovo laptops because I found many people are looking for similar things in a laptop as me. Also including the OLED vs IPS opinion. I'll add 8845HS vs 155H review later.\n\nOriginally, I wrote a long post, but I didn't save it and it got lost. I'll try to make it short this time.\n\n**What am I looking for?**  \nI want a small work laptop that I could also use for my personal things. It should have good CPU, 32GB of RAM and 100% sRGB because I intend to use it for editing photos while traveling. I also wanted iGPU because it's good enough for the tasks I intend to use it for.\n\n**Why I don't want OLED**  \nOLED screen is dominant in the class of laptops I am looking at. And generally it's a selling point of many laptops. I understand why, but it's no good for my use-case.  \nI use a lot of static content Programming/Lightroom/Web and when I am working, I want to use my laptop as a second screen, which means opened browser or a VS Code for extended periods of time. Of course, this is exactly the use-case that's not great for OLEDs. I also went to a local shop and I saw that the OLED screens have a burn in. I understand that the laptops might be there for a long time, but still.. I don't want to limit my productivity to mitigate something that's going to happen sooner or later. Also the eye strain is real. So it's an IPS for me.\n\n**IdeaPad Pro 5 14AHP9**  \nThis was a big step up from ThinkPad E590 I had before. The performance is great. It's even better than 5600X I have in my PC. But I was being worried about the OLED burn in too much in the long run. Otherwise it was a perfect choice for me. \n\nPros:  \n\\- Very good specs  \n\\- Full metal case  \n\\- Good keyboard  \n\\- Good connectivity with 2 USB-C (USB-4), 2 USB-A and a SD card reader  \n\\- 85Wh battery  \n\\- **Quiet**\n\nCons:  \n\\- Very limited customizations  \n  ThrottleStop doesn't support 8845HS, you can't do much in the BIOS, you can't adjust fan curve  \n\\- OLED burn in  \n\\- 240Hz PWM\n\n**Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14IMH9**  \nI was hesitant to choose Intel because I believe AMD is better, but it has a nice IPS display and it fit my requirements perfectly.  \nI don't know if it's because of the Intel processor, but it's **loud.** Every time it get's above 60C, the fans just start spinning for some time. The CPU reaches 38C in the mean time. WHY?. And it happens even while browsing. The fans are also very high-pitched and annoying. The fan curve from Lenovo is terrible and I couldn't change it. It behaves like that in all power modes. Lenovo restricts any customization for some reason. It's very annoying and that's basically the only reason why I am looking for some other options.\n\nPros:  \n\\- IPS with 100% sRGB  \n\\- Very good specs  \n\\- Full metal case  \n\\- Good keyboard  \n\\- Thunderbolt 4  \n\\- 14.5\" display with minimal overall size change  \n\\- Good light use efficiency thanks to E-cores\n\nCons:  \n\\- Terrible fan curve (loud)  \n\\- Power button located on the side means accidental shut downs  \n\\- Only one USB-A  \n\\- Very limited customizations  \n  ThrottleStop doesn't support 8845HS, you can't do much in the BIOS, you can't adjust fan curve\n\n  \n**IdeaPad Pro 5 14AHP9 vs Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14IMH9**  \nBoth look very much the same and I really like the design. Yoga is a bit larger thanks to the 14.5\" display which is better for productivity and you can't really tell when carrying it.  \nThe build quality is better on the Yoga. It has a more premium feeling, but it's really not noticeable. The only noticeable things are the bezel around the screen is glass vs plastic on the IdeaPad. Another thing is keyboard, which is meant to feel more premium on the Yoga. It has a great travel but it's harder to press than on IdeaPad that's why I prefer the IdeaPad keyboard.\n\n**Ryzen 9 8845HS vs Intel 155H**  \nAMD is definitely more power efficient during moderate tasks. I think it's also part of the reason why IdeaPad is more quiet. \n\n**HP OmniBook Ultra 14 (AI 365)**  \nThis is an option I am looking into and I want your opinion on it. It's about 150$ more expensive, but it has a newer ZEN 5.  \nI'll share my cons and pros about this laptop. What I would really appreciate is your experience with the noise. Also if you can do more customizations like a fan curve using FanControl.\n\nPros:  \n\\- ZEN 5 (quiet?)  \n\\- IPS with 100% sRGB  \n\\- More customizability?\n\nCons:  \n\\- Worse design  \n\\- Large bezel (the laptop is the size of Yoga which has 14.5\" vs 14\")  \n\\- USB-C in the corner  \n\\- More expensive  \n\nWhat I ultimately want to achieve (and what is achievable with the IdeaPad) is that I want my laptop dead silent during some light work.\n\nI hope somebody will be able to share their experience and help me decide. I also hope I could help somebody else decide!\n\nThanks!",

At what settings and FPS do you want?** \n \nIf I could play something like Cyberpunk, Ghost of Tsushima on high or greater at 60FPS that would be a dream come true but if it's limiting to a 2/3 hour battery it wouldn't be worth it to me. \n \n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** \n \nReliable build, good keyboard and input devices would be ideal.

  "Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i heat/thermal paste issue Hi all, been having escalating issues with my kid's Lenovo, lots of BSODs, freezing when moved and now it's unusable and dies under any light usage within 2 mins (it ran all bios diagnostics successfully). I opened it up and found thermal paste smeared on the back panel and a little bit on the SSD tray/array. Lenovo support docs and YT teardown videos don't show any thermal paste anywhere...any ideas what's happening? How I could repair? I've ordered some new thermal paste and am ready to go lol. ",
  "I've opened many lenovo laptops, that is not how they should come out of the factory. Have you checked that there is thermal paste on the cpu/chipset? Everything else appears fine.",
  "That isn't paste, that is a thermal pad, that is fine",
  "Ok so I've replaced the thermal paste. Here's a picture of how it was before I replaced it. Unfortunately still crashing. I repositioned the thermal pad on top of the SSD. Air dustered the dust out of the way of the fan. Is there anything else I can do? The ram is soldered on so I can't reseat it or anything. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/Nxf3mrc",
  "No this is the next step. Is it possible for thermal paste to blow out of that area and into SSD and back cover?",

  "For the price you will have to look at your countries offers and if you get some kind of discounts like student discount, that Lenovo offers. \nIs it worth it? Depends on the price and what you need. If you can find a ryzen ai 7 or core ultra 7 256v laptop with good display and the ports you need, for about the same price or 150$ more, that will be the better option. \nI'm really happy with it tho, I use it 10 hours a day for studying and gaming and battery life, display and performance are just great.
