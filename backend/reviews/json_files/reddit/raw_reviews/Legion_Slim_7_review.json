  "ASUS TUF A15, Lenovo LOQ 15 or Lenovo Legion Slim 5 with slightly lower specs? I’m an architecture student, I want a budget-friendly gaming laptop that is strong for renders and 3D softwares, also I don’t own a PS5 or a next-gen gaming console, which might be the case for a long while, so I want a laptop that also performs well in games. I currently have 3 options that I cannot decide between:\n\n1-ASUS TUF A15 Ryzen 7 7735hs RTX 4060 8gb VRAM 1080p 144hz\n\n2-Lenovo LOQ 15 intel i7 13620h RTX 4060 8gb 1080p 144hz\n\n3-Lenovo Legion Slim 5 intel i7 13700h RTX 4050 6gb VRAM 2K display 165hz\n\nThe ASUS is the cheapest, with both the LOQ and the Legion being equally priced. I went to a store and asked one of the workers there about the ASUS and told me so many good stuff about it compared to the LOQ, such as the cooling system and build quality, but watching reviews on this model of ASUS, all comments on it are kinda mixed which makes me scared of getting it, I’m more convinced about getting the LOQ because I heard it has a better display which is something that strongly matters to me. \n\nAs for the Legion, I heard that it’s the BEST budget gaming laptop there is, though considering that it’s gpu is 4050 instead of 4060, it makes me scared of regretting my purchase, since 4060 is significantly better than the 4050.\n\nSorry for all of this text, but I would love some advice, if it is based on personal experience that would be a lot better, but all suggestions are welcome, thanks! :))\n\n",
  "I'd do the LOQ or the Legion in your scenario. I know they're promising to be better but the ASUS support stories still scare the shit out of me. I really wouldn't trust in-store workers on anything, they're just trying to sell you stuff. \n\nMeanwhile I've used Lenovo support multiple times for repairs and full part replacements without problems. The 4060 will be way, way better than the 4050, so the LOQ is the best bang for your buck. I have an LOQ with a 7840HS and a mobile 4060 and it's basically my workstation now as well - it plays all games at high/ultra and doesn't have any problems. Had this for almost a year now with no problems.",
  "Thank you for the suggestion! I’ve been thinking about getting the LOQ too, but I haven’t heard great stuff about the thermals and the build quality. Does the build quality feel cheap? Or is it durable enough? And is the cooling good when playing games?",
  "I just found a legion slim 7 on sale and kind of did an impulse buy. Can anyone shed light of the good and bad of these things? Thank you in advance for the help. If this isn't something you do here I apologize it's just a nightmare to find any decent reviews online.\n\nI purchased a legion slim gen 7 with AmD 6800s and a Rx 6800S 8gb gddr6. It has 1 tb ssd m2 2280 pcie gen 4 tlc storage. 8gb soldered and 8 gb sodimm ram.\n\nThe monitor is a 17\" 500 nit 165 hz LED display. I spent around 1500 all said and done with cooling pad and gaming mouse. Debating getting a keyboard too. \n\nMy question is is this a quality laptop I can run game on their highest settings with no problems? Did I overspend for something I could have gotten $500 cheaper? What would you level of buyers remorse be if you just did what I did? From 1-(Im a complete moron that apparently likes to burn money) to 10-(what a great purchase I made. This is something I can enjoy for years to come regardless of the size of the get I play).\n\nI know this whole thing is dumb but humor me. I can still replace if I need to so I'm just want to cover the bases I should have covered before I spent $1500.\n\nThank you again.",
  "if it plays the games you want to play well, then it sounds like a good buy. you didn’t tell us what you plan on playing/doing on the laptop",
  "I was just going to play some older games. Possibly WoW or Final fantasy MMO.\n\nIf I wanted to play a game like elden ring I have to see if I could play it max graphics",
  "If you branch into games like Elden Ring, you'll start to see the value of the more powerful graphics card. for the others, it's a bit overkill, but that just means you can go longer before upgrading if you mostly play more simple games.",
  "HP victus 3050ti or legion slim 7i 2060 maxq I dont know enough to make this decision on my own, and there are barely any reviews online for the slim 7i. I have been using a HP Victus for the past couple of months, and only had a couple problems with it. the screen hinge is a common issue, the battery is fairly good lasting around 7 hours i would like to say, but sometimes it breaks loose and will last for about 2 and a half hours, the battery percent will sometimes go down 1 percent every minute or so. I dont like how there are no ports on the back for when i dock it and the screen is not exactly colour accurate. From what i know, the tgp is around 75 watts. \n\nThe legion seems like a slight upgrade for me, but im not sure. I think the 2060 in it is slightly more powerful than the one in the Victus (i think a 3050ti is worse than a 2060, im not talking about wattage or variants such as maxq) please advise me if i am wrong though. the processor in the legion is an i7-10750H which under my understanding is slightly LESS powerful than an i5-11400H, also tell me if i am wrong about that.\n\nthe legion has a charging port on the back for easier cable routing for docking, it has a fingerprint scanner (i just think its pretty cool), it has an rgb keyboard (i think), has a better screen that doesnt wobble, is significantly lighter (i take it to school everyday and i dont like lugging around a weight too much), and its very thin. The only problem i can see is that it might get hot as it cant cool properly because of it being thin.\n\nBy the way, i would like the legion to have windows 11, which it doesnt come with, is it bad to upgrade it instead of it being pre-installed?\n\nOh also, the legion supports usb c charging i think which means that even if the battery goes flat, i dont have to lug around a 200 watt charger to school, i could just bring around a light usb c charger.\n\nbasically im asking if i should upgrade(?) to the legion, and if anyone has any extra info on it that i should know. (also if someone could tell me what the battery is like that would be great)\n\nheres the link to the [victus](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/hp-victus-16-1-fhd-144hz-gaming-laptop-intel-i5-rtx-3050-ti?queryID=ec522c28539babb5be3011738398b9a5&objectID=530851), and heres the one for the [legion](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/lenovo-legion-slim-7i-15-6-full-hd-144hz-gaming-laptop-intel-i7-rtx-2060-maxq?queryID=4bc8ebf5275aea41305a81a35cb330ea&objectID=520064)\n\nalso which one do you think looks nicer? i cant decide\n\nThanks everyone",
  "I'd take 2060, 6gb of vram and a 10750 Is more than enough to pair with it\n\nBut it's not that much of an upgrade over yours tbf",

  "Yeah.  \nKnown brand with good hinges, damn beautiful, great components too.  \nIt's OLED too.  \nI'd buy it for sure.  \n\nOP, I think you're either wasting our time or wasting your money, to say so as nicely as possible.  \nThis laptop is everything you need and want at 1k$.  \nYou want RGB? FINE! Get some laptop with worse specs that's marketed \"for gaming\" and see it suck in games.  \nThis one is good for years if you do proper maintenance.(Just like any other laptop).",
  "Yes",
  "i recently bought the legion pro 5i, all those specs except less storage, no oled and it’s 16in. it has 4 zone rgb. It’s an incredible laptop. imo the legion line has the best laptops for its price, honestly i would pay more for it. i’m LOVING it, the gaming performance is impressive. i also thought it looked boring when i saw it online but in person it looks great. My screen isn’t OLED like the version you posted and i still think it’s fantastic. LOVE that most ports are at the back and not the side. just a well designed and powerful laptop, i would highly recommend.",
  "Sorry guys, its 1049.99 US dollars",
  "If it’s usd, seems like a good deal",
  "Yeah that's pretty good.",
  "It's decent, do some looking around to compare price to other websites",
  "Probably would need to upgrade the RAM tho",
  "No",
  "my laptop had a 3060, same cpu and bettet screen and cost 500 more",
  "Specs like this are worth double that in most places of the world so if you question is is it worth buying, then the answer is yes",
  "Looks a decent laptop at that price. Go ahead and buy it if you like it. Number of reviews don't really mean anything. If you're still on the fence, just look it up on YouTube",
  "Do you guys know when is the best time for a laptop discount? Are there specific day for discount?",
  "yolo",
  "Decent",
  "My friend just bought this, definitely worth the money + the screen is beautiful",

  "Its ok",
  "Going off of what I know with the legion brand, I would only say it depends if it's a metal casing or plastic casing.\n\nPlastic casing from my experience just feels cheaper and easier to break. The metal will give a premium feel.",
  "This is in all possibility, really really good. I remember paying similar amount for i7 8th gen 8GB RAM, 128 GB SSD, 1 TB HDD, 4GB 1080 Ti. This was in 2019 though.",
  "yes ofc",
  "hell yeah. I bought a laptop with an i7-10750H and 3060 6gb in 2021 for like 1800$. I'd be more than happy to upgrade to that(ofc I won't cuz I don't have 1050$)",
  "Good deal!!",

  "There is Asus tuf series but lenevo has better build quality and temps so just go with the lenevo",
  "I understand, but if you want RGB you'll likely get scammed. You'll get scammed by thinking it's still worth the price, when this one is worth 1k$, it's the definition of a 1k$ laptop if you ask me.  \nBest damn thing at this price.  \nNow, with this specs, I must ask, are you looking for a gaming LAPTOP, or a PC?  \nThe laptop is underpowered compared to the PC because of the thermals and battery, but the PC lacks much of the portability.  \nGet a laptop if you need it to be portable, not if it's like the 5th criteria on your list.",
  "I own this laptop . Overall, it's great that even Youtuber Jared's Tech also named it the best 14-inch gaming laptop of 2023 . The display is beautiful, the performance is great, and the downside is soldered ram and mediocre speakers\n\nThe other option i considered was the G14 2023 with 4060 and the G16 2023 4060 they were around 1100 ish after taxes",

  "Honestly, I think it could handle everything, maybe not at MAX settings, but at good ones and also reviews don't always mean anything, just because something doesn't have a ton of reviews doesn't mean it sucks,just means not that many like to write reviews or that many people haven't found this laptop yet and people also buy such laptops on other sites as well.",

  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

  "$500 laptop for school? I need to buy a new laptop for school. My budget is only $500, absolutely no higher.\nI don’t need to be able to game on it, I already have a gaming PC and Lenovo Legion Go lol\n\nHowever, I’m a Mechanical Engineering major so I’ll need to be able to run some heavier software like CAD, MATLAB, other simulation tools, etc.\n\nPortability is also a factor because I’ll be taking it back and forth to work with me every day to do coursework in my downtime.\n\nThe only options I can find near me are the ASUS Vivobook with Intel Core 5 120U and the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U. \nBased on reviews online, and especially on a Reddit, I’m scared to pull the trigger on either one now.\n\nIs there a better option that I haven’t found yet?",

  "Hard time choosing a new laptop. So I currently am using a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, and am planning on upgrading because: A) It is not powerful enough, and B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nI am a student and will primarily be using the laptop for school work, so it needs to be portable and a comfortable weight to bring with me to and from class. I love how portable my 13\" Air is. I've done a LOT of research over the past two years, but never bit the bullet, but I feel like now is the time, and so I've committed to buying one now.\n\nMy use cases (in order of importance): School, Music Production, Photoshop, Gaming\n\nI don't play a lot of games but it would be nice to have a machine to play some Civ 6 or even some other, more intensive games like BO2/BO3 Zombies (and MAYBEEEE some RDR2) when I am on a plane for a long time. I want something that's decent on battery life, I don't spend all day at school, maybe 4 hours at most on a given day, so I want something that'll last me that long doing just school work without having to even worry about bringing a charger.\n\nNow, I've looked at like tens of laptops, from gaming to notebook, and I've seen some I've considered like the Zenbook S16, Lenovo Slim 7i Aura, Zenbook 14, Zenbook A14, but I've narrowed it down to a couple:\n\nZephyrus G14/G16 - The clear winner for me, problem is it is just too expensive, and the only models that go on sale into my price range are the 4050 G14 and 4060 G16 models which I've heard may not be worth it. They don't go on sale super often, and the ones that do are open box. (Currently can get the 4050 model for $1499 CAD open box)\n\nZenbook Duo 2024 (Ultra 9, 32GB, 1TB, 60hz 1080p model) - I've toyed with the idea of having this laptop for a while. My PC setup at home has 3 monitors and I absolutely love it, and could see myself getting genuine use out of both screens when writing an assignment, key word being WHEN I am doing an assignment, which isn't an every day thing. I don't think it would be powerful enough to handle any gaming at all. Surprisingly, this is actually cheaper than both the G14 and G16 Models I would be getting. (Currently can get it Refurb-Excellent for $1519 CAD)\n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 15\" - This just came out, and I feel like 15\" is the perfect size for me to be honest. I can get the spec with the Ryzen 7 260, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD (will add another in the future), and a 5060 8GB card for within my price range, around $1750 all in. It's around 4 pounds which is the heaviest of the three, but is also the fastest of the three. It's so new that there isn't a single review yet for it. (Brand new for $1750 CAD, could try and haggle it at Lenovo)\n\nThese are my three ideas right now in terms of what to get. Does anyone have any recommendations? Anyone with these laptops have advice?\n\nI'd not like to spend more than $2000 CAD.\n\nEDIT: In case it wasn't clear, this is not meant to be a desktop replacement; I already have one.",
  "Well you need to be aware of the fact that most gaming laptops have a dedicated gpu they are loud heavy and the battery life is 3hours at best and the performance is ass when on battery .\nSo you’ll want something with a powerful igpu like a Ryzen ai 300 series (the Ryzen 7 or 9 models) or the intel core ultra 200 series ( like the ultra 7 258v) these have the most powerful iGPUs currently available. Also their batter life is pretty good.",
  "Don't buy the Zenbook duo. It's more of a gimmick and not a good choice for your use case. \n\nGaming laptops all suffer from battery life. They always need to be plugged in. They don't last long. \n\nYou might want to get something with a modern AMD Ryzen 8000 series CPU. The integrated graphics are good for some light gaming. These CPU are also power efficient so you get good battery life.\n\nAsus Zenbook S16 and Zenbook 14 should be the models to consider. The models with AMD Ryzen CPUs.",

  "Is this Laptop Good? With Black Friday coming up, I'm planning to buy a laptop with good performance, decent dedicated GPU, 16GB or more RAM (prefer 32GB so that I won't have to upgrade in the near future), and at least 512 GB SSD.\n\nI'm an engineering student + part freelancer and content creator, so the rig will be used for things like: CAD, simulation software, VMs, Video Editing, video conferencing, and recording videos for YT. Emphasis on multi-tasking with other work like coding on an IDE or using Office. **Most importantly, the laptop must run smoothly for at least 5 years** while not getting gen-zoned by future OS updates.\n\nI have been looking around a lot and have found some good choices among ASUS and Lenovo machines (a bit disinclined towards the latter). While doing so, I came across this: [https://progamerstech.com/product/eluktronics-rp-15-g2-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-7840hs-octa-core-cpu-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-gpu-15-6-qhd-165hz-display-2tb-pcie-gen-4-ssd-64gb-ddr5-ram-wi-fi-6e-rgb-backlit-keyboard/](https://progamerstech.com/product/eluktronics-rp-15-g2-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-7840hs-octa-core-cpu-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-gpu-15-6-qhd-165hz-display-2tb-pcie-gen-4-ssd-64gb-ddr5-ram-wi-fi-6e-rgb-backlit-keyboard/)\n\nIt's not a well-known brand so I don't see many reviews anywhere. But it looks like a steal at this price - the specs are leagues above the competition (compare with the Lenovo Legion Slim 5). But that's what's making me skeptic: is there a catch here? Like poor longevity, battery life, or something else? Anyone who has any experience, please give some valuable insight.",
  "It has been my experience that getting 3 years out of a gaming laptop will be a sign of insane good luck.  While it's certainly possible to have one last longer, I haven't seen it happen very often at all.",
  "Why is it so hard to pick a slight gaming/music production laptop for everyday use and just trust and pick a brand I've been going through it when it comes to buying a laptop, or just picking a reliable brand? Does anyone else have similar problems? First I was like Asus is good and Lenovo, then after watching endless reviews quality and reliability can be an issue with Asus, and people are boycotting Asus now for diverse reasons. Lenovo, I agree that they have really nice laptops, but deals are hard to find, I finally found a Legion Slim 7 Amd that had great specs for the price, as I'm about to checkout, it tells me authentification failed. Contacted the bank and Lenovo, the bank saya there's no activity and Lenovo says its the bank's problem. So basically, I've read endless reviews that this keeps happening and I feel like I can't choose Lenovo as I am frustrated from this situation, so I look elsewhere, check for HP or Dell, Dell has good laptops just pretty expensove for the quality, I feel like there's only MSI and HP Omen, but can't seem to make a decision on like the brand's reliability, quality control and other factors that might play into choosing one. I just want to know how do you guys do it? No matter how much research I do, there's always something. Like HP Omen has bad displays for the price, msi is overpriced unless on sale, Best buy sales for Lenovo are just not as good as their website.",
  "Vostro 7510 Review/ Advice Request  \n\nI really appreciated this (and other) reddit when I was searching for a laptop, and wanted to return the favor with a quick review of this laptop. I am not a formal laptop reviewer, and don’t have fancy gizmos to check nits or color accuracy, but wanted to share. I have only been using it for about a day or two, and I may or may not post some updates as I use this more. There’s also some chance that I will return it. \n\nModel: [https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations)\n\n(purchased on sale for $1150 + 10% CB).\n\nI wouldn’t mind some advice from the sub on whether to keep this or return for one of two slightly more gamery computers that will seemingly solve some of the issues I have with this - either the Lenovo Legion 7 Slim or the HP Omen 16.1 AMD (if it gets released on HP’s site soon enough). \n\n**Background:**\n\nI joined a small business and needed a laptop. I purchased my last laptop \\~11 years ago and while it aged gracefully… that's like 85 in laptop years. Business required that the laptop have Windows 10 Pro, and preferred that it have biometric security. I wanted it to be thin, and have good build quality so it will hold up well. I also wanted to be able to play the new AOE when it comes out (i.e., light RTS and 4x type games). Finally, I needed the laptop yesterday so I didn’t have time to wait around for the best deal.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\nI think this laptop falls short in a few ways: (1) it spontaneously shut down the first day I was using it. Enough battery, updated Microsoft drivers, and no indication of why when I turned it back on. Not sure what it was, but I updated the Dell drivers and it hasn't happened again in the few hours of use since that. (2) Battery life could be better, once I was down to less than 40% after about 3 hours of (non-gaming) use (downloading and installing some applications, light browsing). As I type this I have 2:56 estimated remaining at 77% of the battery on “better battery” setting. The battery estimate was also all over the place. I don’t think it’s fair to expect much more out of a 56 whr battery, but I think it is fair to expect more than a 56 whr battery in this kind of laptop. (3) The keyboard is ok - typing feels nice enough, although I liked my old Lenovo’s keyboard a little bit better. The backlighting is a joke. (4) Cooling. I ran Offworld Trading Company, which was free from Epic Games at the time I received this computer, and after less than 15 minutes of play I found the palm rest to be warm, and (using a food thermometer) found the temperature to be over 100 fahrenheit on the speakers, and about 127 fahrenheit right underneath the vents. The fans were noticeably loud as well. Task manager says the GPU got up to 65c. That seemed pretty warm for a few minutes of play on a 5 year old game.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\nThe strengths are in the specs: i7 with a 3050ti, aluminum chassis (there is a very thin plastic bezel around the screen, but it's small enough to get over. Pretty good build quality. Touchpad is spacious. It’s relatively heavy for a 2021 laptop, but it has a dGPU and is pretty thin. Screen is pretty nice and color accurate, although I suspect nothing special in 2021. And I will be able to play aoe4 on this (when it comes out). \n\n**Dell Customer Service:**\n\nI also wanted to call out a good experience with Dell Customer Service. Without getting into the details, they made things right quickly and followed up to make sure things ended up ok. \n\n**Request for Advice:**\n\nWhen I was looking at this I was also between the Lenovo Legion 7 slim which is a few hundred dollars more, but has a higher refresh screen and the 3060. I decided that because I am looking to play RTS/4x games that are typically not AAA graphically intensive, a 3050 would be enough and I would be better saving the money. \n\nI was also considering the new HP Omen AMD 16.1, but it still hasn't been released on HP’s website (where they have frequent 10% off gaming PC sales), and given that I need something now, I may not be able to wait until they can ship it.\n\nNow that I have used the Vostro, and have pointed out the above concerns, do you think I’ll get (a) significantly better battery life on one of those other options, and (b) is the cooling significant enough to cause problems with my use of the Dell?",
  "Just 1 question. Does it have 1 or 2 SO-DIMM memory slots??\n\nOne review said 8GB is soldered. One Dell maintenance manual shows 2.\n\nI'm between this and the 15\" LG Ultra with the GTX 1650 Ti. The Dell has the true full size number pad, but the LG's is the crammed version.  For me this is between soldered ram or not. If 1 is soldered, then I'll have a tough decision. \n\nSo, please pop the back cover and let us know?\n\nThanks!!",
  "I reached out to Dell. They confirmed its 2x SO-DIMM slots that support up to 64GB RAM!",
  "You’ll need to consider whether you want a gaming laptop or not. The Vostro is not a gaming laptop and won’t perform like one. It is a premium build quality well rounded business laptop with top specs. It will get hot when gaming over long periods of time. If you want something with more power you should consider the Lenovo legion slim 7 or if you don’t want a gamery feeling laptop the Ideapad 5 pro 16.",

  "I just got this laptop RTX3050 version, and I have to say, I believe the design around the battery life and cooling system is very poor. I thought mine is broken, after reading similar stories from other owners similar experiences are confirmed. I’m frustrated and disappointed with this product from Dell. The battery needing to be bigger and cooling system larger. IMO it’s flawed heavily. You can’t game on it either, the RTX3050 is very weak. The screen is average. Considered returning it for a different model but I’m too busy at work. \n\nWould not go with a dell laptop again. I could of paid slightly more and got a different manufacturer with better specifications and most likely none of these cooling and battery issues.\n\nSorry Dell, but this product is piss poor.\n\nEdit: ram dota2 as a test, can’t even get more than 30fps avg, 1080p max textures details. My desktop with Radeon RX5700XT and an old 6 core sandy bridgy CPU sits just below 200 avg\n\n30fps avg in an esports game isn’t playable.\n\nEdit2:  it sure what dell were targeting with its design, it can’t go anywhere without its charger very nearby. Poor gaming performance, terrible thermals. That leaves users with an always plugged laptop that only runs word processing applications and runs like a volcano doing it.\n\nEdit3: screen is 60hz. 2021 they release a mid range laptop with this? Dell are you high? Reason I bought it? It was 40% off. I almost got my boss one whilst awaiting shipping. Pretty glad I didn’t get my employer an absolute dud laptop, that seems like dell were trying to offload\n\nEdit4: finally. At work we run all dell emc servers. Lost a lot of faith on dell consumer, and as a whole if they are pulling this kind of crap I n 2021. We are due for a major upgrade, HPE looking much more convincing",
  "So good",
  "I would wonder why the GTX card if not gaming... I mean, the type of computing (ML, linear algebra) I use for work with an Nvidia card is more demanding than gaming.  If it can't handle gaming, then it can't handle a work setting that requires a GPU.  Otherwise, most workers don't need a dedicated GPU for work (with Word, browsing, etc).  Just puzzled, what's the point of providing a GPU that can't handle gaming.",
  "I have one, same specs as OP but regular 3050, not Ti. It has 2x m.2 slots. The OEM ssd is a very short m2 2230 drive. The other M2 slot can take a normal full length SSD. The short OEM 2230 ssd drive is in the longer m2 slot with a weird metal arm to anchor it to the screw down hole at the end. So if you buy one of these you need to move the OEM ssd to the other m2 slot, then stick your full length SSD in the m2 slot you just took the OEM out of.\n\nIt's easy, and already inside the case are the two heat sinks for SSDs. One small copper one for the OEM shorter 2230 ssd, and a full size heatsink for a normal m2 ssd. \n\nEdit: As per my reply to the other guy below, the battery life is absolute ass on this.",
  "I can run the new Diablo 2 resurrected/remaster on this at max graphics no problem, as long as it's plugged in. That game is a little heavier that you would expect on resources. My Ryzen 4800u with integrated graphics can only handle about low medium graphics. So this thing's pretty decent.\n\nDepending on what you're doing, keep in mind the **battery life is horrible** on this thing. I'm getting worse life than OP when just doing very basic light tasks. I get 3 1/2 to 4 hours max. This is with screen brightness low, no USB devices, the 3050 dGPU disabled, and just using a webbrowser. No gaming or streaming. I've done all manner of tests to squeeze out better battery life and have had not luck (OS reinstall clean, different drivers, setting max CPU usage to 30%, etc.). Dell support told me 4 hours is good battery life for this laptop and referred to the battery as a ***backup battery***.\n\nAlso, if you plan to dual boot to linux this thing won't sleep properly. You can set it to suspend, which defaults to s2idle and uses about 14% battery per hour. Manually modifying the system to deep sleep doesn't work properly, it will start to sleep, then spin up the fans and turn on the keyboard light. This is with Nvidia proprietary driver software and the dGPU off and iGPU on. After researching it, lot's of dell notebooks are doing thing. Dell's forums show things like \"this model doesn't support being set to suspend/sleep and put in a bookbag\".\n\nHopefully this info helps. I'm in the process of returning mine. It's a nice enough laptop, but averaging 3.5 hours of battery life from extremally light tasks with my mentioned battery saving attempts is bad, the linux sleep thing is bad too.\n\nIf you'll mostly be on AC power all day, you'll be fine. But if you're on battery it will not last. Gaming will kill the battery even faster, and it will lower its performance dropping the frame rate badly on battery.",
  "Hey I think your laptop may be broken or you are using it unplugged, because a 3050 usually runs dota 2 at around 120fps at the 65W. Do you run dota while plugged in? because it only uses the integrated intel graphics when unplugged which could explain the low fps.",

  "Hey question, are you using windows 10 or 11? I know windows 11 has hit ALOT of laptops negatively in terms of battery life. I’ve heard some people getting up to 4 hours less than they would in windows 10.",
  "To tell the truth I didn’t run it more than a few hours on win10. I did find turning on battery saver made a difference, but it wasn’t major enough. I did also find apps like the brave browser automatically using the dGPU for no reason, setting windows to force it into the iGPU helped a bit.\n\nI did run manjero Linux and was getting batter battery life than when 11, but maybe just an extra 30 mins of light usage.\n\nOver all, I think the battery capacity (56Wh) is just a bit too low for something with an 11800h and dGPU. I tried buying an 86Wh battery from Dell before sending the Vostro back, but they don’t have them in stock.\n\nI moved to a Lenovo P1 G4. That has a 91wH battery, It’s easy to get 4.5-5 hours on that thing without effort.\n\nEdit: more info.",
  "Oh okay thank you for specifying more! Yeah brave turns on hardware acceleration by default for some reason. It’s quite annoying 😂 had a time I was wondering why my laptop fans were spooling up every time I opened brave and was always at a steady 10-30% usage.",
  "Yeah lol, I happened to be looking at task manager and noticed GPU_1 in use with just an empty downloads tab open. Need max power for that.\n\nOther than the battery life, I did really like that vostro.",
  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",

  "Looking for a new laptop. Hi! I'm looking for a new laptop because mine died.\nI looked many options and reviews but honestly I still have no idea because I don't know how powerful I need my laptop to be or if is more important to have more ram or a dedicated GPU.\n\nMy maximum usage would be:\n30-40 chrome tab open and at the same time light Photoshop and InDesign usage, word, VS code and maybe slack or zoom (but not really so often). This is really the maximum. \nI have a surface pro 7 i5 8gb but it gets incredibly hot and slow.\nI'm not interested in gaming and I will probably use Linux or a dual boot system.\n\nI'm looking for something with a 15-16-17 inch screen a good battery life and not particularly heavy. My budget would be around 1.000€-1.500€.\n\nI liked the size and battery of the lg gram 17 but I don't know if is enough. Then I also looked for something more performing like the legion slim 7i and also the Dell Inspiron 16 plus 7020. But honestly I have no idea if you know something that is good please help me out.",
  "Where are you located in Europe?\n\nThat plays a large part in availability.\n\nAlso, as much as our team likes the overall build and features of the LG Gram series, as our clients can attest they are expensive to repair. And from our side of the fence, they can be a nightmare to work on.",
  "[https://dreammachines.pl/en/notebook/RG3060-15EU50](https://dreammachines.pl/en/notebook/RG3060-15EU50)\n\nI have this laptop and it works great! You can also modify it to your liking i think",
  "Yes I live in Europe. \nFor that reason I didn't even consider the Dell XPS series because here the price for them is crazy!\n\nI did know the LG gram where that bad. Thank you for the insight.",
  "It's actually pretty interesting. Thanks! But I will probably go for something more know since is still a lot of money for me.",
  "It's not that they're bad, on the contrary. LG Gram laptops are actually surprisingly well engineered laptops. But because of their rarity, if they break (and remember they're incredibly lite), they break you. 😁 Or at least your wallet.\n\nThe first one we got in, you've got to understand we had never seen one or knew that they even existed, was due to water damage. It came down to a new motherboard, but the price and lead time was so staggering that the client ended up buying a new laptop. The second one was a busted display, and that wasn't cheap either because LG makes their own displays. But the owners that have them, and have taken care of them, are quite happy with them!\n\nTo help track down a possible laptop, where in Europe are you? Don't want to go searching in Germany, when you're located in France or Belgium.",
  "I'm Italian but I live in Switzerland. I can buy from everywhere in Europe as long as the keyboard is English (QUERTY) and not German (QUERTZ).\n\nRegarding the LG gram I also don't know if is enough for my usage that why I like the idea of having a 17ich light weight machine but I don't know if the i7 and 16gb ram is enough or if it gets to hot. Because in Switzerland I have an endurance that let me repair for a really low sum every laptop. \n\nBut if you have anything in kind that is better for my usage please let me know.\n\nBtw thank you for the help 😄",
  "Laptop buying advice - choice of 3  So I'm looking to upgrade my laptop next month and I'm considering 3 machines: **The LG Gram**, the **Lenovo Legion 7 Slim** and the **Dell XPS 17**. My budget is between $1500 - 1800 and it's basically for internet surfing, light gaming and streaming movies/shows. I don't upgrade often, maybe once every 10 years ...so my main concern is just getting the best all around rig for the money that will be as future proofed as possible. I would prefer 17'' but will take 15'' if it's a much better laptop or deal. I think the Dell XPS is a little out of my price range but there seems to be one on the Dell site under 'Deals' (just not sure if it's 'for real' a decent XPS). Suggestions ...and why you think it's better than the other two? Also I have seen on reviews that UHD will kill the battery life more of the laptop and unless you KNOW you need it (into hardcore gaming) ... you don't really need it? It's a big step up in price I might not need to consider.  Also, is the Intel I7-11800H still a pretty good CPU these days?",
  "BRO. Just get a \"cheap\" $600 laptop. Use that other money for savings, your mortgage, taxes, a PC, crypto, real estate, stock market. Why spend all that money? With the rest ($900-$1200), you could get a PC or use it for the above or other things.",
  "MSI Prestige 15 - Good or bad? I've been looking for the **MSI Prestige 15** for quite a while but I haven't seen a really good in-depth review since it is a bit new. \n\nIt's a 15,6'' inch laptop packed with Intel i7-1185G7 + GTX 1650 Ti Max Q + 1TB SSD + 16GB RAM. \n\nAre there any big complaints about it?\n\nI'm looking for a laptop around 1400-1600 € that is very portable and can take video editing and light gaming well. \n\nAre there any other similar laptops in the market?

  "A whole spring of new laptops are just about to hit the market, new AMD and 30 series equipped laptops will drop at the end of the month, more power for the same price, so will keep up with games for a while to come",
  "I had / have the previous gen of the Prestige 15. i7-10710u variant with the 4k screen. I can't speak to the current one, but I'm sure it'll be a similar or better experience. My main use was as a daily driver and photo editing. \n\nMy main complaints weren't anything drastic.\n\nSpeakers were... disappointing. C+ grade on those imo. Trackpad performance was hit or miss - this could've been specific to my machine, but it always just felt a little bit off. The physical feeling of the trackpad is nice though. Keyboard is shifted ever so slightly to the left which takes some getting used to, but isn't a deal breaker.\n\nBut - portability and build quality are great. Battery life is great. Display is A+ quality. I did pre-order the new G15 as it seems to fit my needs better, but the Prestige is now going to be my partner's daily use machine. Too good to get rid of.",
  "All the other 3 laptops I've put at the end of the post are some of them that will come to the market soon and all of them have the newest CPU / GPUs.\n\nThe thing is I'm not hardcore gaming tho. I want a good all-round laptop with a fair price for the specs it has. If it can game for some hours would be the cherry on top :D",
  "Thanks for your opinion!  \nRegarding video editing and light / moderate gaming, do you have any information? \n\nWhy did you buy the G15? The prestige was not satisfying your laptop needs?  \nI find the G15 an amazing laptop but it lacks one big thing, the webcam (especially in pandemic times) \n\nI'm really indecisive about which laptop to get.",
  "I played a bit of Minecraft (shaders, mods etc.) and Overwatch. Did fine. Fans got loud, was a little hot, but it was the 4k screen option too so that didn't help things.\n\nPhoto and Video editing for the most part was a really nice experience. It handled moderate workloads well. 1080p video editing workloads, or smaller catalogs in Lightroom were really no issue. I did upgrade my camera to the A7rIV - 61mp - 128mb files, and it struggled editing a catalog of those images. It could do it, but it wasn't a smooth experience. \n\nThe G15 intrigued me for the WQHD display (4k is overkill on a laptop imo), the Ryzen processor, and how good last year's G14 was.",
  "[deleted]",
  "Still loving it. I got lucky with my unit - no speaker issues. I don't know my exact battery life, but I haven't had any complaints about it. Love it for photo editing. I'm not gaming on it much, but some casual minecraft is very playable. All in all I have no regrets, though that new M16 coming up may make me eat those words!",
  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",

  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",
  "For me, the biggest issues so far:\n\n1. Occasional phantom touches - similar to the OP\n\n2. eGPU compatibility (GPD G1) - it used to work with meteor lake laptop which I had (YogaBook 9i). Now I am not able to make it work stably with the aura. It will work for a minute or 2, then it will start to get disconnected, sadly.",
  "  \nI have had this laptop for a week. I have updated everything that needed updating (Windows and all relevant drivers). Everything is fine except for the Wi-Fi, which is very slow. I usually connect it to my phone’s hotspot (an S23 Ultra), and when I tested it with Ookla Speedtest, the download speed never exceeded 180 kb/s (0.18 Mb/s), while the upload speed reached up to 4 Mb/s. It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do? I bought this from BestBuy in the U.S., but I’m currently not in the United States. While returning it is not impossible, it would be very difficult, and I would prefer to resolve the issue without having to return it.",
  "It's not uncommon for Lenovo to list the same models next to each other with one being massively discounted!",
  "@[AetherSprite970](https://www.reddit.com/user/AetherSprite970/) Thank you for your excellent and thorough review. \n\nBased on your review, I contacted Lenovo and have confirmation that this laptop uses PWM, but does not use dithering. I will not be buying this laptop!\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 14in (2024) does not use either PWM or dithering.",
  "The PWM or dithering issue scares me from buying this laptop. Does anyone know if it's really an issue? I've read some other reviews of this laptop where this is not mentioned at all. Also does anyone know if the Asus Zenbook s 14 has a PWM or dithering issue? Thanks!",
  "I also am experiencing ghost touches too. Is it worth returning it over.",
  "u/AetherSprite970 Your reviews are excellent and so helpful. Thank you! As a person constantly suffering from eye strain, you've made me aware of the importance of looking beyond just the basic screen specs. In this case, this laptop is an absolute no-go for me based on your experience. I am wondering if iPads suffer from the same problem. I always thought my iPad Pro M1 should give me the most pleasant viewing experience of all my devices, but after just 10 minutes, my eyes hurt like crazy. Is it possible that modern iPads can cause eye strain too?",
  "regarding the Surface Laptop 7, why do you say that arm64 was a too big obstacle? because of some specific application?",
  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues. And if anyone has solved the above issues i'd like to know how to fix it. (I tried bloat removal and even windows reinstall but the issue still persists)",

Has anyone by any chance tried any PCVR games for Twitch streaming on it?    \n  \nI know it obviously isn't meant for that.  I have a gaming PC for this purpose.  But I'd like to do some PCVR on this laptop while away even if it were a marginally painful and degraded experience.  Can it do it even at low settings?",
  "Gave up on windows. Mac won the game. Unless you are absolutely required to run windows in a way that cannot be done with an ARM chip, buy a Mac. Threw up my hands and got a MacBook Pro. Always works. Day three and battery is at 60%. What are we even talking about here",

  "I own the yoga slim 7i aura and it is honestly the worst computer I have ever owned by far. It is super buggy. It crashes and randomly restarts regularly (about every other day). It has graphical glitches (I have seen screen tearing when doing simple things like scrolling a word document). Tons of audio glitches with headphones frequently disconnecting. It is honestly just a terrible computer overall. Worst computer purchase I have ever made by far. I would highly recommend against buying it based on my experience.",
  "I had it for 1 week now and i will return it. The touchpad issue is so bad and i havent seen this conversations before. First the fans are always on, even on energy saver, just chrome some tabs and they are on. Not crazy loud but they are on. I had Premium care and a technician support. the problem with the touchpad is in the bios \" intelligent cooling\", set it to \"perforamce\" and the touchpad wont sleep,  and works. negative is that the fans then are even more loud. at the end i sent it back and bought the sl7 arm, love it so far.",
  "I had the Yoga Slim 7i aura edition for 1 week and gonna return this crap.   \nLove the screen, performance and battery but slightly pressing on the middle of the keyboard deck shuts the laptop down as if it shorts itself. \n\n\\- Fan sounds like a 1.9tdi   \n\\- Screen flickers when volume up/down  \n\\- shorts itself when slightly pressing on middle of keyboard  \n\n\nVery good laptop for only $1200 CAD but too many flaws.",
  "What is the battery life like?",
  "It could match a MacBook Pro though, and still be a horrible laptop. For example, unless it's one of the newest MacBook pros, you might be used to an incredibly glossy screen that leads to a busted user experience if there are windows or uncontrolled lights nearby.\n\nMy M1 Max MacBook Pro was also incredibly laggy for things like window snapping and some other things where I couldn't get rid of the animation and you just have to wait for part of a second from time to time before you can do things.\n\nPretty amazing that it compares to a multi-thousand dollar laptop, but also multi-thousand dollar laptops these days can be pretty disgusting, or at least that has been my experience with the M1 Max, and some Windows laptops from Dell, Asus, and Framework being laggy with windows 11.\n\nMaybe it's just a software problem though and I shouldn't be comparing wildly inefficient operating systems like Mac OS and Windows 11 to things like debloated Windows 10 or Linux on a 12-year-old Thinkpad originally rated for 24 hours of battery life.",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "How do the speakers compare to the MBP?  Thx",
  "I currently have the G16 and the aura and when it comes to speaker quality, these two are pretty close. the G16 has a slightly fuller bass and slightly wider sound stage. In my opinion if the G16 are a 10, the Aura speakers are a 9.5. I also feel the browsing experience to be much better on the Aura. I experience more lag on the G16 and the fans kick on, the SOC can get too hot for the G16 to sit on the lap, even with light browsing. That being said the track pad on the G16 is better. while the keyboard on the Aura is much better",
  "I was thinking of buying this but it has way too much bass, since I listen to music a lot that's a dealbreaker for me. Also, the bass resonates across the laptop body which creates a weird sensation if you're typing while listening to music. I tried adjusting equalizer in dolby software but still couldn't get the sound right. Did you find a solution to eliminate bass (so chassis doesn't resonate) and music becomes clear?",

  "I also posted a review of SL7 a few months ago if you wanted to have a look. The SL7's display is pretty comparable to the Aura's. It had worse PPI (201 vs 222), and worse subjective calibration making it bit washed out, but didn't have the IPS glow issues of the Aura. The AR coating was also better. I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve. The chassis would get way too warm in heavier tasks and the fan would hardly do anything. But still, I prefer the SL7's acoustics. No noise in a docked setup.",

  "Is it a problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "The low RPM noise isn’t too bad, it’s just the fact it’s there at all that irks me. It’s completely unnecessary to have such an aggressive fan curve with a Lunar lake chip inside, but I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker. \n\nThe eye strain comes from the GPU, not the glossy display surface. Same strain when docked. Seems to be recent intel GPU’s from what I’ve read, causing issues for those sensitive to dither, or whatever rendering technique it is that causes the pain.",
  "The Aura screen dimensions are compatible with the MacBook Air 15. Get a MBA 15 compatible matte screen protector, and it'll greatly reduce glare and reflections on the Aura.",

  "After using for some time, I think it’s similar to surface laptop screen. It’s reflective but with decent resolution. Colors are vibrant. I mostly work inside so it’s been fine. Working outside might be slightly tough because the screen is pretty reflective (not as good coating as MacBook). If you turn up the brightness to 100% that might make it better for outside work.",
  "I think the same, if not even better.   So loud and clear and good bass too.   I've tested both the 14\" and the 15.3 and had zero issues.  I think the one this person is talking about was just a lemon",

No more MS laptops for me thanks.",

  "Ya, it’s been hit or miss on battery life. Touchpad gets finicky w longer use, appears to be pretty sensitive to the oils on the skin and any grime so I try to use the mouse. I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",

  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

  "hi I am someone using this laptop for a month. Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo. I have a desktop that goes 165hz and that's more for gaming. sure it's smooth and all but eh not worth the batt life tradeoff).\n\nif you realllly wanna stretch the life, use MS edge as ur browser cuz that's the least battery draining browser out there.

Unfortunately, she decided return the laptop after just one week as the case kept splitting open at the front under the touchpad. This indicates some poor built quality. I tried it out myself for a bit and also found the feeling and aesthetics rather on the cheap and plasticky side. The system also felt very sluggish and performed poorly in everyday web browsing and office tasks.\n\nAfter the MSI Prestige, I recommended my friend to get a full aluminium Lenovo Yoga 7i 14\" instead.

  "Impression + AMA - Core Ultra 7 258v VS Ryzen 7 AI 350 for a casual user (feat. Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Gen 10) Hello there! Just a quick introduction to explain why I'm making this post: I'm currently in the market for a new laptop (coming from a Blade 14 2021 w/ RTX 3070). Here are my requirements:\n\n* Thin and light\n* Decent battery life (doesn't need to exceed 10 hours)\n* Most importantly, good unplugged performance\n* Casual gaming (mostly indies)\n* Quiet and at least not hot to the touch\n\nMy Typical Usage:\n\n**Two Browsers** – about 20–30 tabs each\n\n* **Browser 1** – TradingView, multiple crypto trading exchanges\n* **Browser 2** – Messenger, WhatsApp, X, Telegram, Discord, Databricks, Reddit, YouTube, Chatgpt etc.\n\n**Other apps (background + foreground)** – Spotify, Outlook, Teams, ShareX, OneDrive, Steam, Excel spreadsheets (2–3 at least)\n\nSo, I narrowed my choice down to the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7, but I have a big dilemma due to the CPU choice—Intel 258v vs. AMD AI 350. Naturally, being an AMD fanboy, I would have picked the AI 350 without question, especially since AMD has usually been the battery champ in Windows laptops over the past few years. After doing further research into Lunar Lake, I'm very intrigued by its efficiency but wary about the lack of multithreading.\n\nThe problem is that there isn't a review out there that really focuses on actual unplugged user experience in terms of performance and multitasking. Most reviewers dish out raw numbers like everyone is a content creator or something. Sure, user experience is rather hard to quantify, but I need a laptop that feels smooth in daily use.\n\nTherefore, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I went to my local retailer and ordered both models. They just arrived today, so now I have the AMD model with a touchscreen in Tidal Teal and the Intel model without a touchscreen in Lunar Grey. After setting them up and playing around for a few hours, here are my early impressions (mind you, these are not scientific results).\n\n**Performance (Unplugged) – Nitpick Alert**\n\nNo, I don't run benchmark scores—you can find those online easily. I care more about actual system responsiveness: how the laptop feels in day-to-day use and under light loads.\n\n**Intel 258v** – To my surprise, the 258v delivers much better responsiveness. I'm talking about switching windows, animations, moving things around the screen, having multiple windows open, and running background apps during my typical workload. Additionally, it’s able to handle everything I need without a single lag—I even had a 4K YouTube video playing in a floating window while working. Even in 'Best Power Efficiency' mode, the scrolling animations remain smooth, which is a nice touch. Sure, my workload isn’t the heaviest, but this is an ace in my book. One thing to note: I started noticing slight sluggishness in animations when the battery falls below 15%.\n\n**AMD AI 350** – While the AI 350 can also do everything without slowing down, the general animations aren't as smooth as the 258v’s when unplugged. Things like minimizing/maximizing windows and bringing up the quick menu feel less fluid. This is particularly noticeable in 'Best Power Efficiency' mode, where I lose the smooth scrolling animation while charting on TradingView. It’s not bad or slow per se—it works fine—it’s just that the 258v keeps things consistently smooth across all settings.\n\nI'll run some games during the weekend and see how it goes. However, gaming performance is not my main requirement—nice to have, but not a must-have. You can find plenty of benchmarks online anyway.\n\n**Noise & Heat**\n\nAnother win here for the 258v. Aside from the initial setup, the fan rarely ramps up. While running my typical workload, it gets just a little warm at the top left corner of the keyboard—not bothersome at all. Otherwise, it remains cool and quiet. \n\nThe AMD AI 350 also fares pretty well—it gets *slightly* warmer than the 258v, but I'd say it's negligible. The fan kicks in more often than the Intel 258v’s, though. However, I'd say both can achieve silent performance.\n\n**Battery Life**\n\nToo early to tell, as I haven't gone through a full battery cycle on either laptop yet. First impressions suggest both are neck and neck. I'll update the post once I have more results.\n\n**Build Quality**\n\nNormally, they should be the same, but I noticed a few differences worth reporting. The AI 350 has some backplate creaks—it makes a slight noise when picking the laptop up or moving the lid. Meanwhile, the 258v feels more solid, but it has a rattly touchpad, which kind of drives me nuts at times. Lenovo's QC seems poor here.\n\nI find this surprising since I usually hear Lenovo has the fewest RMA cases—or maybe I just have the worst luck.\n\nAs of now, the Intel 258v is more likely to stay with me. I'll update this post once I have more testing results. **AMA!**",
  "Well, the Intel Is Better in every category except multi core performance, battery Life Will be mutch Better(around 15% more), if you want tò go amd with some reason tò not go with Intel you should get a ryzen 9 365, or if you do not care using Intel the ultra 7 258v or if you want also multicolore performance (loosing the bonus battery Life ) the 255h",
  "I'm having the same experience as you with a new AMD AI 350 Laptop (HP OmniBook X) that for some reason doesn't feel as smooth for casual use which is surprising coming from a Ryzen 5 5600H as reference.  I'm not sure if it's the HP bloatware and I should try a fresh windows install before returning. \n\n\nI'm getting in the meantime a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i with the Core Ultra 7 258v so I will be able to compare between those.",
  "I'm thinking about whether it's worth paying $200 more for the 258V?",
  "I'm planning to upgrade from my Lenovo with a 5500U because it's starting to feel a bit slow in everyday use nothing heavy, mostly just browsing. I was leaning towards AMD for the performance, but your comparison really got me thinking, and now I'm considering the 258v. Did you end up keeping it? How’s it been after using it for a while?",
  "Hey mate, what did you notice with the battery life?",
  "Any updates on the battery life?^^",
  "How did it go?",
  "I guess this really depends if you need that 32GB. As far as I know, there isnt too much CPU performance different wbeen 256v vs 258v but yeah the price different is rather steep.  \nPersonally, I only upgrade my laptop like after 5 years or when it dies, so 32GB could futureproof'' things down the road for me.",
  "Ended up getting a HP Omnibook Ultra with the Intel 258V. So far way smoother experience than the Omnibook X with the AI 350 for some reason even though the specs of the AMD sounded better. The Yoga Slim 7i was equally smooth experience when I tried but found a great deal on the HP.",
  "Sorry, I meant that I'm also looking at the Lenovo Yoga 7i and the Intel version with the 258V is $200 more than the Ryzen 7 AI 350.",
  "And how is the battery in comparison?",
  "sorry i misunderstood your question.  \npersonally I would, considering Im only mostly doing light but moderate multitasking, I dont need that extra horsepower considering the 258v has plenty for me.\n\nMoreover, the extra battery life, silence and lower temp gives a nice feeling.\n\nBut anyway, I've returned both of the laptop due to build quality issue.\n\nI've just picked a 2024 Omnibook Ultra Flip 14 on sales, 10% less than what I paid for the yoga 7 258v, which has way better build quality. However, the Yoga has better screen quality though as the screendoor effect on the HP is crazy.",
  "Hye, any update on the battery life comparison? Did you test it out completely before returning them?",
  "yes please any battery life updates? what are your thoughts",
  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "nooo dont get norton, windows defender is perfectly fine\n\nand no sadly the ram isnt upgradeable. with the new core ultra chips, the ram is soldered (memory on package is another way of saying it), so that the ram has higher speeds=better performance especially for the igpu\n\nand clicking on the build your pc option, it seems like we cant even get 32gb which sucks\n\nthe only option with 32gb ram is the core ultra 7 258v, which seems like it is an extra 110 in total. if youre willing to spend that much, its gonna be worth it (better cpu and gpu performance+more ram).",

  "Unhappy with Legion 7, any other recommendations? I recently got myself a Lenovo Legion 7 pro, and it just doesn’t work for me. I’m going into university next month, and I wanted something that could handle demanding games while also being good for my education. The legion seemed nice to me, high quality and it was very high performing. I got the RTX 5080 with the intel 275HX.\n\nThe problems are that it’s ridiculously heavy, it’s shaped like a square, and the battery life is abysmal. That wouldn’t be the biggest issue if the charger didn’t as much as a literal brick, but it does. Together, the laptop and charger weigh almost 10 pounds…\n\nAre there any other laptops out there that can perform somewhat close to the legion that will last all day and not give me back pain? \n\nThanks for the help!",

I'd probably recommend the [ROG Zephyrus G14](https://smbtech.au/features/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-laptop-review-2024-ga403/) as you can find recent ones relatively cheap in sales. Razer might also suit you.",
  "You need a Zephyrus or Blade 16 2025.\n\nZephyrus is probably the least likely to have issues, but is power limited. 5070 Ti is is considered the best option given its power limits.\n\nBlade 16 2025 has had some quality control issues (typical Razer), but can run at higher power levels (technically Zeph can too via some hacking). Still limited to around 140W though. This pick makes more sense for a 5080, but give yourself a month spare in case you need to RMA.\n\nAlso --- you can power the laptop with a USB-C charger for school use.",
