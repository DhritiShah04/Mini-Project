  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Legion 5 Gen 10 vs 5i vs Alienware 16 Aurora vs 16 X Hello everyone,\n\nI'm going to study abroad soon and I need a laptop that can do it all. I made a pre-selection which seemed interesting in terms of quality and price but I will need advice to be able to decide because it is the first PC at this price and with gaming characteristics that I am going to buy. \n\nSo here are the characteristics of the 4 computers that I selected: \n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 (15' AMD)\n-AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 (or the 260?)\n-ram 32go ddr5 600MT/s (2x16go)\n-1TB ssd m.2 2242PCIe Gen 4 TLC\n-15.1’ (2560x1600) OLED screen, 500nits, 165Hz\n-nvidia 5060 8gb \n-80Wh battery\n\nPrice: between 1480 and 1520 (varies depending on the processor)\n\n-Legion 5i Gen 10 (15’ Intel)\n-Intel Core I7 14700HX 14th Gen \nSame specifications as the one above\n\nPrice: 1490\n\n-Alienware 16: \n-I7 240H series 2\n-Nvidia 5060 8gb\n-32gb of ddr5 memory (2x16gb)\n-ssd 1to\n-touchpad\n-16’ screen 2560x1600, 120hz, 300cd\n-60Wh battery\n\nPrice: 1199 instead of 1499\n\n-Alienware 16X\n-Intel Ultra 7 255HX\n-16GB of memory 2x8GB\n-240Hz screen\n-96Wh battery \n-the rest similar to the one above \n\nPrice: 1449 instead of 1699\n\n\nMy priority is that the computer can: \n\nHold a day of classes without playing video games.\nA screen with perfect quality.\nBeing able to support any video game.\nBe as quiet as possible (except when playing video games where I expect noise).\n\nFrom what I have read, the problem with the Legion equipped with the i7 is that it consumes a lot of energy even when you are not playing video games because it is not optimized to be on a laptop (I saw between 3 and 5 hours of autonomy). Conversely, the AMD Ryzen 7 allows you to last 10 hours for office activities but is 30% less efficient on demanding video games. \nAt this point should I invest in an RTX 5070 with the AMD Ryzen 7? \n\nFor the Alienware I saw a lot of criticism that it wasn't a real Alienware but a rebadged Dell, then I didn't see any test on the durability of the battery and for video games I also saw several reviews about it.\n\nWhat do you think? \n\nAnd if you have other computers I can advise you!",
  "Upgrade, or try to fix and/or live with it? [Legion Pro 5 16ARX8] Hey there! I bought a Legion Pro 5 16ARX8 (82WM0006US) just over two years ago. It's been great, but recently it's starting to accumulate some wear/issues and I'm wondering if 1) it's new enough that I should get it fixed and live with whatever can't be repaired, or 2) upgrade to something new?\n\nCurrent issues: \n\n- The screen got damaged when I had the laptop in a checked bag while traveling, wherein there's a faint thin line midway up the screen, which is functional for some colors but shows as a faint blue line for others. I've gotten estimates for repairs, which are always in the $400-500 range. But currently it's fine enough that I can live with it, it'd just be a nice plus to have it fixed.\n- It's been overheating badly lately, and some components haven't been working well. I cleaned out the fans to some improvement, but since the overheating issues, my keyboard sometimes stops working intermittently (usually fixed with a restart).\n- The trackpad mouse has been acting up, but it's probably because I badly reconnected the ZIF connector when cleaning out the internals, and could probably fix this.\n\n\nCurrent specs:\n\n- AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX\n- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070\n- 32GB DDR5\n- 1TB SSD\n- 2 TB SSD\n\nI've been thinking of upgrading to a newer Legion 5 Pro (maybe the new [Gen 10](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-pro-series/legion-pro-5-gen-10-16-inch-amd/83ltcto1wwus1)?) or an Asus ROG Zephyrus, either the [G16](https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/asus/rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gu605) or maybe something more compact for traveling like the [G14](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-3k-oled-120hz-gaming-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-1tb-platinum-white/6613954.p?skuId=6613954&sb_share_source=PDP). Open to other ideas! But the hitch is whether it's worth the $2-3k after just 2 years with the current one...\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading, grateful for any input!",
  "How are the thermals on the Lenovo Legion 5 with Ryzen 4800H and RTX 2060? I've read some of the terrible reviews on the Asus TUF 15\" series here, I was wondering if the Lenovo Legion 5 is any better?\n\nDoes it thermal throttle out of the box? Do you need to undervolt the CPU to get the GPU to perform better like I read about some user having to do with the Asus?",
  "The thermals are already good enough out of the box. But for the best temps, you want to swap the stock thermal paste with a quality, high performance one (like Kryonaut). \n\nYou can't undervolt Ryzen, sadly. Though there should be no need to that, these 7nm chips are already as efficient as they can get.",
  "So you think it's definitely the better choice than the Asus TUF then?",
  "Yes, definitely. Don't get the TUF A15, bad cooling.",
  "How does the Omen 15 stack up against this one in terms of cooling/thermals?",
  "Should be the same as the Legion. Both are great picks for a mid-range gaming laptop.",
  "Which one is better? My father wants to buy a Laptop for Architectural/Rendering/Civil Construction Purposes.\n\nI don’t have that good of a knowledge in Technical specification of laptops. All I know is that the RTX 5000 series are the latest series of graphic card. But now I’m confused as my father checked on CHAT GPT about which GPU is better, according to CHAT GPT, the 4070 would be a better choice cause of some technical stuff that I can’t understand.\n\nI thought taking a review from the community would be a good idea.\n\nAlso the price difference between the two laptops is around ₹25000 (~$285)",
  "4070 Legion\n\nPredator is good too but 5050 isn't worth it",
  "Ok, thank you for the suggestion. Also, is there any particular reason why the 4070 is better than the 5050?",
  "it’s just better it’s like idk 2070 and 3050",
  "- Better performance \n- Better frame rate\n- Better TFLOPS\n- 64 more tensor cores for AI\n- Better shading units",
  "Okey, Thanks for the help.",
  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget €2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years. As longevity is important, I believe performance is an important criteria. My current setup is an 8th gen Intel i5 Asus laptop (8/256) and a M4 Mac Mini (24/512) on the desk. I want to replace both of these items with a single Windows laptop and I'll sell the Mac. I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around €2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. €1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. €1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. €1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. €2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. €2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** €2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",
  "Have you ruled out Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024 or 2025)? It is a cheaper Asus ProArt with the same of internals.  These Asus model carry the best speakers of all Windows laptops which is nice to have if you have kids or others to share a screen.",
  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",
  "Question: why are you listing high refresh rate laptops? Is that something you want?\n\nBecause I doubt you’ll max out that refresh rate in games unless you play older games or competitive online games.\n\nEdit: nvm just saw you don’t care about games.",
  "Have you considered a HP ZBook?",
  "T14 Thinkpads",
  "Update: Added the Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) to the list",
  "I did but seems a little difficult to find them not overly priced in Ireland.",
  "I'm doing some research on the P14s this morning.\n\nDirect from Lenovo I can get the Ultra 9 185H, no operating system, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 3K IPS display for €2370.\n\nA local retailer has the Ultra 9 185H, Win 11 Pro, 32GB RAM, 1TB performance SSD, 2560x1600 @ 90Hz display for €1790.\n\nI don't think the better display is worth €600.",
  "Also, unlike the ProArt you don't need to pay for a 4070 you said you wouldn't be using much. The 16:10 screen is also good for web development with it's bit of extra height. P1's are also pretty much the top of the Thinkpad scale, being workstation laptops and thus very solid. P1 gen 7 is also 17mm thick and 2kg so pretty portable.",
  "You're right, I never game but do appreciate a nice smooth screen. High refresh rate is not a must have but more a nice to have.",
  "I will take a look, thanks",
  "Thanks. A lot of praise online for Thinkpads",

  "ThinkBook 16 vs Swift Go for multipurpose everyday laptop? Hi, first post here after reading TONS about laptop brands, multiple reviews, lots of 'best laptop for school' posts, youtube reviews etc etc. Yes, I am a student. I wanted a good laptop that will last a good 3 to 5 years. Im mainly doing lots of word, excel, powerpoint, and have lots of tabs open at once, watching videos. Im also interested in some amateur photoshop stuff. I also will be watching a good amount of movies, and I'd like play some video games. I think if the laptop would support it, I would play newer more demanding games, like Cyberpunk and Alan Wake 2, but gaming is not the focus. If I could at least play games like Witcher 3 and maybe baldurs gate 3, and some emulators for PS2, PS3 and PS4 games I would be happy. \n\nOriginally I bought a Legion pro 7i with the 4080 and intel i9, because I wanted a laptop that could handle most anything and be relevant for years. It seems like a great machine, but i think I made a mistake spending that much money, I'm not a hardcore gamer.. I feel I am wasting money.. so I'm looking at returning it and buying one of these 2 laptops. Please tell me your thoughts and which you would go with considering my needs?

  "Subject: Seeking Laptop Advice for Drawing with Clip Studio and 3D Software Hey everyone,\n\nI'm currently in the market for a laptop primarily focused on drawing, with a keen interest in using software like Clip Studio Paint and various 3D modeling tools. Initially, I planned to invest in a PC setup, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I've had to rethink my decision and opt for a laptop instead.\n\nI've been researching extensively and have come across the Legion 5 Pro as a potential option. However, I've noticed recurring concerns about the screen turning off and not charging, which has made me a bit hesitant. On the other hand, the Omen series has received favorable reviews, although noise levels from the fans seem to be a common point of criticism.\n\nOne thing I dislike about laptops, in general, is the noise from fans, so I'm particularly sensitive to that aspect.\n\nI'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations regarding laptops suitable for digital art and 3D work.

  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",

My budget is around 1300 dollars and I have found two good options: [Dell Vostro 7510 15 Inch Laptop | Dell USA](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w11p1c4005) and [Legion 5i 15” Gaming Laptop with RTX | Lenovo US](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-5-series/legion-5i-gen-6-(15''-intel)/len101g0001?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F)\n\nThe Lenovo legion 5i gen 6 has the same specifications as the Vostro 7510, except that it has 3060 instead of 3050ti. On the other hand, the vostro 7510 has a 86W battery which is greater than the legion's 60W battery. As per this, I am leaning towards the vostro because it has a better battery and it is lighter than the legion 5i.\n\nThe only thing holding me back from ordering is some reviews I read online about the laptop. Some people report that under load, the vostro is loud and hot. Is this the case with this laptop? Are there any other cons with the Vostro 7510? Finally, do you know of any other good laptops with similar specs in this price range?",
  "not sure if you bought it already but you can decrease fans and temps by going into your bios and performance tab and disabling intel turbo boost or repaste your cpu and gpu",
  "Honest recommendation for 1000-1500 Eur gaming laptop (2020/21), only from 6 months + owners , EUROPE I have asus-g55vw for freaking 6 years. It costed about 1200 eur, 12gb ram I7, its 17 inches, 2 massive vents (honestly it looks like car from behind), even now playing games on it use it in work, for this 6 years I bring it with me to work every freaking day, it falled on floor several times, can't see key letters for last 2 years, so many times I put it in bag in summer when it did not go to sleep regime since (OBS bug) I thought its end of it but those vent's are monsters. Still here still playing Path of exile and streaming at the same time with like no overheat. I never had to open this notebook its still same as I bought it. Still can hit the screen with hand, and it wont even budge, those hinges are just marvelous. Sadly they do not sell this type of construction anymore?\n\nSo its 2020 now and I wonder its time to upgrade. I go google for a endless week of reviews (mostly paid reviews) . And ended up with kind of depression, what a bad laptops. Like half of all 2020 models have endless screenshots of Hinges broken in even 1-2 months (Msi leopard, Hp pavilion), or extreme bad thermals in all new asus (stix, tuf). Then a lot of recommendations which are likely impossible to get/buy in Europe with any varranty. With my good g55vw past I adviced friend to buy asus as new notebook , and he spend 2 years with his laptop nonstop in warranty service with display issues. Or laptops where reviewer advices first thing to do open it and throw vent blocking stuff out from it and change paste on cpu right after buy - bloody hell.\n\nIs there really not single durable gaming notebook, that is widely accepted by gamers in this price range ? Please if You have one for longer than 6 months (not some 1 week testing blah), please share with me, am loosing all hope for humanity in this :) Internet is not what it used to be, source of relevant information.\n\nAs time go I will maybe add all concrete models and why they sux, all those \"best\" lists are making me sick, its time for \"worst\" list, like last thing one wants is notebook where on its official board there is Topic - \"broken hinges is common issue\" .\n\nA long quest looking for, **good cooling + good hinges** notebook, since if display falls off you wont play on it much and when it hits overheat its performance go down so dramatically that gpu or cpu do not matter much anymore.

And it offers 1,5 TB of space which has no equal in its price tag, also with graphic card being at 60 place which is great for its price range. And is also easy openable which is also not so common. And as pure bonus (which is least what matters to me) it looks very stylish. What a bargain.\n\nAnd mainly, I didn't found and reddit about \"Oh it broken in 1st week\", which is very common about all 2020 models.",

  "The IPS screen on the 7567 is a game changer in the US - really sucks that you can't buy it in Canada. I'd recommend the other laptops. Maybe consider the Acer Helios 300 (GTX 1060 at just over $1000 USD) if it's the same price in Canada.  ",

  "Yeah... It's Amazon, and I believe it's the only place that sells Helios. Btw for Lenovo Y520, for casual gaming like OW, WOT or sth like that, would a i5-7300HQ works better than i7-7700HQ? If we take battery life into account, is i7 ($135 difference) that important?",

  "Depends what you want to do. Across the board the new i7 is an improvement in gaming. How much? Less than you'd think. Some games really make use of extra cores, but they are few and far between.\n\nIf the laptop is for work, boy will you see an improvement. \n\nExtra screen real estate is nice if you need it. I do programming and fifteen inches is tough. Not impossible though, as I'm buying the Msi gs65 when it comes to Canada in May. I value quiet and light over screen real estate.

  "Ideapad pro 5 vs legion 5 Hi, I am thinking about buying a new laptop for collage and I can't decide which to get.

  "The Legion Slim 5, hands down. I actually bought a refurbished one from this eBay seller: https://ebay.us/Jpwgit and it’s been good, no issues so far. The performance is amazing for the price, especially for CAD and light gaming. It doesn’t look too gamer-y either, just a bit thicker than ultrabooks but still clean-looking. #ad",

  "Review of Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 (15in, 16gb, 512gb SSD, AMD Ryzen 5700u) I bought the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 (15in, 16gb, 512gb SSD, AMD Ryzen 5700u) in India. Here is my review about it after using it for about 2 weeks.\n\n**Build:**\n\n* Update after 14 months (16 Oct 2022): Shit quality hinge. Broke twice till now without ever dropping the laptop.\n* Full plastic build. Metal Lid. Matte finish. Feels great and solid.\n* Keyboard and touchpad are great\n\n**General things:**\n\n1. Initially I had some problem with the speakers when they would stop working and I had to restart the laptop to fix. I got a driver update a couple days later, haven't had that same problem since.\n2. The fingerprint can be a hit or miss sometimes due to its design, I then added my fingerprint from multiple angles so mostly works but sometimes have to try again.\n3. My unit had some backlight bleed on the bottom right corner noticeable when in a dimly lit room at above 70% brightness. Not a problem for me since I dim the screen to around 30% in the dark. This will vary by laptop though.\n4. I have a problem with OBS recordings. It seems that OBS is recording at same volume as windows master volume. I haven't been able to find a fix for it. Every program I tried which captures audio from speakers to record/broadcast (OBS, XSlit, Anydesk) have the same issue.  **(EDIT: FIX: Roll Back Realtek (R) Audio drivers so that the manufacturer is Microsoft, Dolby audio will stop working though if you do it. Not recommended.)**\n5. The product description states that it has Bluetooth 5.0 but the device manager says its Bluetooth 5.1.\n\n**Expandability**:\n\nI opened mine up coz of curiosity. The internal design is the same as last years version.\n\n1. The RAM is soldered in dual channel. (Task Manager)\n2. There is one M.2 NVME SSD slot which is already populated with the 512 GB SSD.\n3. There is a space for an HDD but it doesn't come with the SATA cable installed, the SATA cable will need to be purchased separately to install a hard drive within the laptop.\n4. The laptop comes with WI-FI 5 and not WI-FI 6 unlike last years version. The WI-FI card is upgradable if you need WIFI 6.\n5. The internal battery can also be upgraded to 70 Whrs version. However note that if you do upgrade, it will occupy the HDD slot aswell.\n\nLink to Lenovo's Spare parts website of this model. [IdeaPad 5 ALC05 Type 92LN Spare parts](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/in/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/5-series/ideapad-5-15alc05/82ln/parts/display/compatible)\n\n**Battery life estimates from 100 percent battery (70% brightness):**\n\n1. Watching movies (Chrome with 5 extensions - 1 tab open, discord, telegram, anydesk, Battery saving mode active from Vantage software, Better battery saving mode in windows.) - 9hrs\n2. Moderate Multi tasking (Listening to music, actually using chrome, discord, qbittorrent (downloading) and a bunch of other background programs, Battery saving mode from Vantage software, Better battery saving mode in windows.) - 6 to 7 hrs\n\n* Note: I use my laptop on conservation mode all the time so it charges only to 60%. The battery life is based on the time it take to drain the laptop from 60% to around 30% and multiplying that by 3.\n* The conservation mode is not customizable. Its either 60% charge or 100% charge.\n* Also, I absolutely love the conservation mode, ~~no other brands have this~~ Asus and Dell also have it according to the internet. My laptop remains on the desk most of the time so I don't have to worry about it remaining on 100% all the time.\n\n**Fans (In an air conditioned room)**\n\n* On Battery- The laptop fans are completely off when watching movies. They may or may not turn on when multi tasking.\n* Plugged in- The fans only turned off when set to Battery Saving Mode in Vantage and doing light tasks.\n* Fans are inaudible (if they do turn on) when doing basic tasks in a room with air conditioner running, only slightly audible with the air conditioner off.\n\n**iGPU**:\n\n* Out of the 16gb ram, 2GB is dedicated for the iGPU, this can be changed in BIOS to 1GB or 512 MB.\n\n**Lenovo Power Management modes:**\n\n* Extreme Performance- TDP is 35 Watts.\n* Intelligent Cooling- TDP is 25 Watts.\n* Battery Saving Mode- TDP is 15 Watts.\n* On Battery, change to best performance (windows) and these modes function the same as plugged in.  I did notice that Battery Saver Mode (Vantage) turns on the fans later than the Intelligent cooling mode which is I guess nice if you're trying to save battery.\n\n**Performance Benchmarks (Plugged in)(Extreme Performance):**\n\n* **Cinnebench R23**\n   * Multi Core **-** 9655 points, 3.65 GHz across all cores, Max: 85 C, Power: 35 W\n   * Single Core **-** 1245 points, 4.3 Ghz single core, Max: 70 C, Power: 10 W\n* **Crystal DiskMark-** 2481 MB/s Read, 1726 MB/s Write\n\n**Performance Benchmarks on battery:**\n\nThe laptop can achieve full performance on battery as well, change from Better Battery mode to Best performance mode in the Windows battery settings.\n\n**Note:** On battery, Better Battery (and Battery Saver) mode locks the CPU at base clock of 1.8 Ghz to get maximum battery life. While using this mode, I did not suffer any hanging when doing casual tasks, (Web browsing, YouTube, Discord etc.)\n\nIf you wanna know something else about it. Please let me know. I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.\n\n* EDIT #1: Added Benchmarks.\n* EDIT #2: Photo of the internals. [https://imgur.com/a/5WCUKW4](https://imgur.com/a/5WCUKW4)\n   * Disassembly video from YouTube (not the exactly same model): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKF\\_9L1qfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKF_9L1qfY)\n* EDIT #3, #4: Added battery benchmarks, then deleted them because I tested them on Better battery mode which locks the clock speed to 1.8Ghz.\n* Edit #5: Cleaned up the post.\n   * Update as of 8 Sept 2021: I have been having some weird touchpad problem. [Details here](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-IdeaPad-1xx-3xx-5xx-7xx-Edge-LaVie-Z-Flex-Notebooks/Touchpad-sluggish-Latency-Lag/m-p/5095310). This has not been fixed after a touchpad replacement so currently working on it. The issue does seem isolated to just me though.\n* Edit #6: Update as of 16 Oct 2022: The hinge is shit quality, it has broken twice till now in the exact same manner with completely normal use.",
  "I can confirm that the hinge quality is garbage. I use mine almost entirely at home, after 2 years of use I have used it no more than 30 times outside. I very rarely open and close the lid when I use it at home because I can sense right from the beginning the hinge quality is not the best although I did not expect it to be this bad. And yet the hinge broke! Together with the LCD!\n\nI paid RM170 (around 39 USD) just to get the one time on site repair because they said repair at the depot would take around 2 weeks time and I had no spare laptop. The basic, send in to the depot warranty covered the spare parts, luckily. So if you guys are planning to buy this model, **do consider to upgrade to the onsite warranty to 3 or 4 years** (depending on how long you plan to use the device). \n\nThe technician who came even told me this model and the model 3 are plagued with this problem. 7 and thinkpads fair better. I wish I'd known.\n\nPerformance wise, it is amazing. Still running strong after two years. (I open many tabs on Edge daily, at times 30-50 tabs, rarely any hiccup.) i5 11 gen, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Heat management is superb as well. It heats up but never overheat, not once.\n\nCheers,  \nR.",
  "Thank you for the review! This is by far the most comprehensive one I've read about this laptop as it's just been released.\n\nI have a few questions-\n1. Do you notice a significant drop in performance (general multi tasking) when on battery vs plugged in?\n2. Does the 100% screen brightness hold up in well-lit rooms or under the sun?\n3. How was the initial set-up process like? Did you install any specific programs/drivers that helped?",
  "Thankx for the review, based on it I will no more 'struggle' with choosing a new laptop from Lenovo, I got a bit scared haha. I'm gonna carry on with my HP's. They have not failed me yet, and I have been happy with performances so far. :)",
  "**Beware: Major Touchpad Problem**\n\nI bought a Lenovo Ideapad Silm 5 laptop in Aug 23, and I thought all is well until a few months in. My touchpad stopped functioning but thankfully, the onsite warranty allowed me to change my motherboard. A few months down the road, the same issue arose, and I was told by the customer hotline to undergo numerous upgrading of software, restarting of laptop, etc, and the touchpad would mysteriously function after a months/weeks until it breaks down again. This laptop is reaching its 1 year mark, and the same issue still persists. It has been a major inconvenience, especially since a mouse cannot entirely replace the functions of the touchpad (i.e. pinching in/out to enlarge the text). To my dismay, I was told by the onsite warranty engineer that the touchpad issue is rampant in laptops of this particular model. I asked for an upgrade of my laptop or replacement of another model, but I was told that this was not Lenovo's usual practice. Am still monitoring the issue after the engineer has replaced the touchpad (for second time), but if anything, **please do not purchase this model** unless you are willing to forgo its touchpad.\n\nTrust me, their onsite warranty they provide is not worth in exchange for your sanity if you were to constantly experience the same issue. The warranty team somehow does not understand what \"intermittent issue\" mean, and they'll put you through the arduous process of troubleshooting and restarting, only for you to find yourself back to square one.\n\nP.S. My USB ports were also not working, but it's fixed atm.",

Cause right now, it is 68k INR. And is it worth the price?\n\n\nHow is the cooling on this laptop? Does it heat up under medium-heavy loads? Especially without air conditioning.\n\n\nDoes it stutter or lag a bit when you launch an app or open a web browser or type? Especially when on battery?\n\n\n\nI tried the Intel model for the Ideapad which apparently uses the same body and parts as the Ryzen 5700U model. I did not find the keyboard and the touchpad as good as I was expecting (but I could be wrong cause I only tried it for a few seconds). \n\n\nIs the battery replaceable/ easily removeable by the user? Or does one have to take it to a service center?\n\nI was also considering the HP laptops with Ryzen 5500U but the 15in (my preferred screen size) has a TN panel while the 14in does have IPS but is glossy (I need antiglare so it doesn't strain my eyes).\n\n\nThe Ideapad 5 and Legion 5 just seem so much better.",

Would I see a major difference in battery drain and temperature, if I turn on Extreme Performance in BIOS but Balanced mode on Windows?\n\nAlso, does it make any sense to do this for gaming purposes? Because if you're going to play while the system is AC wired the TDP would be higher than 25W anyways, am I right?",

  "Hi,\n\n1. The performance drop is not noticeable doing casual tasks on battery vs plugged in. Tried loading web pages and video playback. 4k60fps video playback is smooth on both. \n2. 100% screen brightness definitely holds up in a well lit room, I cam easily manage at 70% brightness in my room. This is probably the best you'll get in this price range, most competition only offer 250 nit screens while this is a 300 nit screen.\n3. Set-up process is pretty classic for windows. The only bloatware was McAfee which I promptly uninstalled. I found once that Lenovo Voice assistant was using 50% of the CPU (it may be updating), so uninstalled that as well. As for driver updates, Lenovo Vantage software is great, check for system updates and install the updated audio drivers from there.",

Downsides would be 8Gb of RAM and a 42Whr battery. The ram is expandable to maximum of 12 or 16 gb idk. If you can look past the smaller battery, it has a freaking Oled. You might be able to get some extra battery life by using dark mode because of the Oled display.",
  "No need to go into BIOS to change performance mode, you can just change them from within windows with Lenovo Vantage. Or press Fn+Q\n\n***About the second question:-***      \nWhile AC is connected windows power modes don't really do much so you can ignore them. Between the three windows power modes there is very little difference in terms of CPU power usage (maybe 1W difference between each mode).\n\nBIOS performance modes behave exactly the same both on battery and AC. Which means TDP limits will be the same on both AC and battery. Which means if the game demands more than 25W sustained power, Intelligent cooling mode will limit performance.\n\n***About the first question:***\n\n**Under low load:-**   \nThe difference in battery life will only be caused by the fact that extreme performance mode likes to enable the fans even under very light load.\n\n**Under moderate load:-**    \nThere should be no difference for battery life and heat output in between the different BIOS power modes or windows power modes.\n\nThe reason why low and moderate load don't cause significant differences in battery life between the different power modes because the CPU only uses as much power as it needs, it is not going to consume more power if the program itself doesn't require it.\n\n**For heavy load:**\n\n**If using better battery mode (windows):**    \nThere should again be no difference in between any of the BIOS power modes.\n\n**If using better performance or best performance mode (windows):**     \nThere will be lesser battery life and greater heat output in Intelligent cooling mode compared to Battery saving mode. The difference would be greater in Extreme performance mode. However, you will also be getting better performance.",

The difference is gonna be when you do heavy CPU focused tasks which can take advantage of the 8 cores of 5700U. \n\nBut if performance isn't a priority and you're able to get other stuff of value such as bigger battery/better build/better screen etc. You can consider i5 viable since you aren't gonna take advantage of the extra cores of 5700u anyway.",

  "Acer Swift Go 14 OLED Core Ultra 5 125H- 3 months REVIEW (Indian Unit) Price- ₹60k(including Flipkart complete protection plan for 3 years)\n\nDisplay- Bright & Gorgeous OLED display. Felt slightly bit over saturated out of the box so I calibrated it a bit in the Intel Graphics command center. My preferred settings is this: Brightness enhancement at 40, contrast enhancement at 17, Hue at 0 and Saturation at 42. Check whether it suits you and calibrate accordingly. I absolutely love watching content on this. HDR is turned off by default to save battery. Turning it on changed the display colours and made it look weird. So only turn it on when watching HDR content or playing supported games. Even then you need to calibrate HDR first, use windows HDR calibration app from app Store. No complaints display wise. Remember that it's an OLED display so keep the open windows moving from time to time to avoid burn-in. Avoid static elements and turn on auto hide taskbar.\n\nSpeakers- Does the job. Nothing extraordinary. I always use my headphones so haven't tested them too much though.\n\nCamera & Mic- Camera quality is better than expected. Has a physical shutter. I take my WhatsApp video calls from my laptop primarily now. Audio transmission is also good as per people I talk to.. I never heard myself obviously.\n\nKeyboard & Trackpad- Typing experience is decent. Trackpad works fine but I've noticed that if a full sleeve or a piece of paper touches even the corner of the trackpad, it won't register your finger touch. Feels like a glass touchpad to the touch. The swift logo and media control buttons look cool when glowing , you can adjust their brightness via the Acer Sense app. Media control only works for OTT and YouTube, no media player support yet. There's a fingerprint scanner on top right which works well. Also, has co-pilot shortcut instead of right control which can be reprogrammed using Microsoft Power tools. Also, 1 little thing.. The keyboard backlight turns on to full brightness every time you restart your PC regardless of where you left it, no way to fix it. Also there's no way to always keep them on, they turn off after a few seconds and turn back on when you stop typing, maybe it's a battery saving feature. There's also a key to toggle microphone access.  I searched everywhere for a keyboard cover for this particular laptop, and [this](https://ifyxstore.com/products/silicone-keyboard-skin-cover-for-acer-swift-go-acer-swift-3-14-laptop-2023transparent?keyword=acer) is the only one I found that fits. Not expensive but doesn't have cut-out for fingerprint scanner so you have to manually cut a hole if you want.\n\nPorts & Buttons- 1 USB A port on Each side. 2 USB C ports on the left. 1 headphone jack on the right. MicroSD card reader slot in right. HDMI port on left. Overall satisfied.\n\nBuild quality- Full metal body. Feels solid. But still it feels lighter than it should. Just 1.3kgs. Lid can be opened with 1 hand and has a subtle protrusion at the middle(always open the lid from the middle). Hinges feel strong yet smooth. Opening the lid raises the laptop a bit which theoretically should help with heat dissipation. The vents are just below the display and just at the top of the keyboard area so the air output is thrown straight at the screen. I don't know the long term ramifications of such design choices but in my use case the fans don't turn on much.\n\nBattery & Charging- I have capped it at 80% from day 1 and battery saver indication comes at 30%, so I charge it when it reaches around 20-25%. So, in between I get 5 hours of screen on time on an average in normal mode(Acer sense app). I'm not a power user but this is still a H series processor. My brightness stays at 10% most of the time. Refresh rate at 90hz. I mostly watch movies & shows, work on chrome, have discord running all the time and a few other background apps as well. I have WiFi, bluetooth connected all the time. It charges from 20% to 80% in about 30 mins. So, yeah fast enough. However, the area around the charging point gets considerably hot. I even tried exchanging my unit but the service center guy assured me this won't be an issue in the long run and given that it's a metal body, it's to be expected. And yeah Acer has always been notorious with respect to heat management. But I was aware of this when I purchased the laptop. I got a cooling pad and turn it on while charging or doing file transfers.. It helps immensely.\n\nPerformance- again, I'm not a power user.. No video rendering or anything.. so for me, it flies.. no issues whatsoever performance wise. Quick to load, keeps tabs open, all that. \n\nI tried to sum up as much as I could remember.. Ask me if you wanna know something else specifically.. also read this guy's [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcerOfficial/s/7zuBiKYgCO).. it's way better than mine.",
  "Is this repair guy lying to me? (Lenovo Legion 5 not able to charge, says he needs to replace the entire board) Sorry for the long post I just feel like I need to write this all down for my sanity.\n\nI'm a computer science major in university so I use my laptop (Lenovo Legion 5, I7 core, NVdia Geforce GTX, \\~4 yrs old) a ton as I don't have a desktop. A few days ago I worked on my laptop earlier in the morning, then later in the day plugged it in and it wasn't able to turn on at all. I let it sit for a few hours and then I was able to turn it on but it stopped being able to charge. Figured it was a problem with the charging port since I tried with another charger and it wouldn't work, was planning on fixing it myself until I saw that you needed to solder off the charging port to replace it and decided it was too risky/high effort to do myself.\n\nTook it to a local mom and pop place with high reviews (4.9 stars on Google with 121 reviews). They seemed relatively trustworthy, said they had an open shop policy so let us look over their shoulder when they first opened the laptop up, didn't have us sign anything suspicious, was clearly a family running the store together (and had a cute dog which may/may not have swayed my opinion a lot).\n\nThey opened it up but didn't seem too clear on what was wrong with it and says that they'll need to take it all apart to figure out the issue, mentioned that a lot of the screws came loose from me using it so much, that there was a lot of lint/dust in the fans and that they were surprised something didn't go wrong with it earlier and held the open laptop to show us. This kind of matched up since the laptop has gone through a lot (one time the keyboard stopped working, it has a crack in the plastic part, occasionally gets the blue screen of death after I took a coding class that messes with the memory a lot), so I figured it was just worse off than I thought. Gave a final estimate of the repair being 50-289$ and 2-3 days to complete, and I paid 50$ down for the inspection of the issue that counts towards the total cost of the repair.\n\nA full day passes and so I call the place asking for an update. The dad of the shop says that he was working all morning on my laptop. Says he needs to replace the entire board and has been looking online for one. Says that he found that a screw came loose and grounded somewhere on the board and basically blew some stuff up. Specifically listed that a capacitor, the mother board, and the input charger was shot though seemed to vaguely imply there were other parts affected. Says he has taken pictures of all of it for me. Then he says he'll call back with the price the board would be so that I could decide if it was worth paying much more for it.\n\nCalls back in a couple of minutes and says that the part is only available in China and will be 599.99$ to replace. I ask if the repair will end up costing more than 599.99$ due to labor costs and he very adamantly says that he does flat pricing and that it will only be 599.99$. I say that I want to take it somewhere else to get a second opinion. At first he says that \"oh but this is board problem and I'm the only person in town who is able to do that\" and trails off before adding that he has already replaced the mousepad (apparently was burned all the way through) and one of the capacitor and trails off again, that the laptop is all opened up and he would need to put everything back together for someone else to look at. I eventually say that I am going to come 2 days later (since I am busy tomorrow and the day after) to look at it in person, see his pictures and then decide if I want to get a second opinion.\n\nHonestly I was just lying and I think no matter what I am taking it to get a second opinion. But I'm worried still mostly because I feel like the scenarios are:\n\n* They're well-meaning but confused, laptop can actually be fixed at much lower price somewhere else (best case)\n* They're lying about the state of the laptop to get more money -- it can be repaired at a much lower price somewhere else and they let me do that (basically same as best case but makes me feel worse)\n* They're right and the laptop does need its board entirely replaced for high price\n* They're lying about the state of the laptop and now since I've pressed to see it in person and view the pictures, they're going to deliberately damage it to corroborate their story (worst case)\n\nAnd I'm very worried that it'll be the latter story. This is especially because I didn't take pictures of the interior of the laptop beforehand.\n\nIn general though I feel like it's very suspicious. The kind of damage that messes up the whole board I feel like should have been much more noticeable and I'm honestly not even sure how a screw could have come loose and damaged the board like that. I also just find it weird because the laptop was perfectly functional -- just not able to charge but the damage he is describing seems like it would also affect the laptop's function aside from the charging. Out of the very few bad reviews one person had a very similar story about having to get a part from China and it being very expensive which is boggling my mind now (attached image below). I'm not even sure if I can get my 50$ back which really bothers me. But then again if they do genuinely need the part I feel like it would be that price in which case is this even a bad deal?\n\nI'm just feeling duped right now and need a sanity check / some advice on how to proceed :(\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1vi93uwz4dzd1.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=96bb4bfb8cfeee35f4042c18fbf65a1f6dea65c7\n\n",
  "Doesn't really matter if htey're lying or not.  $600 to repair a 4 year old laptop is ALMOST never worth it.  AT BEST, that's like $100 less than the laptop is still worth.  At worst, it's worth maybe 1/2 that.  Just say the parts too expensive and you want your laptop back.\n\nThe $50 deposit is generally considered non-refundable as that's the \"if we take the time to open it up and see what's wrong, this is the labor fee for doing that\".  This is pretty industry standard practice, and you'll find it at just about anyplace that does repairs where they need to do troubleshooting.\n\nGet the laptop back, write off the $50 as what it cost to find out, and get something else.",
  "I had a very similar experience with my Lenovo ThinkPad E14 here in India. Fortunately, the local service centre I went to were honest enough to accept that they can not repair the board. They tried changing the Power IC in the charging circuit and failed twice. The laptop wouldn't turn on even after repeated attempts. After 5 days, they finally returned the laptop without even charging a service fee. I took the laptop to a more experienced local service centre (guy with more than 35 yrs in the business, he also services all the laptops of an IT organization run by my dad's close friend), and explained everything in detail. He said he'll try to do his best to repair it but after 2 days of toiling, even he couldn't fix it. Changing the Power IC continued to short the motherboard resulting in the power not being delivered to the main processor. He was somehow able to get it to turn on though. He suggested I change the motherboard and quoted a decent price for it. Since the laptop was just one year old, and the motherboard costed 1/3rd the cost of the laptop, I decided to go for it instead of buying a new laptop. \n\nIn your case, I would strongly suggest you to be firm on taking it elsewhere for a second opinion. And if it still costs $600 to repair, you would definitely be better off buying a new laptop by pooling in $200-300 extra especially during the upcoming sales in the US.\n\nMore details on the problem I faced with my laptop here - https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/s/v49ca28ilk",

So, had to move to ASUS TUF models\n\n Now, I am confused whether to go for AMD Ryzen CPUs on ASUS laptop at 60-62k price or for Intel CPUs on MSI (I will extend warranty for its customer service).? Only if Ryzen 5 or 7 (7\\*\\*\\* HS variant series) is great enough in comparison to i5-12th gen CPUs. \n\n After all, ASUS TUF is selling Intel CPU i5-12th gen at higher price than AMD Ryzen CPUs with other specifications same. So, Intel CPUs will be of course better than AMD Ryzen series.\n\n I am adding another flexibility & open for any recommendation for specifications change, series/model change like shall I get MSI Cyborg with i5-13th gen or consider i7 CPUs or any other GPU or a budget increase. Now, the prices have dropped at online stores due to festival offers here at India. \n\n And, my graphics usage exclusively may be for DaVinci Resolve might create a problem but then I am okay if its in this budget to use Adobe Premier Pro, Filmora or Shotcut.",

  "Thanks mate, hope I had got a reply from you sooner but I already made the purchase. But, I have to be honest with you as before your reply, I had already made the order from the same seller on Amazon which is mentioned in the link you have provided. Seller :- Clicktech Retail on Amazon.\n\nThe person whom I took a suggestion suggested MSI or Asus because of its hardware. And, even I know Acer laptops are good. The Predator series & even Acer laptops have durability. My cousin got an Acer from her maternal uncle.\n\nI think the model that you have given has 6GB of VRAM which is its USP in compare to what specifications I have provided, models & their price. Its definitely in my budget under 60k.\n\nMay be down the line, I will see if I can exchange my particular model with the one you have send if my GPU computing power does not meet my requirements. \n\nI am looking for a job in Software again after a brief period of career gap. Else, I could have easily spent more bucks but this Acer model was within my budget else I could have chosen 3060 or 3050Ti.\n\nBut, seriously thanks mate for the model. Its a nice one.",
  "ASUS TUF A15, Lenovo LOQ 15 or Lenovo Legion Slim 5 with slightly lower specs? I’m an architecture student, I want a budget-friendly gaming laptop that is strong for renders and 3D softwares, also I don’t own a PS5 or a next-gen gaming console, which might be the case for a long while, so I want a laptop that also performs well in games. I currently have 3 options that I cannot decide between:\n\n1-ASUS TUF A15 Ryzen 7 7735hs RTX 4060 8gb VRAM 1080p 144hz\n\n2-Lenovo LOQ 15 intel i7 13620h RTX 4060 8gb 1080p 144hz\n\n3-Lenovo Legion Slim 5 intel i7 13700h RTX 4050 6gb VRAM 2K display 165hz\n\nThe ASUS is the cheapest, with both the LOQ and the Legion being equally priced. I went to a store and asked one of the workers there about the ASUS and told me so many good stuff about it compared to the LOQ, such as the cooling system and build quality, but watching reviews on this model of ASUS, all comments on it are kinda mixed which makes me scared of getting it, I’m more convinced about getting the LOQ because I heard it has a better display which is something that strongly matters to me. \n\nAs for the Legion, I heard that it’s the BEST budget gaming laptop there is, though considering that it’s gpu is 4050 instead of 4060, it makes me scared of regretting my purchase, since 4060 is significantly better than the 4050.\n\nSorry for all of this text, but I would love some advice, if it is based on personal experience that would be a lot better, but all suggestions are welcome, thanks! :))\n\n",
  "I'd do the LOQ or the Legion in your scenario. I know they're promising to be better but the ASUS support stories still scare the shit out of me. I really wouldn't trust in-store workers on anything, they're just trying to sell you stuff. \n\nMeanwhile I've used Lenovo support multiple times for repairs and full part replacements without problems. The 4060 will be way, way better than the 4050, so the LOQ is the best bang for your buck. I have an LOQ with a 7840HS and a mobile 4060 and it's basically my workstation now as well - it plays all games at high/ultra and doesn't have any problems. Had this for almost a year now with no problems.",
  "Thank you for the suggestion! I’ve been thinking about getting the LOQ too, but I haven’t heard great stuff about the thermals and the build quality. Does the build quality feel cheap? Or is it durable enough? And is the cooling good when playing games?",
  "Black Friday buying advice This post is for anyone looking to buy a laptop that is at least 1 tier above trash, with info on CAD, gaming, general use and more. I edit this several times a day.\n\nI have created a subreddit dedicated to helping people with tech. Check it out at r/TOOsTechTactics\n\nPlease go here for updated guide. https://www.reddit.com/r/TOOsTechTactics/s/wMiIvI1fDA\nThis post is a little bit of a mess, and it will not be updated anymore. Seriously, if you see this, go to the updated one.\n\nConsidering how well I feel like this post did, I will create a similar post for next year, hopefully with a more intuitive format and more information. Links to all my favorite experts as well. \n\nThis is an informative post not an English lesson.\n\nTo start, laptops come in a huge variety of types and form factors and sizes and specs. There is a huge market for laptops and many people are overwhelmed with their choices. This post will help you choose a laptop with decent specs, however it will not be indicative of things like build quality and warranty. Let's make a few things very clear right off the bat.\n\n1. Use caution when buying anything online.\n2. Never buy from Temu. Among many reasons for that, Temu is China. Literally just China.\n3. Laptops are expensive. Sorry.\n4. One brand can have great super high end laptops and at the same time try to sell you e-waste like it's a bargain. This is why I cannot recommend certain brands. That's a whole book's worth of information.\n5. There is no perfect universal laptop.\n6. Ask a question I haven't addressed here and if I deem it worthy I will post info about it here.\n7. I want to hear if you got a good laptop based on this post, please and thank you. This is to improve my future posts.\n8. If you are nervous about buying online, try going to a Best Buy. That's an (American Big Box Tech Retailer) tech store. Do be aware that they will try to sell you a computer like a car dealer tries to sell you a car. They will help you. If they don't, well...\n9. If you want to ask anyone for tech advice, you gotta realize that it is work. It's work. There is no secret formula to get you the perfect device.\n10. Specs are one thing, but build quality and actual performance are another. Some laptops will break really easily. Some 5KUSD laptops break easily because they use plastic hinges. Acknowledge that not every tech person has handled and used for 5 years every laptop that has come out of the market. We cannot predict failures such as these. \n11. If you ask me for any advice, take it with this in mind. I will do my best, and I will tell you if something is wildly overpriced, or a scam, or not good enough. However, I would rather you overpay for a great laptop than not have a good enough laptop. \n12. As per expert and enthusiast recommendation, batteries should be replaced around every two years, because all lithium ion batteries will degrade in health and capacity over time. You can alleviate, but in no way prevent this decline by keeping your battery temperature at an acceptable level. Among other things, that is the most simple. Battery replacement can be delayed, but you risk battery expansion (look up spicy pillow syndrome, severe cases can destroy your device, either by chemical or physical means.) and you will live with reduced capacity over time.\n13. If your laptop is slow and clunky, there are some simple things you can do to speed it up yourself. Free things you can do, uninstall programs you do not use, and disable startup programs you do not use. This will free up system resources. You can easily look up how to do this faster than I can type out a reply of: go look it up yourself. You can also clean out your laptop. This is done by opening up your laptop and cleaning away dust and debris. This is especially important with laptops that have a fan intake for cooling. These can get dirty very quickly. The next thing that you can do is shop online for thermal paste. What you can do is you can repaste the chips on your CPU and GPU. The paste I use is Artic MX 4, and it costs around $4-12USD. Very good price. You will find that your computer may already have paste, but it could be old and failing, making your computer overheat. Temperature control is extremely important for computers. You would find it preferable to have your computer reach its maximum performance before it reaches its maximum temperature. You can look up a how to video online to find a step by step video guide on how to repaste your computer. Make sure to include your specific model in your search results. The last thing that you can do, and is also most expensive, is replace your HDD and your RAM. If your laptop has 4GB 8GB of RAM, consider buying an upgrade. Look up your computer model and find the type of RAM it uses. Then buy a lot of comparable RAM that has a higher capacity than what you already have. Don't ask me how to do it, just look it up. If your laptop has a hard drive (HDD), it is likely slowing down your computer a lot. You can purchase a SATA SSD for 20x to 200x faster speeds than HDD. This does not mean your computer will be 20x to 200x faster, but it will surely be a noticeable improvement. This will require purchasing an SATA SSD that matches the size you require, and then also buying a SATA to USB converter. You will then have to download a specialized program to clone your HDD to your SSD. This is a complicated process, but it is worth it for those who want to save a buck. This requires much research and patience. If you don't want to do any of this, or your laptop is simply a potato anyways, then it is time to buy a new laptop. Believe it or not, every laptop has a time where it is wholly inadequate.\n\nWith that out of the way here is information:\n\nAs you read, you will find scattered segments on different topics. Make sure you skim through and make sure something you may want to read about is typed about. \n\nMy friend, if you are wanting to buy a laptop that will last more than 2 years, you will need to spend at least $400USD. Add $100USD for each year. If you are not an experienced buyer, this is a good rule of thumb. Make sure that the laptop can have its battery replaced, as they should be replaced every 2 years.\n\nAs you read this, you will find more information, but this is my general spec advice when purchasing any laptop meant to last at least 2 years and perform optimally.\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5 11th Generation up, Intel Core Ultra 5 up, or Ryzen 5 5600X and up (I am not familiar with Ryzen Processors)\nGPU: (for gamers and professional users) NVIDIA RTX 3070 up.\nRAM: 24GB or more type DDR4 or DDR5 and up. LPDDR is essentially the name for RAM for laptops. \n\nThose are my recommendations for decently spec'd laptop. \n\nCompare two laptops? There is stuff out there. You can test specific parts using UserBenchmark.com or even the whole computer in the same place. Do note that many enthusiasts will stand behind Userbenchmark and others hate it. Alternatives are CPUMark for CPU's, 3DMark for Graphics cards, and Notebookcheck for the more advanced user with the tradeoff of more accurate data.) This only shows data of people testing your exact same computer, it isn't predictive. Take it with a grain of salt. Should not be your primary method of making a purchase decision.\n\nIntel Core i3's are the lowest tier of Intel Core.\nIntel Core i9's are the highest tier, but you don't need an i9 unless you are doing serious heavy lifting with your laptop or any computer.\nAn Intel Core i3 14th Gen can easily beat out a core i9 5th Gen. Generation matters so much when it comes to Intel CPU's.\nIntel Core Ultras are slightly less powerful than Intel Cores, but more efficient. They are also a new technology. \nSnapdragon X or Snapdragon Elite processors are basically really supe'd up mobile phone processors. Very efficient. Still decently powerful. Any Intel Core Ultra or Snapdragon processor is going to be a decent if not great processor. (For those interested in snapdragon processors, please see my segment on it)\nCore Ultra's naming scheme is alot like Intel Core naming scheme. Intel Core Ultra 9 is the most powerful, with Intel Core Ultra 5 being lowest tier (Intel Core i3 is lowest tier for Intel Core Processors). Intel Core Ultra and Intel Core have a difference, but the Ultra in Intel Core Ultra does not mean that they are better than Intel Core. Intel Core Ultra processors are a new type of processor that is less powerful than an Intel Core with the benefit of higher efficiency. It also seems that Intel Core Ultra is to be found with \"AI\" laptops. Intel Core uses more power, but is more powerful. Intel Core Ultra is just a different and newer architecture of processor, but just because it is new does not mean it is inherently better. It is important to note that the Core Ultra Processors manage to have a huge advantage over Intel Core Processors with the sheer efficiency.\nIntel Celeron's are the basic of basic processors. New Celeron's are actually pretty decent, but they are not nearly as good as even an i3. If you see an ad for a Celeron, don't buy unless you want the bare minimum. Just don't. Pentium is slightly better than Celeron, the tier above. Same book as Celeron, just don't. \n\nBelow is some really complex information on the naming scheme of Intel Processors. This can help for fine tuning a decision. You don't have to know this, but it can help. Feel free to scroll past this if you need to.\n\nThe naming schemes of CPU's are created to be as specific as possible, and at a glance an enthusiast can identify the processor, but it is confusing for the general consumer. Let's start with Intel Core Ultra processors.\nLet’s take the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, for example:\nThe ‘Core Ultra’ is the processor’s name.\nThe ‘7’ represents the brand level, indicating the processor’s performance tier. Other tiers include 5, and 9. The higher the brand level, the more powerful and capable the CPU is.\nThe ‘1’ shows the processor series. As new series are released, this number will go up, like in the Intel Core Ultra 9 288V, where the ‘2’ represents a newer series.\nThe ’55’ is the SKU, which isnt important for the everyday consumer.\nThe suffix ‘H’ indicates the processor type, with the H-series focused on high performance for laptops. Likewise, if you see the suffix ‘U’, it means it’s a power-efficient chipset. This applies to Intel Core as well.\nFor Intel Core Processors:\nCore i7-14650HX as an example.\nThe ‘i7’ is the tier indicator. i3 to i9.\nThe ’14’ indicates the generation of the processor. So, ’14’ signifies a 14th Gen processor. Similarly, ’13’ or ’12’ would denote the 13th or 12th Gen processors, respectively.\nThe ‘650’ is the SKU, which isn't important for the everyday consumer.\nThe ‘HX’ suffix indicates the sub performance of the Processor. A \"U\" designation means it's a \"mobile\" chip, meaning less powerful but more efficient.\n\nA little bit more hard to digest information, I promise it gets easier. \n\nSuffix\tMeaning for the letters you will see on the end of some CPU processors for laptops.\nHX\tHigh-end gaming or workstation laptops where maximum performance and multitasking are essential. Keep this one cool, or your going to cook your laptop.\nHK\tFor gaming laptops, unlocked for easy overclocking, which means shoving more power into your CPU to make it perform faster than it's Base level. While this isn't inherently dangerous, you need to keep the processor cool to do this, and it can reduce the lifespan of the CPU, which is going to be far longer than the rest of the laptop anyways.\nH\tHigh-performance laptops for gaming, content creation, or heavy multitasking.\nU\tPower-efficient chips for everyday tasks like web browsing or productivity, designed for long battery life. \n\nGPU's are just as important as CPU's if you want to use your laptop for media creation, gaming, and creation software that is used professionally and not casually. This includes CAD software like Autodesk Inventor, Blender, etc. \nMost popular GPU's on market are NVIDIA GPU's\n3050 minimum.\n4090, you are just being overkill. \n30, 40 is the generation.\n50, 90 is the tier.\nAs a side note, NVIDIA 50 series GPU's are on their way, so make sure to keep an eye out if you are interested.\nDon't expect any gaming or graphically intensive processing without a dGPU, that means a GPU separate from the ones that are built into CPU's. \n\nRAM is going to be the second most important item for general performance other than the CPU, unless you are a gamer and have a GPU. RAM is your computers short term memory. It really needs this so that things run quickly and smoothly. 16GB of RAM is decent, even great today. But in a year, it may not be so. I suggest a 24GB RAM minimum. 32GB is going to be a more common option though. If you absolutely cannot afford the 32GB option, don't panic, but realize that you may get hurt from it down the road.\nIt is important to note that your RAM is the single biggest determining factor in the lifespan of your laptop. The more RAM, the longer it will last (basically). If your computer starts acting choppy or slow, it could be a RAM issue.\n\nAs of current, an NPU (of what makes an AI chips so special) is (to my understanding) a bit of a marketing thing. They do have real use, but it's not anything your GPU cannot do. Industry is planning on having computers natively compute AI tasks, and that is what the NPU is for. Thing is that those chips are the absolute bare minimum, and the reason why is that we have no actual application made for them, yet.\n\nIf you go on Reddit asking me or anyone else to look at a prospective buy, you gotta realize 3 things. 1, we are not wizards. There is no secret formula. 2. We need details. What do you use it for, what games, photos? Every single detail. You got kids? Will it be treated nicely? Every single detail. 3, I can speak for all tech people that we have never tested every single laptop in existence. Some 2-3,000USD laptops suffer from poor build quality. That's real. And the truth is the industry as a whole actually really wants your money. I can only recommend based on specs, but not build quality. As far as I know, Apple products and Microsoft Surface products are the two suppliers where I can confidently say that you will get a premium build quality (almost) every single time, however these devices are also extremely difficult and expensive to repair.\n\nI suggest at least an 8th Gen Intel Core i5 (i5-8200 for example) with at with 12GB RAM as the bare minimum. For more than 2 years, I recommend at least 12th Generation Intel i5 (i5-12200 or similar) and at least 24GB RAM. Intel's latest Generation of Core CPU's are 14th generation. Those are solid chips. Intel Core Ultras are also really good, but you trade the raw power of Intel Cores for more efficiency. AMD chips are not as common on laptops as Intel Chips are, but do not underestimate AMD. Getting an Intel Core i9 anything is overkill. Even for the best of gamers, Intel Core i7 is just fine. Unless you are doing engineering work or have a computer that requires extreme processing power, not gaming power, but processing power, then you get an Intel Core i9. 256GB of storage is just fine unless you want to store your photos and videos on it. 512GB up depending on how much you want to put on it. Another thing to look out for is SSD vs HDD. You can often get more storage with a HDD, but an SSD is so much faster. Also, once your computer shoots it's last electrical pulse, and it will someday, all you have to do to get all your photos back is to take the SSD and have someone clone it. Basically take it to your local computer repair shop, and if you know what you are doing, you can DIY it (if you know what you are doing). In the case of an HDD failure, you may have to spend thousands to get your data back. It's a spinning disk (HDD) vs (in really basic terms) a super fast USB stick or super fast phone storage (SSD). \n\nIt is important to note the difference between RAM and Storage. \nRAM often comes in configurations like 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, and as stated above, is important for doing tasks quickly. Storage on the other hand, requires a part called an SSD (Solid State Drive)(Modern laptops should not have an HDD - Hard Disk Drive - because they are much slower. However, they are supreme in the amount of storage they can hold. You can buy 24TB HDD off the market. Data hoarder?) an SSD that you find in a laptop will typically have configurations of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB. One TB (Terabyte) is equal to about 1024GB (Gigabytes). KB<MB<GB<TB<PB<YB<whytheheckdoyouneedthatmuchstorage Your SSD will hold things like Photos, videos, games, and more. \n\nI am sorry that the market is confusing, it really is. You don't understand the difference, and that's normal, and that's not ok. Kudos to you for reaching out. I highly suggest AGAINST buying from an online retailer unless it is specifically from the brand you are buying from. No refurbished laptops online, big no no, especially if not from 1st party. Often 3rd party sellers buy defective parts for cheap and then slap together a laptop and sell it. You can get a real actual working computer that meets your specs, except it isn't a laptop because the charging mechanism is broken. Don't buy from 3rd parties online. Don't! I have discovered that going to your local computer repair shop is a fairly safe option for buying a decent computer. They can sell refurbished computers, but this time each one has had a specific time dedicated to it. Even going to Best Buy, you are more likely to overpay for a great laptop than you are likely to overpay for a crappy laptop. If you buy on Amazon or online at all, no third party retailers even if the price is 200USD cheaper. You will lose out on something every time. Also make sure the seller is in your region. Let's say you live in USA Asus sold you a nice laptop at a nice price. 2 months later it dies on you. You go to Asus for the warranty. Well. You bought your laptop from  ASUS Germany which serves, idk, Europe. They won't give you the warranty because you live in the US. This has happened before folks and will continue to happen. Buy from the correct region.\n\nElectronics are expensive, if you buy a cheap price of crap, can you really expect it to work like a premium item? \n\nDo not buy Chromebooks unless you specifically know what it is. Chromebooks seem appealing and are very cheap, and the battery life is really good. However, there is a reason the battery life is so good. The stuff inside it is so weak, it needs so little power, that that battery lasts forever. It's not as bad as having wait times so high it negates the long battery life, but you are still sacrificing performance. I have also discovered that Chromebooks are very limited in compatibility. The apps that you use on your Windows computer sometimes cannot be used on Chromebook. Is there a fix? Probably not one that someone needs help buying a laptop can do. ChromeOS is a flavor of Linux Debian, which is another way of saying it's closer to a crappy, not well made android phone than it is Windows, which is highly polished with wide compatibility. That being said, Chromebooks so have a use. They are awesome low end devices. Anything to be done in a browser can be done in a Chromebook, just don't expect much performance from it. I say this because I myself have a Chromebook, and multiple windows devices. Chromebook is gr8 if you are an android person. Also Chromebook is natively Linux, if you are that kind of person who would want to know that.\n\nWindows is terrible with low end devices. Chromebook was created for them.\n\nYou think a MacBook or an Apple computer will suit your needs better than a Windows or Chromebook? Never buy the baseline. Ever. Always go at least 1 tier above the baseline. It's an expensive bullet to bite, but it won't be more expensive than buying an underpowered laptop. 16GB RAM is actually fine with MacOS because it's built differently from windows. However, never expect to do any heavy lifting with a MacOS system unless you pay several thousand USD for a ridiculously locked down device (see upgrading your SSD for new Mac pros that cost a black market heart). What you gain with Mac is the Apple ecosystem, which is honestly great for the average consumer, and you lose on performance and compatibility, along with customization. You can also get locked out of switching to windows, its just more difficult to switch back, files etc. I will say again, never buy the baseline Apple Product, and remember that you will not be able to upgrade it.\n\nI've seen lots of computers and laptops that say starting at x price and the starting at is absolutely terrible. Look above for your minimums. Do they meet?\n\nSame with buying any cheap laptop. Business knows you don't know what you are buying. If you see anything 4GB or 8GB RAM, STAY AWAY!\n\nYou may see on your listing for a laptop that a battery will last 12 hours. If you look closer you will notice an asterisk. Usually, a manufacturer will place a laptop in \"optimal\" conditions and measure battery life under that. Never expect your laptop to reach an advertised battery life.\n\nSnapdragon processors:\nSnapdragon processors are not the new kids on the block. They have silently been sitting in phones for a while now, but recently, they have appeared in laptops as extremely efficient processors. (Important side note here, AMD has come out with its own line of extremely efficient processors, but they can't compare in price, and that is why the Snapdragon processor shines. More on those coming soon.) Snapdragon processors are based off of a different architecture, and so lots of compatibility issues can arise. Expect most video games to not work, so don't get for your kid. You can expect anything that you do in a browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, TOR) to work very well. You may very well go several days with hours on hours of use to go by without the need to charge. This is perfect for people who only use stuff like browsers. They are also often cheaper, but you can fill in that cheap price with nice things like an OLED display or more RAM. They tend to be very light as well. In essence, snapdragon processors are perfect for those that use things like YouTube and Facebook alot, as you access those through your browser. There have been some issues that have come up with snapdragon computers, and this is because they are a new tech. Any new tech has issues. (Self driving cars, first phones, first computers, AI) And any issues are being smoothed out and will continue to get better. If this sounds good but you want to avoid any issues, you can always wait for the next generation of snapdragon processors to come out. The specialists that work on the creation of the processors will have gathered data on issues and fixed many of them by then. No games. Exceptional for browser usage, better than MacBook battery life.\nOn that note, experts have compared a Snapdragon laptop as a laptop that has better battery life and can do more. (Sick burn) While the Snapdragon processor has some compatibility issues, it is still a Windows machine, which is so much more compatible than laptops that have MacOS.\n\nIf you want a real laptop, start with Business class laptops or laptops aimed at businesses. There are many many alternatives, but one name brand business grade laptop that is reputable are the Dell Latitudes, and another is HP Envy, and another is Lenovo ThinkPads. They can be expensive, but it's a very decent system. For the average consumer, they are a good option. Business class laptops are really good buys, because generally, a business will make a deal with a company, say Dell. Dell wants to keep their contract with this business. To make sure that the business does not switch to Lenovo, they have to make a laptop that will not break down and is easy to fix. Business class laptops also tend to have more documentation and manuals available. The business wants good computers that don't break down, and Dell wants to keep its contract. Thus, the business class laptop is born.\n\nGaming laptop for your kid? Anything less than $600USD is a waste of your time. Expect to spend $800USD. If it doesn't have a discreet graphics card, don't buy it. (For serious gamers only)\n\nIf you are looking to buy a laptop with an Intel Core i7 12th generation and are buying it for your kid to play Roblox, it will be just fine. Same with Minecraft Bedrock or Java Edition. Fortnite, on the edge, anything more sophisticated, and your computer will likely struggle.\n\nFor those not knowing difference between Minecraft Java and Minecraft Bedrock, Because Minecraft is hands down, yes you too conservative grandpa, Minecraft is one of the most if not the most influential game of all time, (this is my personal opinion). Minecraft Java Edition is more CPU intensive, needing better CPU, but is also less microtransactions, more moddable, and has your kids Favorite servers (2B2T for that concerning kid). Bedrock still has popular servers (you will get all those mini games like PVP and bed wars) but is more compatible, playable on phone, PC, and console. I prefer Java, but that's my personal brew. \n\nIf you want a laptop for your kid to play games on like Roblox, Minecraft, or Fortnite, you will need to spend at least $500 for an Awesome Parent Worthy gaming experience. \n\nSome good gaming laptop brands: Acer Nitros, ROG Zephyrus, and Lenovo Legions, and MSI.\n\nSpeaking of Gaming, ever heard of a Nintendo switch? The handheld one? Well, imagine that, but it's a windows computer instead. Now imagine that exists. Now stop, because it does. Unfortunately, I am very poor, but if I was granted a wish, I would get the ASUS ROG ALLY X (yes caps needed). It's a super powerful handheld machine for around $800 ($700USD Back Friday). Yeah, it's expensive. It's older brother, the ROG ALLY is going for around $500. It's a neat machine, and you can hook a monitor up to them and definitely use it as a gaming rig or workstation. Alternatives are currently the MSI CLAW or Lenovo Legion Go. For gamers, another alternative is the SteamDeck and the SteamDeck OLED. Very good machines, as in AAA games good machines, take a look if you are interested. Maybe it's just got a gold filter over it with me, but I think it's freaking cool.\n\nFor those looking for serious gaming laptops, try looking for an at least Intel Core i7 12th Generation with an H or HX or K at the end of the CPU model name. These letters indicate the performance. Also recommend at least a NVIDIA RTX 4080 or equivalent as very high performance. You really don't need more than 60FPS for biological reasons, but 120Hz is where your brain basically caps out. 240hz is another very small increment of improvemenr, but not a lot. I suggest a minimum of 32GB of RAM.\n\nFramework is a relatively new company that specializes is extremely customizable laptops, and you can easily buy one framework laptop and have it last as long as you want because you can simply replace the parts. If you are willing to pay extra for great laptop, with customizability, look no further than framework. Before you ask me what to get, how about you do an internet search first. \n\nFor people just looking for a laptop with a really nice display, OLED displays are widely regarded as absolutely beautiful. The blacks are truly black, and that makes for a world of difference in regards to contrast. They can suck extra battery though.\n\nFor those looking for content creation laptops, if you draw or create videos regularly, you should look into an external storage device, particularly an SSD for that durability. I personally have a Samsung T7 and I love it. However you may find others at better prices. Keep in mind that so many listings are scams, it's mindblowing. There are many \"2 in 1\" laptops that people seem to like. Go find one if you need one.\n\nFor those looking for laptops used for coding, you will want a laptop with a decent CPU. For great performance I suggest an Intel Core i7 at least 11th Generation, or an Intel Core Ultra 7.\n\nFor those going into day trading, I suggest a gaming laptop or similar. If you need fast response times from your computer, you need a powerful laptop, because those milliseconds matter. Also consider getting an Ethernet port for direct connection to your router. This eliminates any instability that can occur with Wi-Fi, especially if you live in a crowded area or have many devices.\n\nPeople have asked if Intel 13th Generation processors have issues. They did at one point. In technical terms processors had a fault in their microcode algorithm that saw them request elevated operating voltages from the motherboard. That can cause instability because too high a voltage can wear chips like these out with time. Basically they were misbehaving. Intel and it's partners have fixes this by releasing BIOS updates, so if you have an issue, update your computer. The problem is largely resolved.\n\nI just typed this out, but it didn't save. Ugh!\nIt is important to know the difference between Windows Pro and Windows Home. Often, you will feel that with Windows Pro, you will get a better product. There is one large thing that is relevant to the consumer that you get with Windows Pro. Bitlocker (more on that soon). With Windows Pro, you get the ability to use Microsoft Remote Desktop. A remote desktop allows you to use a computer you own like you are sitting next to it. For example, let's say I am at work, 50 miles away from my desktop at home. With Windows 10 Pro on my desktop, and Home on my laptop, I can log into my computer at home (assuming it is on and set up) and then I can control my home desktop as if I was there. Super cool. Microsoft remote desktop works best (extra config needed if outside home) inside your own network. This basically means you have to be inside the same wifi, home, apartment, building to use  Microsoft Remote Desktop. Alternatives that are also free that I use is Chrome Remote Desktop, and Parsec, and those do not require windows Pro. I can control my computer from anywhere with these. Remember to never give people access to remote desktop on your computer unless you know them. Scammers do this often to steal your money and data. Other features of Windows Pro are better ability to control systems (IT for school or business) and overall many features that are useful for business. I do not remember each and every one because those that I do not remember were not important enough for me to remember. \n\nAnother large feature of Windows Pro that is actually useful to you is BitLocker. Bitlocker is a program that runs on your computer all the time to encrypt all do your data. Your computer is the only computer that can read this data. This encryption is so hard to crack, that the United States Government would have a very difficult (not impossible) time of decrypting your data. Bitlocker will protect your data, but not your device. If your device gets stolen, nobody can read your data (government documents, corporate emails, etc.) If your device gets stolen, you lose the device and data, but whoever stole the device gets only the device, not the data. Because your device is the only computer that can read your data, if your laptop breaks and you want to get the photos off of your SSD, it will be basically impossible to get your data back. It is encrypted and gone. Bitlocker is often enabled by default on windows pro devices. This means that if you forget your password and you have a windows pro devices, you are probably very very screwed. I highly recommend to learn how to get and retrieve your blocker encryption key, this is a 25 character password. I suggest you make physical copies, take photos and also keep a copy where you keep documents such as birth certificates and passports. If you do not want Bitlocker, you can turn it off. Basically your computer will take a minute to decrypt your drive and you won't lose anything, it just removes the encryption and makes it so no encryption will happen in the future. Normal retrievable files and data. I suggest this if you are not worried about having your data stolen, but are worried about accidentally making it completely unretrieveable. \n\nSystems with higher Specs are going to tend to have lower battery life and higher temperatures. This is normal. However, in my opinion, the low battery life can be attributed to the 100WHr limit on batteries, as it is hard to transport these high power density batteries due to regulation. Manufacturers also neglect to meet this line, with some laptops having 86WHr or 56WHr batteries.\n\nA commenter (Intrepid_Passage_692) on this thread and an obvious to me fellow enthusiast also pointed out some great things which I will share here in their own words. ---\"the difference between a 100 and 200 dollar laptop is insane. 400 is the next jump, then 800, then 1200. Laptops get AMAZING once you spend over 1200 bucks. Past 2k is the land of diminishing returns, at that point buy what you want.\" ---\n(USD assumed, 2k means 2,000USD, a buck is a slang term for a dollar.)---\n\"just get core ultra. They significantly outperform core chips up to ~80-100W. At that point, no one worrying about sub 2k laptops will even be able to afford a chassis that can contain a chip going over 100W without thermal throttling. I have to use a watercooled laptop to tame the 14900hx. I am looking forward to core ultra, even if it means I lose 20% performance at *checks notes* 210W...\"---\n(W means Watts. A laptop drawing 60 watts for an hour will draw 60Whr (Watt Hours) from a battery., 2k means 2,000USD, 14900hx is 14900HX, a 14th Gen Intel Core Processor that is Top of the line, thermal throttling is a term used to describe when your computer reaches its maximum temperature before it reaches its maximum performance, water-cooling is a form of laptop cooling that involves water. Works like a car engine cooling system, with cooling fluid being pumped from the engine to a radiator and back. I disagree with Intrepid the discarding of the Intel Core Series. I feel that if the differences were that high, I would hear more noise about it. I am currently and always looking into it.)\n\n\nFor anyone who made it this far, know that my prices are high bars with padding so that people who do the bare minimum of research can just go buy a laptop priced at $500 and actually get a decent device. (For consumers, if you read the last sentence and decided to take off $100USD from your budget based on that, I highly recommend you retract that decision). I myself got a used $600USD laptop for $350USD and I can do pretty much anything with it. The difference between experienced users and everyday consumers is that they don't know how to get great laptops at great prices. That is why this subreddit exists.\n\n\nFun facts that you can skip through:\n1. lithium ion batteries should be replaced every two years\n2. SSD's have a lifespan, this is measured in TBW (TeraBytes Written) it is unlikely you will reach the end of a SSD lifespan.\n3. Snapdragon Processors are found in mobile phones.\n4. Minecraft, especially Java Edition, is more CPU intensive than GPU intensive.\n5. When a SSD writes it's last byte, it tells the computer it cannot be written to anymore, this makes the computer angry. You can restore the data by simply reading it. Take it to a local repair shop. HDD require a much more expensive fix, as they have moving parts that have physically worn out.\n6. Data written on mediums such as CD's (Compact Disks), DVD's (Digital Video Disk's), HDD's, SSD's and more have a lifespan? Data can disappear over time. If you have a 20 year old CD with a song on it laying around, well you don't. \n7. Lenovo is actually in part owned by the PRC. However, the way it's business is structured and the fact they don't sell completely custom parts, means that even the United States government trusts Lenovo to provide them with Servers and server equipment.\n8. Snapdragon mobile processors are popular in high end phones. The new processors you find in laptops are tweaked so they consume more power and put out more performance, but they use the same architecture.\n9. In 2005, AMD's Athlon 64 FX-57 was overclocked to 10 GHz using liquid helium cooling. Breaking 10GHz was a significant achievement at the time, but it required extreme cooling conditions and was not a commercially available product.\n10. A CPU's GHz does not equal performance. Like other computer things, many variables are involved.\n\n\nI specifically did not mention AMD Ryzen because I do not know the AMD Ryzen naming scheme like I do Intel naming Scheme.\n\nFor fellow enthusiasts, if I get something wrong or leave something out, please leave a comment so I can address it, I will not be offended. \n\nI put lots of love into this guide, and I appreciate hearing back from you to find out if it helped, although you are under no obligation to do so. I do not do this for money.\n\nPersonally, as one may be curious to know, I recently decided to temporarily go broke and I got myself an ASUS ROG ALLY X.\n\nThank you for reading, if you feel the need, remember to stay posted as I update this guide very frequently. Next year this guide will be deprecated as I am planning on making a new and improved guide available next year.\n\nVery recently, have created a new Subreddit where I will create guides like this. It is very new. Go to r/TOOsTechTactics and you will find it. I have always wanted to do something like this, your feedback and time have given me the push to start.\n\nIf you have read to this point and would like to see the 2025 guide, basically this guide but updated, please go here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TOOsTechTactics/s/Qw88cYk4GQ\n\n-An experienced person who has made lots of mistakes and learned from them.",

  "Second post in this thread, first of all, great post!!\nTo get into Amd is not hard and very mich rewarding since they make very good laptop cpu's. Most people would even say, better then intel on the last 2-3 generations.\n\nAllow me to extend your post with this info:\n\n\nAmd ryzen laptop cpu:\n\nExample: Ryzen 7840HS:\n\nJust like intel the first number is the gen: in this case 7\n\nJust like intel has the i3, i5, i7 and i9 tier, Amd has Ryzen 3,5,7,9 tier.\nLook at the second number, here 8 means it's a ryzen 9 (higher then 7).\nthe 40 is subsequent tier number.\n\nThe suffix, here 'HS' indiquates the power/hear target. HS is the highest (for enthousiasts). Look online for other suffixes.\n\n\nThen current gen:\n\nJust like Intel (I feel a pattern here) AMD decided to screw the naming schemes and call their cpu's 'Ryzen AI 9 370' Which basically says it's Ai-ready, which only means they have NPU core, it's expressed in TOPS (google the acronym). The current tier is 360, 365, 370 and 375, I'm sure more will come. They first had an exclusivity contract with Asus, that's why most HX 3xx cpu-powered laptops are from asus but lenovo, hp and other brands are starting to offer them as well.\nThose new cpu's are very much focussed on efficiency, just like the new ultra intel cpu's, and good iGpu.",

  "I think 500$ laptops are not enough for roblox/minecraft games cuz, i got a \"gaming\" laptop with GTX 1650 ti and i5 10300h and it's not really good cuz sometimes it just freezes in games.

  "I could use some help. I am looking to buy a new pc, and i will need it to last me a few years, as i will use it for school and probably wont be able to afford a new one as a student. I will obviously be using it mostly for school, more specifically i will be majoring in law. So no crazy applications or tools will be needed. I dont really play video games too much, but will play the occasional civilizations 6 and 7 (when it comes out). Not the most demanding game and i dont mind having to lower the graphics a bit if i need to for it to run smoothly. Therefore im fairly certain that i wont need more than 256GB storage. \n\nI was also thinking 16GB RAM would be enough, but now im not sure. My only problem is that in my price range there arent a lot of computers available with more RAM from what i can see. I was looking at the Macbook 13” M3 16/256, just for the quality and battery life, but if there are better options with perhaps more RAM (if you think i’ll need it) i would love to know. I am from Denmark, so my prices might sound a little steep compared to what i can see on other forums. I can get the MacBook for 1200$, which might sound like a bad deal for people in the us, but everything is more expensive here so. \n\nPlease note that since im from Denmark most American websites like bestbuy or american amazon is either not useable or will come with some hefty taxes, so im not looking for specific deals, but more just a hint to certain models. I was also looking at the Lenovo Yoga 7i gen 9, but i dont think thats better unless i could get 32GB RAM for a similar price to the MacBook, but please let me know if it is.\n\nI dont know if i’ve just written a bunch of useless stuff, but i hope it gives an insight to my situation and needs, and i would be extremely happy if anyone would be willing to provide some insight",

  "Thank you for this post - it's very helpful!\nI wonder if you (or perhaps another reader on the thread) can comment about build quality (of course nothing is 100% for sure, but still!) and number of cores.\n\nSpecifically, I am looking at two computers:\n\n[Asus Vivobook S 14](https://www.walmart.com/ip/ASUS-Vivobook-S-14-14-WUXGA-OLED-PC-Laptop-Intel-Core-Ultra-7-32GB-RAM-1TB-SSD-Black-S5406/7447569796?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&sourceid=dsn_ad_67b24a3e-8de0-4c6a-a2eb-385363192ede&veh=dsn&wmlspartner=dsn_ad_67b24a3e-8de0-4c6a-a2eb-385363192ede&cn=FY25-Holiday-GIFT-PMax_con_dps_dsn_dis_ad_xcat_s_n&gclsrc=aw.ds&wl9=pla&wl11=online&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA3ZC6BhBaEiwAeqfvymZYDTNdBAzq54K-ePX6-NeGaIbigDYaKaqaltlRMcBxEQsD4hHEBhoCIiwQAvD_BwE)\n\n[Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 11](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx1/thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-11-14-inch-intel/21hm002fus)\n\nWith sales/coupons they end up a similar price (~1000 USD - I know the Lenovo defaults to showing more on that page, but member sales make it really cheap). On paper, the Vivobook's specs are a touch better (slightly newer processor, twice as much storage (terabyte vs. half), larger battery, OLED screen), and otherwise they're pretty much the same.\n\nMy main questions are:\na) do you have thoughts on the processor difference? (Intel Ultra 7 258V vs. Core i7-1365U vPro). Lots of benchmarking sites say that the ultra is performing better, but it also has several fewer cores and I just don't know if that will be an issue in the long run somehow? This is beyond my expertise.\n\nb) What's the catch with the Vivobook/which is a safer bet? The Vivobook is not supposed to be Asus's premium/flagship line, and yet it has amazing specs for very cheap, relatively. Are they known to fall apart? Hinge issues? Something weird? Is the Lenovo a safer bet given that it's from their flagship line? But also I've heard people say their battery life isn't great so maybe it's not?\n\n\n\nI know I can't have it all, but these seem very, very close to it: powerful machines that are nonetheless very light and portable.\nAt this moment they're maybe overkill for my needs - I'm a social sciences researcher so I do a lot of word processing, I make presentations, excel, sometimes R and other research programs, and mostly I often have a lot of programs open at the same time (think word, a reference manager, Spotify, excel, Teams or similar, and multiple browser tabs). I also occasionally watch shows/movies or do very light gaming (when I have time, which currently I don't), but these are much less critical for me. I prioritize performance over storage - I store the largest segments of my data off of my computer anyway.\nBut anyway, I like having computers for a long time and I'm hoping these will last.\n\n\nNo pressure to give feedback - I think I'm just torn between two very good options, and it's hard to go wrong (but also hard to choose)!",

  "Thanks for all the time you put into this! I'm looking for a new laptop because mine which I had for 4 and a half years just stopped working. I don't use it for work (have one for that) or gaming, mostly just watching shows on streaming services, YouTube, live sports, etc. and then general stuff like google docs and whatnot. Therefore I do not need anything specific on it, I just want one that will last. Do you have any brand recommendations and a minimum price recommendation for something like that?",
  "First things first, I appreciate the effort you gave to make this post. I agree with your reasoning too, teaching people how navigate computers is better than a random stranger spitballing recommendations online. If I bought a laptop someone recommended me and it underperformed, I’d be pissed. This atleast helps give people a scope to realize you have to shell out some cash for a decent laptop. I have a few criticisms/add ons though.\n\n1) I9 started being produced gen 8, not Gen 5. Doesn’t really matter other than there isn’t a single i3 (i5s push it) that’s better than the og i9-8950hk. (8 year old chip btw) \n\n2) ram should take precedent over cpu at this point. 8GB of ram makes my 14900hx perform like a 10th gen i5 with 32GB of ram. It literally dictates how long your computer will last. If you want to use it for more than 2 years, 16gb minimum. If you have a computer with 8gb of ram and it feel like things run slow or choppy, it’s the ram. \n\n3) If you intend on doing ANY gaming, you need a dgpu. 0 exemptions other than sims 4 and games pre 2014. Even Roblox/minecraft on integrated graphics is a terrible experience ESPECIALLY with 8gb of ram. \n\n4) your 3 paragraphs going in detail about the suffixes of intel chips can be condensed into one because 3/4th of it isn’t applicable anymore. If people are buying chromebooks from 2020 with 9250g’s in them they should’ve read the beginning of your post better. The only laptops with g or y chips are Chinese temu shitbooks\n\n5) the difference between a 100 and 200 dollar laptop is insane. 400 is the next jump, then 800, then 1200. Laptops get AMAZING once you spend over 1200 bucks. Past 2k is the land of diminishing returns, at that point buy what you want.\n\n6) just get core ultra. They significantly outperform core chips up to ~80-100W. At that point, no one worrying about sub 2k laptops will even be able to afford a chassis that can contain a chip going over 100W without thermal throttling. I have to use a watercooled laptop to tame the 14900hx. I am looking forward to core ultra, even if it means I lose 20% performance at *checks notes* 210W…\n\n7) I understand why you recommend userbenchmark but notebookcheck is infinitely better, just harder to navigate. If you want to do one better look up 3d mark or cpumark scores.",

  "Hi, thanks but I disagree with some things.  \n\nI have CDs over 20.  They still play flawlessly.  The data on a CD is expected to last 100 years.  Longer if you keep them from corrosion.  The data is not magnetic and does not rely upon an electrical charge.  Probably lack a player for playback before the disc goes bad.\n\nMy info says most cheap SSDs will last only 5 years or so before they fail.  Maybe longer depending on usage.  Depends on how much you fill it and how many deletes and rewrites you do.  We'll see in a few years I guess. \n\nCPU Ghz does mean performance.  That's why we have overclocking on CPUs and GPUs.   That's part of why a newer i5 can beat an older i7.  Computationally intensive apps like CAD and even Minecraft will benefit from high Ghz CPUs with great single core performance.  Intel CPUs tend to be better in this than AMD ones.\n\nUS Gov trusts all the spies been in it for decades.  Everywhere from Air Force recruits to US Commanders to US Congressmen like Menendez.  Who cares if they trust Lenova - I don't.  No HP, I don't recommend you either.\n\nLi batteries lose capacity over time but they vary and can still hold 80 percent up to 10 years or more.  Depends on usage.  My laptop is still using a 5 year old battery no problem.  It does not last as long, true.  Probably depends on charge/depletion cycles and the quality of the battery, etc.  They should be replaced when you aren't getting enough usage time anymore.  Hopefully car li batteries last more than 2 years... What happens to all these old batteries?  Where are they going?  Are they toxic?  Does anyone care?\n\nHere's my advice:  1. only buy windows 11 pc's now, 2. laptop ram is not upgradable so only buy one with 16 Gb plus now.  Resist the half priced 8 Gb ones if you work on your pc.  3. Opinions vary but I think Intel i7 14700 is still the best bang for the buck if you do CAD, MineCraft etc.  Leave the Core AI CPUs for later when there's actually some useful AI to bother with.  4. Don't let Windows 11 attempt to update your brand new PC's bios.  The AI and CoPilot are just too dumb to do much of anything correctly.\n\nI just returned my GF's new HP laptop.  Thanks Staples for making it easy.  The laptop was really nice with great look and feel to the hardware but Windows 11 tried to update the bios.  One Drive could not even find its own files and folders.  Anivirus not working warning right at first startup - no antivirus activated on brand new HP laptop - not even Windows Defender.  Popup ads galore every startup.  Do research online just to figure out how to disable all the ads popping up and literally filling the screen with ads.  So back it went.  Just as well, it only had 8 GB ram hard installed when MS recommends 16Gb for its Core CPUs. LoL\n\nGuess what HP and DELL are planning on?  Everyone in the entire world that is still on windows 10 is being forced to get a new PC before Oct 2025.  We're talking billions or even trillions of dollars.  Collusion?  Or just a case of when interests coincide?  LoL",

  "You are totally correct. I wondered on commenting that all Apple products are good products, and as far as build quality goes, they totally are. The one issue I had though was the lock into the ecosystem. It's an expensive ecosystem and also, buying replacement parts is a nightmare for Apple. For example, for an iPhone, you cannot buy a new battery, you must also buy a new screen, and that costs around $500USD.\n\nMacBooks are great for everyday use.\nOk for light gaming.\nA joke for heavy gaming.\nLaughable repairability. \n\nHowever, it's good to note that they are great for everyday use, which is what 95% of people will use it for.",

However, if you can buy your own RAM and put it in yourself for cheaper, do that. \n\n1TB SSD is great, but I mean, you have to justify using a whole 1TB if you know what I mean. \n\n3050 is a solid GPU. No it's not the best, but as an owner of one, it's a good pick. I can't choose for some reason the other cards. You don't need a 4090 unless overkill gaming, and you would need a Core i7 for that. Do note that the 50 series of NVIDIA graphics cards are coming out. Maybe a 40 series if you can afford it for that extra mile. \n\nLook up if it's repairable.\n\nI'm not a wizard.",

  "Look above. You find the laptop.\n\nIf you are doing professional work, you will probably need a dedicated GPU.\nIf it is light work, a modern CPU should do the trick.\n\nI have no clue what type of work you will be doing, so I can't exactly recommend a specific set of specs. That would turn into a confusing list quickly. You can suggest laptops, name the specs in a comment, and I can tell you if it is a decently spec'd laptop.\nI cannot foresee the future.\nI am not a wizard.",

  "Find a laptop that meets the minimum specs I have recommended. If you are doing video editing, I suggest a discreet GPU. At least 10th Gen i5 CPU if you don't want a discreet GPU. There are plenty out there.\n\nI can tell you if you are under buying or overbuying but you gotta find the laptop. I am not in your region and therefore do not know if it is on sale, etc etc.\n\nI suggest regular backups if you have an 8TB HDD.\nYou will not need a powerful machine to do simple file sorting. However, video editing, even putting your photos in an slideshow video doesn't require alot. However, the speed in which you can do so depends on your GPU, and if you do not have a discreet GPU, then your CPU. Your CPU has a mini GPU inside of it. However the difference between these two is your perspective on a light bulb and the sun in the sky.\n\nYou do not need a laptop with a 40 series NVIDIA GPU, although you would probably appreciate it, that is overkill. Even a 3050 is just fine. You can go even lower.\n\n\nSeeing as how you have a 4GB machine, I can guess it has an internal HDD. This is what makes your machine slow (this is an educated guess) any laptop you buy on the market these days should have an SSD. It stores slightly less data than a hard drive but achieves 40x 50x 100x 400x speeds than a hard drive does. You do not need 64GB of RAM to sort through files. I recommend 24GB or more to keep your laptop up to date for at least 2 years. 16GB is ok, but I don't recommend.\nI think any modern upgrade will probably be better than you already have.\nDo you want performance? Do you know how much you want to spend?\nI would rather you overpay for a laptop that works than a laptop that is inadequate.",
  "Ok my friend.\n\nSurface Pros are a nightmare to repair.\nI have heard the laptops are much easier.\nThe reason why this is significant is that in the case you break your laptop, and you take it into the repair shop, the poor guy who tries to help you because you needed it fixed by yesterday can actually fix it. You may not know, but parts are extremely hard to find, for a good price. \nExample, some MacBook pro models require you to buy a new screen when you want to purchase a new battery.\nBatteries should be replaced every two years, as per expert recommendation, as the capacity and health will decline over time. However, this screen battery combo is $600-$800USD, which is insane. And if you don't want to pay that, your only option is to buy aftermarket, and who knows what Chinese warehouse aftermarket is from. I've gotten good parts and bad parts from aftermarket. And then your computer repair guy takes the loss of its not a good part. Screen replacements can cost $100USD to $1000USD. No joke.\nHowever, I recommend at least 24GB of RAM for a laptop that you want to last 2+ years.\nSurface laptop is like buying a MacBook. It's a premium machine. You are paying extra for that premium that comes with the Surface brand name. Surface is directly owned by Microsoft, FYI.\nPost me a link for your SL7 and I can take a better look at it.\nIr you can find alternatives, I will be happy to advise you on whether or not the specs will last for 3 years or more.\nDo be aware I am not a future seeing wizard.\nDo be aware I cannot advise on durability, as of the millions of laptops out there, I have not used all of them for 5+ years.",

They vary so widely even within the brands, and I haven't used all 50 100 million laptops ever in production.\n\nAs long as the CPU is sufficient, I checked, equal to Intel Core i7-13700KF, you will be just and very fine. You may be going a little overboard on the CPU but it isn't overkill.",
  "As of current, an NPU (of what makes an AI chips so special) is (to my understanding) a bit of a marketing thing. They do have real use, but it's not anything your GPU cannot do. Industry is planning on having computers natively compute AI tasks, and that is what the NPU is for. Thing is that those chips are the absolute bare minimum, and the reason why is that we have no actual application made for them, yet.\n\nYou are probably going to want more RAM down the road, upgrade from 16GB.\n\nOption two will be ready for AI if it does come out, because it has a great 4050 GPU. I'd get option 2, it has great specs, and a dGPU. That's basically the biggest thing in its favor following with the i7-14th gen, of which is the best of the best designation with HX, which basically means it's really cool (it can overclock, for enthusiasts only)\nI cannot vouch for build quality, unfortunately. Omen is made by HP, so take that with it. Just take good care of it. Laptops are not indestructible, but it is infuriating that they don't make them better \n\nThis will handle his music tasks like a pro if he can keep it cool and keep it clean.",

  "Even if I did know a cheaper option, it probably would not be avaliable in your area.\n\nPeople hate on Intel. However, they are still the most popular brand out there. \nAssuming you are willing sacrifice performance for a little more battery life, getting a Core Ultra 7 or an Intel Core i7 should be ok.",
  "I did not click on the links.\n\nThe Ultra 7 (no 2).is going to have middle performance compared to no 4 highest of the bunch (excluding 1) And no 3's lowest performance.\n2,3,4 are great options, with the most powerful being 1,4,2,3. \n\nYou are going to love the OLED screens, especially when watching movies, 3,4\n\n16GB RAM on all of those is living on the edge. I would look and see if the RAM is soldered down, and if you can replace it later on. It's not an immediate issue. \n\n2,3,4 are all great computers with 1 being a little overkill.\nAs I said in my guide, the Intel Core Ultra will be more efficient (relatively)\nAnything else?",
  "You don't need an iGPU, you want a dGPU. Option 2 has a dGPU. An iGPU is an Integrated Graphics Processing Unit, which means the graphics lives inside of your CPU, it's a mini GPU that isn't sufficient for high end gaming. It's great because it's more efficient and good for basic tasks and light gaming. A dGPU is a Dedicated Graphics Processing Unit. It is it's own chip that is usually much more powerful than an iGPU. This is what you want for high end gaming or performance, it's not as efficient as having an iGPU, but much more powerful.",

  "Some people say that MacBook's don't need as much RAM as Windows, and I haven't seen any huge issues arise from this. 16GB RAM on Mac is just fine. MacOS is a different operating system from windows, it's built differently. What you gain with Mac is battery life, what you lose is performance and compatibility, however, for your use case it's just fine.\nSorry for not clarifying this, good luck m8.\n\nJust because your from different country doesn't mean I can't give you advice tailored to your situation. Know that I as an American respect you and your country.",
  "I can see a very wonderful block of HTML when I load the link.\nAssuming you game, you will have a GPU. Your GPU will be more than sufficient to do AI tasks.

Ultra 7, like an i6.25, and Ultra 5 like an i4.25.",
  "My man, I highly recommend against 8GB of RAM, unless you are comfortable with the performance hit, I strongly recommend against it. Times have changed and 8GB is simply not enough. Feel free to not take my recommendations, but do remember it will come at a cost. It's got a decent i5 12th Gen processor, and it's going to be powerful ish, but the fact that the i5 12th Gen you picked out is mobile, makes it more like a powerful i3 12th Gen. That's still fine with day to day browsing.",
  "Woah. Ok, I cannot recommend on the build quality of any specific computer. That would take hours of my day. Sorry m8.\n\nHowever, I can help with the H and U designation.\nA U processor has better battery life, but much less performance, relative to the chip. The H has more performance, and less battery life, relative to the chip. I'd say (this is a complete guess) a 30 min to 1 hour difference in battery life and 10-30 fram difference. Keep in mind this is a guess based on intuition! \n\nSeeing as how you wanted a laptop with an integrated CPU, I suggest getting a CPU. ;D any laptop with an i5 or Intel Core Ultra has a CPU!\nWhat you will want is to have an H processor with a graphics card like an RTX 3050 like you mentioned for gaming. Have a U processor for a laptop that you take around for school and stuff, if that is what you wanted.",
  "Was it the starting at machine?\n\nFor a Windows machine, 8GB is horrendous. For a Mac, you need about 25% less RAM. Id go with a 16GB model if possible.\nYou won't be able to do any gaming or high demand applications with any Mac, but you get great battery life and the Apple Ecosystem.",
  "It's ok to post here, I think it's cool I am reaching people from all over the world! I could not reach the link, if you look up how DNS servers work, you can learn why. \nThat will absolutely meet your needs, it will be just fine.

The darks are very dark, you'd just have to see it compared to a backlit display (LED, IPS, LCD)\nIntel Arc Graphics are by no means bad. Intel is making Arc as a direct competitor to NVIDIA and AMD. They have done a really great job even I applaud them. That card will only get better, it is good enough now to suit your needs. If that sounds good to you, I'd go with the Asus Zenbook 14 with the Arc Graphics and Intel Core Ultra 7.\nZenbook pro 14 is a big no. I have no clue why they would build such a beast with an i9 processor and 16GB of RAM, overkill processor, inadequate RAM.\n60Hz refers to the amount of times your display will refresh, like the Frames Per Second in movies or Games. You don't need higher unless you are high end gamer, although these displays with high refresh rates tend to have smoother look and feel, incrementally. You don't need it, is what I am trying to say. 60Hz is just fine.\nFor CAD, the CPU does 60% of the work. Intel Core Ultra 7 will handle it fine.",
  "1, no, it has 8GB RAM. 2 for the same, 3 same reason, but 16GB of RAM, and 4 is also 16GB of RAM. Don't expect any of these to last 4 years simply on the Basis of too little RAM. Aim for 24GB or more.\nThe other specs look good, RAM is the one issue.\nIn other words you could have the exact same machine work, I would recommend the exact same machine if they met the 24GB RAM recommendation.",
  "It's not that much of a difference, thinking relative to your needs now. It's a significant performance difference, but I cannot find a good reason to justify the $40. Acer laptop also seems to be the better deal because of the 1TB SSD and the better battery. However, for web browsing, the size SSD is not a major problem. If you want a laptop that will last anywhere from a little more to maybe extend the life by a year, go for it. It's up to you. \nThe RAM will likely be the biggest determining factor in the lifetime of the laptop. Make sure to consider of the RAM is soldered on either before making a final decision, as of it is soldered, it basically eliminates life support for your laptop.",

Today, an OLED screen is one of the most beautiful screens you can get, beautiful coming from experts and not me. The darks are true dark so the contrast is great. 11.5 hours of battery is a lie, I will add that to my list. realistically about 4-6 hours. It should be fine, just make sure he carries a charger, and 6 hours isn't even bad. Batteries just don't last that long. They test that figure with \"optimal\" conditions, which is usually turning brightness all the way down, turning on power saving and playing a 720p mp3 video. \nIntel Arc Graphics are higher end than Iris, from what I gain. \nIntegrated Arc is just the graphics included in your CPU, CPU:s usually have a mini GPU for display when you don't have a dGPU.",

  "I think you should upgrade the RAM for it if you would like to keep it for more than 2 years. It will be great for video editing and Gaming as it has an RTX 4060 inside of it. I can not tell you whether something is a good deal. Prices can vary by region and simple whim, and it is hard to keep track of all that. I would suggest comparing it to similar spec'd items to consider whether it is a good deal.",
  "First thing, 16GB RAM is not overkill, it is too little when the laptop is expected to last two years. you should have at least 24GB of RAM to future proof it. This is especially important considering the amount of screens.\n\nYou need to make sure your computer will support that amount of screens, not just the processor. Some computers are limited to two monitors or three, make sure to check.\n\nFor day trading, I recommend having a laptop with an Ethernet port attached. This model does not seem to have one, but you can buy an Ethernet to USB adapter. Ethernet eliminates Wi-Fi instability. I made a segment in my guide.\n\nI would not be surprised if they made a little change to the price like that, just to get you to buy it. I cannot recommend a fair price, as it varies by region and whim.",

I would suggest specifically looking if your program is supported if you are looking into buying.

  "I suggest a laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor with an H designation. If you want to do some medium gaming, I suggest at least 32GB of RAM to boost performance as the iGPU in the processor isn't a dGPU, in other words, it's not super powerful. At least 512GB of SSD storage.\n\nThe higher resolution the lower performance you will get.\n\nThis should have pretty good battery life, and be fairly light as it does not have a dGPU. \n\nIt should be performant but don't expect high settings, maybe medium low.\n\nFor games like Roblox, highest settings. Minecraft Java should be a breeze. War Thunder on full medium or even high. I'm confident it can handle low-medium settings at 60FPS.\n\nI don't have a huge suite of games that I play so that's about the extent of my knowledge.\n\nSpeakers are always a hit or miss.

The reason why is that of the millions of laptops out there, I cannot vouch for a specific brand that has great build quality. The reality is that all brands out there have great laptops and horrible ones.\n\nIf you want reliability and speed, on the temperature end of things, I recommend buying a laptop accessory, that being a laptop cooling pad.

A smaller laptop is less likely to implode if it is dropped, but the hinges may be made out of a less durable material.\n\nAs for your 550 dollar budget, it really depends on your use case. Say you found one with a 12th Gen i3 and 24GB of RAM. You will probably be fine for most tasks for many years. A Celeron with 4GB of RAM is absolutely unacceptable.

  "Hi, I liked your write-up and some good info btw.  As for online info, a lot of variation depending on usage and experiences is what you find.  A lot of people repeat what they read but have no actual experience.  I do sometimes but usually only after I verify with sources I trust.  My laptop is a Dell Latitude with i7, 12Gb, SSD and is too slow for gaming and too small a display for CAD so I use mostly for going online, office apps and 3D print slicer apps.  I can't afford to game on a laptop.  I have a home built desktop, i7 CPU but more ram and GTX video I use for CAD and some Steam games.  I used to use only AMD because it was my preference, maybe due to pricing, but I do CAD probably more than gaming so I look for high ghz single core performance and that's usually intel.  \n\nIMO for gaming you can't beat a console.  Xbox or Playstation - at $500 its a steal compared with building a gaming PC and keeping it updated every couple of years so you can keep playing the current titles.  Let's see, should I spend $350 on a new CPU, $200 on a new board, $500 on a new video card and $70 on some more RAM and make due with my SSD for now or maybe get a Series X 1TB no-disc version for $399 plus $60 a year?

I'm considering taking the risk on a Nimo cyber monday deal (that's the brand that the other commenter linked above).  The 16 ram and 1tb is on sale for $299 and the same specs but 32 ram is on sale for $379.  In your opinion, is it worth spending the extra $80 on the extra 16 of ram?  Sorry if I'm using the wrong lingo, hopefully you get the gist.\n\nSecond question that is a bit off topic, but you seem to REALLY know your stuff and I'm so impressed.  What do you recommend for data hoarders to use to back up their data?  My refurbished pc began to fail last week at the worst possible time and I realized I hadn't backed anything up in about two months.   Do you recommend any particular program?

There is a recommended method for data backup, but I am not going to type that out. I recommend getting two external HDD if whatever size, maybe 2TB or 1TB (TB is TeraByte, 1,000GB or 1,024GB (windows makes this weird, it's why your drives may seem smaller than advertised, not going to explain it)) those two HDD should have the exact same stuff on them, if one fails which HDD's do, mechanical spinning disks, you will have time to buy and receive a new one and not lose any data. I personally backup to two separate HDD, one is bigger so one has more data, but all the same data, and then I also have various external drives that I use to keep single use data, for archival purposes. Cannot lose all those books.  HDD failure is a fact of life but if you buy a decent HDD (I buy Seagate ones) then treat it like it can happen but not likely to. Be aware but not afraid.\nI have a 500GB Samsung T7 which I love because it's aluminum chassis and I think cost me a out $30USD, I could be wrong. SSD is more expensive per GB of data but it will take a VERY long time to wear away especially if you write around a TB a month. Also when SSD fail unless it's on fire, you can still get data off of it you just can't put it on. No writing, only reading. Makes it basically fail proof. Never store data for more than 5 years, it can fade away. Make sure plug it in leave it there every year or so, something like that. \n\nMy eyes burning so no fixing red lines\n\nNo problem, I love helping you guys out.\nI want to acknowledge all the guys in my field who make a living off of their passion. it's not easy. People are not accommodating and are frankly rude and disrespectful. I hate seeing computer shop owners so jaded, because it tells of the abuse they have suffered. It's getting harder to repair, it's getting harder to find parts, and companies are going out of their way to make an extra buck just so you throw your device away after a year or two. I even found it a bit exasperating having 32 notifications once just trying to eat my dinner (wasn't that much  of a dinner, I burned my eggs). It can be frustrating. On top of that some Redditers got angry over the fact that I made a guide in the first place. Comments of appreciation like yours are so helpful, and make me want to do this and better next year. Thank you.",

  "Yes, upgrading RAM is something that you can do, but requires know how and a not smooth brain. Gotta be familiar and comfortable with screwdrivers. Essentially painting a very delicate picture. You need to check and see if the RAM is soldered and or upgradable for your specific model, and companies now will solder their RAM which essentially means \"SCREW YOU\" to the consumer and they get your money, again, when you replace your disposable device. \n\nI cannot recommend any specific laptops or brands, as 1 I have not tried them all and this cannot feel comfortable recommending, 2 I can only vouch for specs, 3 prices may differ from region to region.",

Samsung A series is a really good line of phones that were created to be on a budget. \n\nMotorola is owned by Lenovo. I personally own the Moto G Power 5G 2024. I didn't choose the phone, because I am not in a financial position to choose. It's camera is terrible and it's a little slow, but it will last 3 days or more without a charge and a full day with regular use. Battery life is great. If you prioritize battery, those are a decent line to look at.\n\nAnd yeah, HP laptops are generally considered to be horrible laptops, at least on the consumer end of things. Business class laptops are the laptops to get if you can. Businesses buy them, and make contracts to buy them, so they want the best.",

  "The Dell has a powerful processor with a dedicated graphics card. You should be able to play on medium settings (never played valorant.)\nIt will use more power, but will be very powerful.\n\nThe second option will be great for keeping battery life.

A WHr (Watt Hour) is a measurement of how much power a battery can hold  for example, if you have an 80WHr battery, given the battery is in perfect health, you can use your device to draw 80 watts for an hour. 40 for two. 20 for four, ten for 8, you get the picture.\n\nGL M8.",

However, if you lose access to your computer, or it breaks, those files will be permanently lost unless you have the decryption key. Not even the government will be able to decrypt your drive effectively without the key. I suggest turning off BitLocker unless you have sensitive documents. That way you can retrieve them if something goes wrong.",

I do notice a design flow though: The exhausts of the fans are toward the back of the laptop, but if you open the laptop with the screen at more than 95-100° angle, part of the screen is blocking the exhaust. There is 1 nice curve to counter that but it doesn't fully let the exhaust open, some air blows onto the screen due to this.\nIt is also getting quite hot during the update process, as I saw on the zenbook reviews (way more reviews on that one then the cheaper Vivobook S16 with this specific cpu).\n\nI have an asus motherboard in my desktop and their thermal pads are crap, so at some point I will probably repoace the pads and paste with upsiren putty and ptm 7950, I hope this will help get less hot, we'll see.",

I just leave my computers on for a few hours connected to Wi-Fi and they do their thing, occasionally restarting and restarting when prompted.\n\nI make sure to install updates from windows and Microsoft store, also any optional updates.",

  "This is a Core Ultra 9. You will love the windows hello feature, basically takes a 3D image of you so it is more secure than your phone (I wonder why...). 32GB of RAM, love to see it!\n\nCan't speak for build quality, but the specs meet.",
  "Option 7. You will need that dedicated GPU for that blender power, assuming you do high quality work.\n\n\nIt also has 24GB of RAM. Spot on!",
  "Np feel free to ask for anything regarding specs.",
  "I know this isn't the answer that you would like to hear, but the best way to ensure that you move all of your data is to manually move it. I would look into purchasing an external SSD. Depending on the size of your drive in your old computer, you will purchase this drive. I personally use a Samsung T7 drive and it works very well. Crucial is another good brand. Get an external SSD from a reputable brand.\n\nManually COPY all of your important files to the SSD and then manually COPY them back into place. \n\nThis also means that you have an extra drive that has all of your important data. \n\nThis is my recommendation.",
  "Ever since you mentioned about the RAM I'm definitely looking for a 32gb spec laptop now! Not many around that are within my budget unfortunately but this definitely would be. Would be £750 with my company perks discounts \n\nHave come across a review which I think is the same device (the more im researching, the more im discovering just how confusing the market really is - again, just like you mentioned!) but really can't be certain",
  "ok thank you, if i weren’t to use blender, because if i were, it would be more for very simple projects, what would be the next best option?",
  "Ok, can you give me your opinion on this one? Kinda looks like a scam in some way https://www.amazon.com/Naclud-Computers-Quad-Core-Portable-Notebook/dp/B0DK5R79LM?ref=dlx_cyber_dg_dcl_B0DK5R79LM_mw_sl7_79",
  "I have a my passport external drive. Will look at Samsung T7. ",
  "If you buy 16GB you help out the sellers because you will need to come back and buy a new one.",
  "Option 1, as it has at least 24GB of RAM.",
  "Nope. Stay away. That also is a terrible computer. 4GB RAM and 128GB eMMC. eMMC is basically a SD card. Slower than a HDD. Don't buy.\nAlso a Celeron processor.",
  "A Hard drive will work as well, as long as it is reliable and has the capacity that you need.",
  "Legion Slim 5 Gen 9 (16\" AMD) is a good choice? With the arrive of summer my dell g5 that is now 5-6years old decided to abandon me, therefore I started looking for a good substitute.\n\nAfter some research I decided that this time I would try the legion family of the lenovo, since I saw that in the last few years theyre product where always welcomed with great feedback! My budget is of about 1500€ so I opted for the legion slim 5.\n\nThe build that I'm looking at is:\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS\n* GPU: RTX 4060\n* Ram: 32gb (16x2) 5.600Mhz\n* SSD: 512 GB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 TLC ( i will upgrade it with the 1T samsung 990 pro that i own)\n* Screen: 16\" WQXGA (2.560 x 1.600), IPS, antiriflesso, non-touch, sRGB 100%, 350 nit, 165 Hz\n* OS: I'm choosing to install the os by myself so I got 100€ less from the price\n\n**The price would be of 1400€** (without warranty), is it a good price for these specs or should i wait next month since maybe the price will go down with the release of the new ryzen AI 300 series laptop?\n\nUntil the end of june it is on sale so I dont know how much it could benefit from it, in fact it will be most probably more expensive.\n\n**I wouldly gladly accept any information and opinion about this product**, be it real experience or just information you know from being more knowleable of this field.\n\nAnother question is for the OS, I already installed windows in many pc and did some clean installation, installing it on a new laptop is something different from a clean installation and i need to research something, or is it just installing the os and then activating it with a key?\n\nThanks in advance for the reply.",
  "Is it really worth it to spend an extra 200$ for the ryzen 7 7000 series for a med-high gaming experience on the legion 5 laptop? ",
  "Depends, what else does it chanage on it?  If it includes a better screen, more ram, AND the Ryzen 7, yeah, definitely worth it.",
  "is the Notebook Lenovo Legion 5 worth it to buy? so somebody suggested me this laptop and i wanna know if it's worth it since i'm not the best at knowing this stuff i plan to be using it for, a lot of gaming, 3d modelling and rendering, 3d and maybe 2d animation, voice acting, music production, graphic design, video editing\n\nthis is the link to the exact product i was looking at:  \n[https://www.lenovo.com/us/outletus/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-5-series/legion-5i-gen-7-(15-inch-intel)/82rb004vus?orgRef=https%3A%2F%2F](https://www.lenovo.com/us/outletus/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-5-series/legion-5i-gen-7-(15-inch-intel)/82rb004vus?orgRef=https%3A%2F%2F)",
  "Seeking Advice on Legion Pro 5 16\" for After Effects and gaming  Hi everyone,\n\nI'm currently in the market for a new laptop and, after some research, my attention was captured by the Legion Pro 5 16\" model, the version with the Ryzen 7 processor, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, and an RTX 4070 GPU. From what I've read, it seems to receive good reviews for its performance and price (1699 EUR). My primary use case would be running After Effects very smoothly without a long rendering process and I'd like to indulge in some gaming. I'm not into the latest, most demanding titles, but I do enjoy a wide range of games that aren't too graphically intensive.  Anyway, I'm a bit out of my depth with laptop specs so if there are alternative laptops you think could be better, I'm all ears. ",
  "Lenovo Legion 5 for about 1210 dollars. Should I buy it ? I am very confused on what will be the best value for money. I want to be able to do coding , development , machine learning , editing maybe , game dev , some gaming as well. I have checked so many reviews for so many laptops it is confusing.",
