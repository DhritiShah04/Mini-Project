  "How is lenovo Ideapad slim 5 Ryzen 7 7735HS. If anyone have this laptop i really wanna know the reviews. Nd battery too.",
  "FIrst and foremost doubt. Why is the title and description says 7735HS and the options below says 7735U?\n\nBoth of them are good performers. If we go to specifics, both have same cores and threads, 95% details are same between those twooo.\n\nThe only difference is:\n\n* **7735HS** is 15% better in multi-core performance than 7735U. HS is 15% better in performance than U.\n* **7735U** has better performance per watt, meaning slightly higher battery power than 7735HS. U has better efficency than HS (maybe like 10mins more depending on the usage).\n\nMake sure you are getting the model that you are looking for. The seller might have done the incorrect information, but just to make sure you are getting the same contact with them and confirm once. Just a precautionary.\n\n**Disclaimer:**¬†These are rough calculations.",
  "I prefer to buy from lenovo official website , you get a 3000‚Çπ off on a offer called after10deal it applys after 10 pm and if you use credit card 3000‚Çπ off further,  finally it will be around 56,000‚Çπ\n\nIt has a 70Whr battery 100% SRGB display and its 15 inch version  \n\n\nhttps://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-s-series/lenovo-ideapad-slim-5-gen-10-15-inch-amd/83j3003sin",
  "Yes I know this much about it. I'm asking if this is a good option or not?",
  "Fine but I don't want soldered ram does it come in SoDIMM?",
  "Yes yes, OP. Its really a good laptop and your choice.\n\nBattery Life of **Ideapad 8-11Hrs** as per various sources, thats an average. Some even got 12hrs with single charge.\n\nIf you dont mind me saying this, I have the same brand and processor in my notepad list and its only 56K from direct Lenovo site.

  "whats your usecase?",
  "The thinkbook u mentioned ppl say it will come max 4hr battery life is it true or false info",
  "Coding, little gaming and vdo editing. \nI'm a cs major student",
  "I promise you, when I first saw this laptop model 5 months ago. Its have very good battery and overall quality. Then, after 2 months I am seeing build quality is not good and its between Ideapad & ThinkPad quality.\n\nBut, seeing its battery capacity as 45Wh, no wonder it has low battery backup. I feel bad now for sharing that shit piece.\n\nFor that 54k price, you can get the ThinkPad though with a bit less performance processor and good build quality as most of them knowns that ThinkPads are build like tanks.\n\n**16\" | 7535HS | 16GB DDR5 | 512GB 2242 SSD | 45%NTSC, 300 nits, 60 Hz | PassMark: 17929**\n\n* ThinkPad E14 (21M3S0FJ00): [Lenovo ThinkPad](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e14-gen-6-14-inch-amd/21m3s0fj00) (‚Çπ55,870)\n* Gaming Test: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QL41ovz6hc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QL41ovz6hc)\n\nI hope atleast this one will have a good battery life. I checked the battery reviews from couple of websites and some mentioned it has good battery life and only a couple of people reported defective batteries.",
  "if theyre light games, then yes it is all good",
  "But this also has just 47wh \nI saw this https://share.google/4MdWRKCVp33Zjj2Na\n\nWhich 70wh it goes to 57k sometimes  but I searched everywhere but no review on this specific laptop",
  "I mean gta v for short time",
  "Can I use it for light 2d works? Not heavy ones",
  "So, I was scrolling randomly and saw someone asked for the same thinkbook review. One of the commenters mentioned it was shit...\n\nThey said this: The camera is really bad. Everything else seems to work fine. The battery is small though. 45Wh only (I get around 3.5 - 4hrs of battery under light usage). You can try for IdeaPad slim 3 with r7 8840HS. It has a 60Wh battery. Or IdeaPad slim 5 gen 10 with ai 7 350. The processor and battery combination in this one is deadly (and so is the price). 55k\n\nI think this would help you in picking up a good battery life laptop hopefully.",
  "yes, it should be sufficient",
  "Thank you",
  "Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3i- Core i7-13620H I didn't see much reviews of it(especially the i7 version),so thought I'll just a leave a review.(I've been using it for 14 days). I got the 16/512 variant for around 2500 SAR (670 USD,around 56000 INR, although it was at 63-65 when I checked Flipkart), although might be a different price in some other country.\n\nBuild Quality - A sturdy plastic build,but I felt kinda unimpressed with it (probably cause I came from a Huawei Matebook,which had a all metal build),but nevertheless for this price I'm not complaining much\n\nScreen- The anti glare coating is really helpful,and it does remove a lot of the glare on screen,and what else it's your regular IPS 1080p LCD panel. Pretty average,60 Hz,but it gets the work done.\n\nKeyboard - It comes with a full size keyboard ( with a number pad),and for me,keys felt a bit congested,I was just constantly pressing the wrong key( or I might have just big hands lol),but once you get around that the keyboard feels really solid.\n\nPerformance- Fantastic performance, for office works ,notes, school or college stuff,(I wrote some exams in this too), integrated graphics so not much gaming possible ,but I did get around 180 fps in valorant, although I mostly limit it to 65 fps to be easy on the CPU and so it doesn't overheat. You should be able to do some light gaming with no problems.\n\nBattery - I mostly have my charger around so I don't have much concern about the battery. For an H series CPU I'm not complaining about battery. When I do just basic tasks ,I always set it to battery saver ,and it does last me around 6-6.5 hrs\n\nSome Nice to haves- This one came with a fingerprint reader, feels pretty snappy.",
  "Thanks I finally saw a review! So how is it now? Are there any issues?   I‚Äôm planning to buy it tomorrow , it‚Äôll be my first laptop. I‚Äôll use it for my school, programming (lots of multitasking) and light gaming ( Roblox only)\n\n I honestly don‚Äôt know much about laptops, but the fan shouldn‚Äôt be too loud, right? I saw a comment saying the fan runs loud‚Äîdo you think it‚Äôs really noisy, or only when gaming? \nThe model btw is slim 3i 15irh8, tho there is another model which is slim 3 15irh8 with same specs but higher price, which idk what the difference is..",
  "Hi, I just ordered this one from Amazon for 550 USD but was not able to find much reviews except yours. How is it going for you till now?¬†",
  "Thanks for the review, I couldn't find any solid review about this specific laptop",
  "You should do a long term review of this laptop.\nI am also planning to buy one. Is it the best in this price range or should I buy another one?",
  "[deleted]",
  "Hi bro,Is it possible to do light gaming like valorant,I know you said 180 fps,but what about right now,long term is it fine?",
  "Is it good for a student in computer college?",
  "Can we do editing on it and play gta 5 bro ? Pls test gta 5 once üôè",
  "Hi, I‚Äôm interested in buying this laptop, but I‚Äôm concerned about whether it feels cheap due to the plastic materials. The processor and RAM seem excellent for the price, so I‚Äôm wondering if they might have compromised on something else to keep the cost low?",
  "Can I play games like rdr 2,far cry 6,etc. At least with low settings. \nShould I buy a graphics card. \nFirst of all can I insert a graphics card in it",
  "Hi, can we upgrade the RAM to 32/64GB for this laptop?",
  "I have the exact same computer with the exact same chip and same RAM size and I could say that your review is accurate. Just one thing but I also have it brand new (1 month) but I'm seeing that my battery is dying faster than usual. But still what a nice coincidence!",
  "Ideapads' body being plastic, have u experience any issues with its hinges? Overheating issues? Trackpad? Pls do answer, I'm planning to buy ideapad slim 3 myself, thank u",
  "Thanks a lot for your review\n\nI am considering to buy this laptop\n\nDo you still recommend it ?\n\nI am comparing it with \nDELL LATITUDE 5450 INTEL CORE ULTRA 5 512GB SSD 8GB RAM INTEGRATED INTEL GRAPHICS 14\" INCH FHD - GRAY\n\nWhich have an Ethernet port (which is important for me)\n\n\nAre you using a dock station with your IdeaPad slim 3 ?",
  "Que ha sido lo m√°s pesado que has hecho con ella sin considerar cosas que impliquen gpu como juegos.. Pura cpu.. Es que quiero ver si me sirve para producci√≥n musical semiprofesional",
  "Hey what about the hinge? Are they like typical \"lenovo hinge\"? Hows it holding up? And is your model is IdeaPad Slim 3 15IRH8 ? Do lemme know",
  "Its still holding up pretty well for me, everything feels like a breeze, besides the issues i've mentioned,(as a reply to another comment in this post), nothing much. If your tasks are CPU intensive, then yeah it should be pretty fine, it does pretty well for me.\n\nYeah, my unit's fans only run loud when gaming, although some other people did experience their fans running loud all the time. I'm not sure.\n\nIn my region, these are actually the same model.( idk why the different names)",
  "Hey, hows the laptop holding up now?",
  "hi it's still going pretty solid for me, battery lasts for like 5-6 hrs(YouTube and getting some studies done), performance is still good,the fan sometimes starts spinning even if I'm not doing much intensive tasks (prolly cause I set it to intelligent cooling mode)",
  "Some minor issues I would say would be:\n\n1. The trackpad sometimes ghosts a bit( i.e it feels like the cursor is catching up to you, rather than moving instantly),but it only lasts for like a min. and also I mostly use an external mouse ,so personally i didn't feel it to be much of an issue.\n\n2. The laptop crashes rarely when I play valorant on it, although i think its more of a vanguard anti cheat problem rather than the device problem.\n\nBesides these problems, so far this laptop is holding up well.\n\nIs it the best in this price range? Depends on your needs. You could get laptops with a better display, but the CPU mostly will be from the Intel or Ryzen U series, or you can get a Matebook which has an all metal premium build, but it comes with the core i5 rather than core i7.",
  "Did you buy it?",
  "Yeah,same case for me too. But when I set it in battery saver or run it on charge it's quiet so I think it's a software thing",
  "Yes, so far it's running pretty smooth for me,but like I said,I limit it to 60 FPS coz it's a 60 Hz screen,and it goes pretty easy on the CPU. I still get around that 165-180 FPS range.",
  "I really don't know,coz I never used it for those.",
  "I don't have GTA 5 bro(but some people tested the i5 version of this laptop and ran gta 5,it ran smoothly in low-med settings)..its good for editing works...",
  "For me its holding up really good, the build feels very sturdy. I think Lenovo cheaped out on the materials to keep the cost low",
  "If you are focusing in gaming, then I won't suggest this laptop. I never tried it for RDR 2,FC 6(If i remember correctly,you need to lots of graphics tweaks to get a decent experience). You cant install a GPU. You should be able to get better alternatives than this laptop, especially during sale.",
  "Hello, If i remember correctly you can't upgrade the ram as its soldered on.",
  "Well it's been quite a while since I'm using it,and I did notice quite a dip in battery,but also I only to charge it to 80 percent so there's that..",
  "so far, no issues with hinges, still going strong,no overheating issues too. Trackpad has that random ghosting feeling but doesnt occur much.",
  "Hello, I currently don't use a dock station,and your model I think has the U series processor,so I'm assuming you want really good battery life,so for that I would suggest go for the Dell. (also it would really help to get the 16 GB ram version,or upgrade it to 16 GB in the future, because of much ram windows consumes while idle)",
  "besides gaming, nothing that much demanding on cpu.",
  "The hinge is holding up well for me,so far no issues with it..Yes it's the 15IRH8 model.",
  "Hello,the laptop is still holding up well for me,running like the same it was from day one,lost a bit of battery (95 percent battery health when I checked in the lenovo vantage software),besides that still very smooth and fast.",
  "Is it good for reading charts with multiple tabs open?",
  "So would you recommend it for my engineering studies.\nI have to do coding little graphics related things and watch content?",
  "Not yet.\nI am still confused about what to buy\nShould I buy a gaming or a professional",
  "[deleted]",
  "Ok bro thnx",
  "I'm kinda late, but I'm also seeing quite a performance dip (possibly a bottleneck) compared to what has been 1-2 months ago, so i might consider getting a macbook soon, and this computer will probably be like a spare",
  "I honestly don't care about the battery life\n\nMy laptop is plugged in most of the time and i use an external monitor so it doesn't matter to me\n\nThe reason i chose dell is for the build quality and the Ethernet port\n\nBut i think the Lenovo IdeaPad slim 3 would be faster\nI am just concerned about the durability\n\nAfter 5 years, will the IdeaPad slim 3 hold up or fall apart",
  "Great, thanks!",
  "hey, im planning to get one this week, the 14\" model, performance seems impressive, but i wanted to know hows the hinge and thermal management? aswell as battery",
  "I'm assuming it's a CPU/ram intensive task,in that case yeah should be able to do it fine..",
  "For watching content, yeah it should be fine\n\nFor graphics and coding, I don't know cause I never used it for those.",
  "Did you buy?",
  "I was also thinking of buying this laptop but is it really that loud?\nI think I'll do some typing works only and I have to do some research too so I will be opening multiple tabs in browser might also do some light gaming. What do you think should I buy it?",
  "Oh, for me,so far,I've had no issues with the build quality,it has been going very strong for me,if you do the occasional maintenance,(say cleaning the fans and vents),the ideapad will last very well.",
  "The hinges and thermal management as well is still holding up strong..the battery I noticed there was a slight dip ( lost 5 percent of it's capacity and it's been a year now,so it's pretty normal), besides that going really good for me",
  "For your uses, then yeah its a good pick, but you can find better alternatives, especially during Christmas . My unit's fans only run really loud when i play games.",
  "So you open the back and do that cleaning every now and then?",
  "Nah,I just bring it by a store,and let them clean it,maybe like every 6 months",
  "Ah ok\n\nThanks a lot Man, i guess i will be going for it",
  "Lenovo Ideapad slim 3 gen 10 AMD 14\" So i bought this laptop for ¬£469 in the UK for university and i have had it for about a week now and I have not seen any reviews so i thought i would leave a review. It has a ryzen 5 8640hs with integrated radeon graphics, 16gb ram dual channel and a 60wh battery\n\nBuild quality: This laptop is made of sturdy plastic, the finish feels very nice but it is nothing to boast about, it is good enough for the price. I like how it is very lightweight and is really easy to carry around.\n\nDisplay: The anti-glare coating is great for this and really helps when it is sunny outside and the sun is very bright. 1920x1200 is very sharp but other than that its a regular 60hz IPS panel but it definitely gets the job done.\n\nKeyboard: This one does not come with a full size keyboard but I am not too bothered by this personally as I dont usually use the rest of the other keys. Sometimes I do press the wrong keys but once you get used to it, its a solid keyboard.\n\nPerformance: The CPU in this is very fast, whatever I do happens in an instant whether im video editing, watching videos, playing games or in a meeting. The 16gb ram also plays a huge role in this. What surprised me the most was the performance of the GPU considering its only 15W. I dont play very heavy games but this GPU was able to run forza horizon 4, fortnite, GTA, battlefield 1 and hollow Knight at good fps(these are the games I usually play). I also did some wii u emulation and it was flawless. One thing I will mention is that the laptop can be quite noisy when gaming on extreme performance mode but is very quiet when not being pushed.\n\nBattery: The battery on this is great for what it is. I was able to achieve around 7-8 hours from 100 percent to 20 whilst just doing my assignments(on battery saver). I got around 5-6 hours on netflix. When gaming the max i got was around 3 hours of battery life which is not too bad.",
  "wow thanks for this review! I was thinking of getting this laptops but couldn't find a lot of reviews so thanks <3",
  "Nice review, I just bought the version with AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS with dual RAM of 8 GB each. I hope I don't regret it, but the price of ‚Ç¨630 seemed very advantageous to me honestly",
  "How good an idea is it to get this same version but with 24GB of RAM for $800? Considering that I live in Chile and our prices tend to be higher than those in first-world countries.",
  "Hi! Thanks for the review. Do you think it's worth getting the Ryzen 78840HS version for 40‚Ç¨ more?? I'm gonna be using it for university work. Music production software and other music related software and some gaming",
  "Hi, I am interested of this Laptop, i.e. the 8840HS variant, supports DP alt mode 1.4 on the USB-C port.",
  "I know it's an old post but how is the laptop holding up so far ?",
  "Hi I‚Äôve had this laptop for over a month now and it‚Äôs been pretty good thus far but have a few issues/concerns and wanted to see if others are having! 1. The trackpad is not good my fingers dont move on it well and it doesn‚Äôt feel sturdy it feels pretty cheap. 2. I might of banged it at some stage but I noticed with the display when it shows black things the pixels are blue in a certain spot only a little you can barely notice it but it bothers me.",
  "No problem its a great laptop for its price, still going strong right now",
  "How is the battery?",
  "As far as I'm aware the \"24GB\" version doesn't exist, it can just support up to 24GB, as in you need to buy extra memory and install it yourself. If that's 800USD that's a disgusting price. Are Apple products also more expensive there? Personally I'd be looking into an Air M4 for that price.",
  "Dont get it, its not worth it at that price point",
  "Absolutely, that ryzen 7 is quite a bit faster and will be better for running multiple tasks, the igpu on it is slightly faster than the ryzen 5 one by about 10%. For ‚Ç¨40 more yeah i would say its worth it",
  "Cant really say but its most likely similar to this one but with a stronger gpu and cpu",
  "Its holding up great the battery and performance is still good",
  "In reality it has yet to arrive, they're taking a long time to ship and maybe I'm changing my mind, opting for a thinkpad for ‚Ç¨100 more though",
  "Hi, this I assume. Does your model support DP Alt Mode 1.4?",
  "I can buy the slim 3, witht he ryzen 7 only 16gb ram and 60Wh battery for ¬£466, worth ?",
  "ciao, potresti fare un aggiornamento? quale PC hai preso alla fine? a che thinkpad stavi pensando? ti trovi bene?",

  "Refurb Thinkpad 480 vs new Walmart Ideapad Slim 3i So, upon reading the many strong t480 reviews, I went looking for one. The thing is, it seems like everyone else did, as well, and I am having trouble finding a good unit with everything you'd want for less than $180, and $200-$220 is seeming more common. I really wanted the swappable battery, but I can probably live without it. \n\nNow I'm just wondering if the market has out-priced the value of these vs. a brand new unit. It looks like I can get a brand new Ideapad for about $270 plus tax at Walmart right now, and not even wait for shipping: \n\n  \n[https://www.walmart.com/ip/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Slim-3i-15-6-Laptop-Intel-Core-i3-N305-8GB-256-SSD-82XB00BMUS/13374211754?fulfillmentIntent=In-store&filters=%5B%7B%22intent%22%3A%22fulfillmentIntent%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%22In-store%22%5D%7D%5D&classType=REGULAR&athbdg=L1300&from=/search](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Slim-3i-15-6-Laptop-Intel-Core-i3-N305-8GB-256-SSD-82XB00BMUS/13374211754?fulfillmentIntent=In-store&filters=%5B%7B%22intent%22%3A%22fulfillmentIntent%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%22In-store%22%5D%7D%5D&classType=REGULAR&athbdg=L1300&from=/search)\n\nWhat's your opinion? Is there some better business refurb outside the t480 that I should be looking at that is just far and away better and/or cheaper than the new Ideapad? Should I keep looking for a cheap-ish t480? If I'm already giving up on the swappable battery by going with the Ideapad, would it just be much better to start looking at the later-gen business models instead. even if I have to wait for it? Time is sort of, a little, of the essence... if I could get a laptop purchased and in my hands this weekend, it would be ideal, because there's a practice test I want to do before starting a couple of classes next week-- but that's not a top priority if I'd be wasting a lot of money to pick one up today. Anyway, this model looks like it's over $400 on the Lenovo website... is this just a good deal on a decent laptop, and I should snap it up? I'm really looking for something that will work for 2-5 years through college, with some courses in statistics, data analytics, and probably one where I have to learn R, if that matters at all. Plus, of course, likely heavy videoconferencing. ",
  "You probably want to avoid the IdeaPad - its 8GB RAM is not upgradable and will be limiting.\n\nA refurb T480, or anything around that timeframe, isn't going to have terribly great battery life (plus battery health may not be great) or graphics performance. Make sure you get a 1920x1080 screen or better, some of them did have 1366x768 which is terrible. The hotswap battery isn't worth it imo (that would require you to actually buy additional batteries). The Ethernet port may be useful.",
  "Thank you! What do you think I should be looking for?",
  "I don't really know, sorry.\n\nYou probably want at least 16GB RAM. Windows Pro (which these refurb business laptops come with) might be useful at some point for WSL. No need to limit yourself to ThinkPad/Lenovo, Dell and HP are also in this segment.\n\nA very quick search on eBay gave [this](https://www.ebay.com/itm/316997795606) which seems like a steal at first glance - I haven't looked all that much at it though and am not recommending anything.\n\nAnything i5 or above, 8th gen or above is decent. There's a jump in performance/battery life at 11th gen.",
  "I worry about durability with manufacturers other than Lenovo. I will be lugging this thing all over campus, on buses, bike rides, etc. Especially worry about durability with HP and Dell. Should I?",
  "I really wouldn't as long as you stick to the mid-tier business line or higher. The consumer and budget business lines of all 3 are all not good.\n\nLooking at that particular listing, it actually looks darn good (assuming it's not lying and the pictures are accurate). Some highlights:\n\n- Has room for a second SSD which may be very handy in the future.\n- USB-C charging which may be handy going forward.\n- Webcam is only 1MP, unfortunately.\n- No Windows Hello face or fingerprint, unfortunately.\n- Battery may be on the small side (or may be on the large side - there are 2 options and can't tell which from listing).\n- Screen looks surprisingly bright - either it's an effect of the picture or this is actually a really good FHD screen (color accurate and bright).\n- Is a tad on the heavy side (3lb even) but still darn good for this price range.",
  "Thank you! That's very insightful. I actually use one of these from my employer for work, and I assumed they weren't considered durable just based on how it looks and feels. But just to be clear, completely ignoring the specs, is this thing likely to break if it's in my bag and I drop my bag? My old laptop I first had in college was like a tank, and that's the impression I get from like the t480's.",
  "I don't know for sure but I would expect this to have the same durability as the ThinkPad T line, just with a weaker-feeling keyboard. I haven't personally used the Latitude 5400 series, I have used the Latitude 7400 series and the ThinkPad P14s series and they seemed similar in quality (different feel though).\n\nHere's a [review](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-Latitude-14-5420-review-A-laptop-so-close-to-claiming-the-business-crown.595678.0.html) if you're interested.",

  "I just purchased this one for 29k with a 22k exchange on the old laptop. The Original price was around 51k RN....\n\nI bought this for my brother; he's about to start his master's, and he needs a good device to do and write some research papers. Most of the software he might be using is MS Office, zoom/teams for meetings, and mainly a browser for multimedia and all of his stuff. \n\nAnd while this one is giving unmatched battery life without a charger and no lag, while being the same or more powerful than other i5/i7 12th gen devices, i was checking in the 40-50k price range.

  "Review of Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 (15in, 16gb, 512gb SSD, AMD Ryzen 5700u) I bought the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 (15in, 16gb, 512gb SSD, AMD Ryzen 5700u) in India. Here is my review about it after using it for about 2 weeks.\n\n**Build:**\n\n* Update after 14 months (16 Oct 2022): Shit quality hinge. Broke twice till now without ever dropping the laptop.\n* Full plastic build. Metal Lid. Matte finish. Feels great and solid.\n* Keyboard and touchpad are great\n\n**General things:**\n\n1. Initially I had some problem with the speakers when they would stop working and I had to restart the laptop to fix. I got a driver update a couple days later, haven't had that same problem since.\n2. The fingerprint can be a hit or miss sometimes due to its design, I then added my fingerprint from multiple angles so mostly works but sometimes have to try again.\n3. My unit had some backlight bleed on the bottom right corner noticeable when in a dimly lit room at above 70% brightness. Not a problem for me since I dim the screen to around 30% in the dark. This will vary by laptop though.\n4. I have a problem with OBS recordings. It seems that OBS is recording at same volume as windows master volume. I haven't been able to find a fix for it. Every program I tried which captures audio from speakers to record/broadcast (OBS, XSlit, Anydesk) have the same issue.  **(EDIT: FIX: Roll Back Realtek (R) Audio drivers so that the manufacturer is Microsoft, Dolby audio will stop working though if you do it. Not recommended.)**\n5. The product description states that it has Bluetooth 5.0 but the device manager says its Bluetooth 5.1.\n\n**Expandability**:\n\nI opened mine up coz of curiosity. The internal design is the same as last years version.\n\n1. The RAM is soldered in dual channel. (Task Manager)\n2. There is one M.2 NVME SSD slot which is already populated with the 512 GB SSD.\n3. There is a space for an HDD but it doesn't come with the SATA cable installed, the SATA cable will need to be purchased separately to install a hard drive within the laptop.\n4. The laptop comes with WI-FI 5 and not WI-FI 6 unlike last years version. The WI-FI card is upgradable if you need WIFI 6.\n5. The internal battery can also be upgraded to 70 Whrs version. However note that if you do upgrade, it will occupy the HDD slot aswell.\n\nLink to Lenovo's Spare parts website of this model. [IdeaPad 5 ALC05 Type 92LN Spare parts](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/in/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/5-series/ideapad-5-15alc05/82ln/parts/display/compatible)\n\n**Battery life estimates from 100 percent battery (70% brightness):**\n\n1. Watching movies (Chrome with 5 extensions - 1 tab open, discord, telegram, anydesk, Battery saving mode active from Vantage software, Better battery saving mode in windows.) - 9hrs\n2. Moderate Multi tasking (Listening to music, actually using chrome, discord, qbittorrent (downloading) and a bunch of other background programs, Battery saving mode from Vantage software, Better battery saving mode in windows.) - 6 to 7 hrs\n\n* Note: I use my laptop on conservation mode all the time so it charges only to 60%. The battery life is based on the time it take to drain the laptop from 60% to around 30% and multiplying that by 3.\n* The conservation mode is not customizable. Its either 60% charge or 100% charge.\n* Also, I absolutely love the conservation mode, ~~no other brands have this~~ Asus and Dell also have it according to the internet. My laptop remains on the desk most of the time so I don't have to worry about it remaining on 100% all the time.\n\n**Fans (In an air conditioned room)**\n\n* On Battery- The laptop fans are completely off when watching movies. They may or may not turn on when multi tasking.\n* Plugged in- The fans only turned off when set to Battery Saving Mode in Vantage and doing light tasks.\n* Fans are inaudible (if they do turn on) when doing basic tasks in a room with air conditioner running, only slightly audible with the air conditioner off.\n\n**iGPU**:\n\n* Out of the 16gb ram, 2GB is dedicated for the iGPU, this can be changed in BIOS to 1GB or 512 MB.\n\n**Lenovo Power Management modes:**\n\n* Extreme Performance- TDP is 35 Watts.\n* Intelligent Cooling- TDP is 25 Watts.\n* Battery Saving Mode- TDP is 15 Watts.\n* On Battery, change to best performance (windows) and these modes function the same as plugged in.  I did notice that Battery Saver Mode (Vantage) turns on the fans later than the Intelligent cooling mode which is I guess nice if you're trying to save battery.\n\n**Performance Benchmarks (Plugged in)(Extreme Performance):**\n\n* **Cinnebench R23**\n   * Multi Core **-** 9655 points, 3.65 GHz across all cores, Max: 85 C, Power: 35 W\n   * Single Core **-** 1245 points, 4.3 Ghz single core, Max: 70 C, Power: 10 W\n* **Crystal DiskMark-** 2481 MB/s Read, 1726 MB/s Write\n\n**Performance Benchmarks on battery:**\n\nThe laptop can achieve full performance on battery as well, change from Better Battery mode to Best performance mode in the Windows battery settings.\n\n**Note:** On battery, Better Battery (and Battery Saver) mode locks the CPU at base clock of 1.8 Ghz to get maximum battery life. While using this mode, I did not suffer any hanging when doing casual tasks, (Web browsing, YouTube, Discord etc.)\n\nIf you wanna know something else about it. Please let me know. I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.\n\n* EDIT #1: Added Benchmarks.\n* EDIT #2: Photo of the internals. [https://imgur.com/a/5WCUKW4](https://imgur.com/a/5WCUKW4)\n   * Disassembly video from YouTube (not the exactly same model): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKF\\_9L1qfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKF_9L1qfY)\n* EDIT #3, #4: Added battery benchmarks, then deleted them because I tested them on Better battery mode which locks the clock speed to 1.8Ghz.\n* Edit #5: Cleaned up the post.\n   * Update as of 8 Sept 2021: I have been having some weird touchpad problem. [Details here](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-IdeaPad-1xx-3xx-5xx-7xx-Edge-LaVie-Z-Flex-Notebooks/Touchpad-sluggish-Latency-Lag/m-p/5095310). This has not been fixed after a touchpad replacement so currently working on it. The issue does seem isolated to just me though.\n* Edit #6: Update as of 16 Oct 2022: The hinge is shit quality, it has broken twice till now in the exact same manner with completely normal use.",
  "I can confirm that the hinge quality is garbage. I use mine almost entirely at home, after 2 years of use I have used it no more than 30 times outside. I very rarely open and close the lid when I use it at home because I can sense right from the beginning the hinge quality is not the best although I did not expect it to be this bad. And yet the hinge broke! Together with the LCD!\n\nI paid RM170 (around 39 USD) just to get the one time on site repair because they said repair at the depot would take around 2 weeks time and I had no spare laptop. The basic, send in to the depot warranty covered the spare parts, luckily. So if you guys are planning to buy this model, **do consider to upgrade to the onsite warranty to 3 or 4 years** (depending on how long you plan to use the device). \n\nThe technician who came even told me this model and the model 3 are plagued with this problem. 7 and thinkpads fair better. I wish I'd known.\n\nPerformance wise, it is amazing. Still running strong after two years. (I open many tabs on Edge daily, at times 30-50 tabs, rarely any hiccup.) i5 11 gen, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Heat management is superb as well. It heats up but never overheat, not once.\n\nCheers,  \nR.",
  "Thank you for the review! This is by far the most comprehensive one I've read about this laptop as it's just been released.\n\nI have a few questions-\n1. Do you notice a significant drop in performance (general multi tasking) when on battery vs plugged in?\n2. Does the 100% screen brightness hold up in well-lit rooms or under the sun?\n3. How was the initial set-up process like? Did you install any specific programs/drivers that helped?",
  "Thankx for the review, based on it I will no more 'struggle' with choosing a new laptop from Lenovo, I got a bit scared haha. I'm gonna carry on with my HP's. They have not failed me yet, and I have been happy with performances so far. :)",
  "**Beware: Major Touchpad Problem**\n\nI bought a Lenovo Ideapad Silm 5 laptop in Aug 23, and I thought all is well until a few months in. My touchpad stopped functioning but thankfully, the onsite warranty allowed me to change my motherboard. A few months down the road, the same issue arose, and I was told by the customer hotline to undergo numerous upgrading of software, restarting of laptop, etc, and the touchpad would mysteriously function after a months/weeks until it breaks down again. This laptop is reaching its 1 year mark, and the same issue still persists. It has been a major inconvenience, especially since a mouse cannot entirely replace the functions of the touchpad (i.e. pinching in/out to enlarge the text). To my dismay, I was told by the onsite warranty engineer that the touchpad issue is rampant in laptops of this particular model. I asked for an upgrade of my laptop or replacement of another model, but I was told that this was not Lenovo's usual practice. Am still monitoring the issue after the engineer has replaced the touchpad (for second time), but if anything, **please do not purchase this model** unless you are willing to forgo its touchpad.\n\nTrust me, their onsite warranty they provide is not worth in exchange for your sanity if you were to constantly experience the same issue. The warranty team somehow does not understand what \"intermittent issue\" mean, and they'll put you through the arduous process of troubleshooting and restarting, only for you to find yourself back to square one.\n\nP.S. My USB ports were also not working, but it's fixed atm.",

  "Why, kind sir, did you decide on the 15 in version instead of the 14 in? Was there any other reason than personal preference?",
  "Omg, Thank You soo much for posting this review!!\n\n\nI am unable to decide between this Ideapad and the Legion 5 with 4600H as both are very similarly priced. \n\nCould you tell me what price did you buy this at? Cause right now, it is 68k INR. And is it worth the price?\n\n\nHow is the cooling on this laptop? Does it heat up under medium-heavy loads? Especially without air conditioning.\n\n\nDoes it stutter or lag a bit when you launch an app or open a web browser or type? Especially when on battery?\n\n\n\nI tried the Intel model for the Ideapad which apparently uses the same body and parts as the Ryzen 5700U model. I did not find the keyboard and the touchpad as good as I was expecting (but I could be wrong cause I only tried it for a few seconds). \n\n\nIs the battery replaceable/ easily removeable by the user? Or does one have to take it to a service center?\n\nI was also considering the HP laptops with Ryzen 5500U but the 15in (my preferred screen size) has a TN panel while the 14in does have IPS but is glossy (I need antiglare so it doesn't strain my eyes).\n\n\nThe Ideapad 5 and Legion 5 just seem so much better.",

  "Valuable information my friend, I have a similar laptop but the Pro series. Would I see a major difference in battery drain and temperature, if I turn on Extreme Performance in BIOS but Balanced mode on Windows?\n\nAlso, does it make any sense to do this for gaming purposes? Because if you're going to play while the system is AC wired the TDP would be higher than 25W anyways, am I right?",

  "Hi,\n\n1. The performance drop is not noticeable doing casual tasks on battery vs plugged in. Tried loading web pages and video playback. 4k60fps video playback is smooth on both. \n2. 100% screen brightness definitely holds up in a well lit room, I cam easily manage at 70% brightness in my room. This is probably the best you'll get in this price range, most competition only offer 250 nit screens while this is a 300 nit screen.\n3. Set-up process is pretty classic for windows. The only bloatware was McAfee which I promptly uninstalled. I found once that Lenovo Voice assistant was using 50% of the CPU (it may be updating), so uninstalled that as well. As for driver updates, Lenovo Vantage software is great, check for system updates and install the updated audio drivers from there.",

  "No need to go into BIOS to change performance mode, you can just change them from within windows with Lenovo Vantage. Or press Fn+Q\n\n***About the second question:-***      \nWhile AC is connected windows power modes don't really do much so you can ignore them. Between the three windows power modes there is very little difference in terms of CPU power usage (maybe 1W difference between each mode).\n\nBIOS performance modes behave exactly the same both on battery and AC. Which means TDP limits will be the same on both AC and battery. Which means if the game demands more than 25W sustained power, Intelligent cooling mode will limit performance.\n\n***About the first question:***\n\n**Under low load:-**   \nThe difference in battery life will only be caused by the fact that extreme performance mode likes to enable the fans even under very light load.\n\n**Under moderate load:-**    \nThere should be no difference for battery life and heat output in between the different BIOS power modes or windows power modes.\n\nThe reason why low and moderate load don't cause significant differences in battery life between the different power modes because the CPU only uses as much power as it needs, it is not going to consume more power if the program itself doesn't require it.\n\n**For heavy load:**\n\n**If using better battery mode (windows):**    \nThere should again be no difference in between any of the BIOS power modes.\n\n**If using better performance or best performance mode (windows):**     \nThere will be lesser battery life and greater heat output in Intelligent cooling mode compared to Battery saving mode. The difference would be greater in Extreme performance mode. However, you will also be getting better performance.",

  "Ideapad AMD Ryzen 7 4700U vs. Slim 7 Intel i7-1065G7 vs. Aspire Intel i5-10210U + MX250 I've been looking for a budget/midrange laptop to replace my aged Dell Latitude with 3rd gen i5. After following r/LaptopDeals and Slickdeals to get a sense of the current US market, I selected 3 new laptops and had the fortune of trialing them out within the return window. I've compiled some thoughts and benchmark data below. Please feel free to ask me any questions.\n\nTL;DR: It seems like the ultimate midrange laptop would be a Lenovo Ideapad Slim 7 with a 4800U processor and a good anti-glare display - let's hope it's released broadly soon!\n\n# Laptop Specs\n\n|Laptop Model|Dell Latitude 6430u|Acer Aspire 5 15.6\" A515-54G-53H6|Lenovo Ideapad Slim 7 15\" 15IIL05|Lenovo Ideapad 5 14\" 14ARE05|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Retail Price|$1,300|$650|$1,200|$860|\n|Purchased Price (w/ coupons, cashback, excl. tax)|$1,300|$650|$840|$700|\n|Processor|Intel i5-3427U|Intel i5-10210U|Intel i7-1065G7|AMD Ryzen 7 4700U|\n|Graphics|Integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000|Integrated Intel Graphics + NVIDIA GeForce MX250|Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics|AMD Radeon Graphics (Vega 7)|\n|RAM|4 GB DDR3|8 GB DDR4|16 GB LPDDR4X|16 GB DDR4|\n|Storage|256 GB SSD|512 GB SSD|512 GB SSD|512 GB SSD|\n|Display|14\" 1366x768, 200 nits, 55% sRGB, anti-glare|15.6\" 1920x1080, 300 nits, 51% sRGB, anti-glare|15.6\" 1920x1080, 300 nits, 100% sRGB, glossy|14\" 1920x1080, 300 nits, 60% sRGB, anti-glare|\n|Connectivity|802.11 g/n|Wifi 6 + Bluetooth 5.0|Wifi 6 + Bluetooth 5.0|Wifi 6 + Bluetooth 5.0|\n|Battery Capacity (Wh)|60|48|71|57|\n|Weight (lbs)|3.7|3.8|4.1|3.1|\n\n# Performance Benchmarks\n\nI ran some benchmark tests on each laptop and have indexed the scores to the Acer Aspire 5 performance below. All laptops were running minimal background programs, plugged in, and set to the 'Best Performance' Windows power mode. I haven't adjusted any TDP settings or undervolted anything.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 4700U and i7-1065G7 both crush multi-core tasks compared to the entry-level 10th gen i5.  While 4700U single-core performance is very comparable across the three latest chips, it is an undisputed winner in multi-core tests. It's crazy how far computing power has come - the 4700U is over 5x as fast as the old i5-3427U!\n\n[CPU Benchmark Scores](https://preview.redd.it/tnx8rsmhjl151.png?width=1089&format=png&auto=webp&s=473ac2c5dbc977afb15c8cdfe549f9308b04bafd)\n\nI ran Cinebench R20 multi-core tests back-to-back to get a sense of the steady state output. The 4700U does drop 16% from a peak score of 3189 but still has over a 50% edge on the i7-1065G7.\n\n[Cinebench R20 Multi-Core Runs in a loop](https://preview.redd.it/90ylvczjjl151.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=2797a6c4c5dd8e5b7f2f44b330db09637e9d70fe)\n\nThe integrated Radeon graphics on the Ryzen 7 4700U is supposedly Vega 7, but I didn't see that specified anywhere. Nevertheless, this was a comparison I was excited to do because of the curiosity around how the Radeon graphics stack up to Ice Lake and separately a dedicated entry-level NVIDIA MX250.\n\n[GPU Benchmark Scores](https://preview.redd.it/qwvzaoomjl151.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c6051fc635579017d31e0ede02ce0be0f562770)\n\nLastly, I used Novabench to gauge speeds on the RAM and disk. It seems like the Slim 7 has the more premium configuration and parts (LPDDR4X at higher MHz).\n\n[RAM + Disk Benchmark Scores](https://preview.redd.it/yu56pbdojl151.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=77982e67ac1b50499c63548ca0b37aaf74894f56)\n\n# Ideapad Slim 7 vs. 5 Display Comparison\n\nInitial reviews of the Ideapad Slim 5 have been largely positive other than the display quality and brightness. I don't consider display brightness an important factor as I typically work on the lowest brightness settings all the time. However, I was curious to see the difference between 60% sRGB and 100% sRGB because I do video/photo editing from time to time.\n\nBelow are a few comparisons of the Ideapad 5 (left) and Ideapad Slim 7 (right) screens at max and min brightness. Having used each device for a couple days, I do appreciate the color accuracy of the Slim 7 a lot, but I prefer having an anti-glare screen over a glossy one.\n\n[Ideapad 5 \\(left\\) vs. Ideapad Slim 7 \\(right\\) in the desktop view at max brightness](https://preview.redd.it/bluvfvzrjl151.png?width=2568&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ff576eea4dc66a8532f9e1fb3d39498dba9d5b4)\n\n[Ideapad 5 \\(left\\) vs. Ideapad Slim 7 \\(right\\) with a random picture at max brightness](https://preview.redd.it/95gnxayvjl151.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7eaf22d5060bd69a5dc0baccdc8c0d10ed832d)\n\n[Ideapad 5 \\(left\\) vs. Ideapad Slim 7 \\(right\\) with a random picture at min brightness](https://preview.redd.it/ucmlu9dyjl151.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e688ef20e4dcce8628ad85cabc7ea3b6f725ade)\n\n# Other Thoughts\n\n**Acer Aspire 5**\n\nThe A515-54G-53H6 felt like a decent deal for the price and specs. Supposedly, I could have upgraded the RAM from 2x4 GB to 20 GB, but I never opened up the internals. The fan was surprisingly loud during idle and web browsing, and the battery life of 7-8 hrs on idle definitely left more to be desired. The dimensions felt a bit large for a 15.6\" and the construction felt ok, just not super solid.\n\n**Lenovo Ideapad Slim 7**\n\nThis felt like a premium laptop right away. The fan came on during light games and benchmarking, but didn't seem too loud in a quiet room. The two USB-Cs + Thunderbolt 3 are definitely a great feature and left me spoiled once I received the Ideapad 5. The laptop did feel a bit heavy at 4.1 lbs and the nice metal finish seemed to scratch easily, although you can buff out minor ones.\n\nI would have kept this machine if it had an anti-glare screen and if there weren't a substantial price difference vs. the Ideapad 5. I don't think I would notice 4700U vs. i7-1065G7 performance differences in real world use that much.\n\n**Lenovo Ideapad 5**\n\nAfter using the Slim 7, this laptop felt like more of a budget choice. The bezels aren't as razor thin and elegantly trimmed. The trackpad has a greater click depression that makes it feel cheaper. Otherwise, as other reviews have mentioned, the build quality is surprisingly good. I'm perfectly happy with this given the effective price that I got it at. I also prefer the portability of the 14\" over premium features such as an IR camera. This is a strong upgrade over my Dell Latitude 6430u and I would be happy to keep this for the next few years!",
  "The Ideapad Slim 7 looks good! But it would much better with the Ryzen 7 4700U from the Ideapad 5",
  "Thank you for this post!",
  "Does the IdeaPad Slim 7 support Tb3 or data transfer on both ports? Based on the psref it seems one of the usb-c only does power delivery and doesn't carry data?\n\nThank you.",
  "I'm happy with the same model you had at the $750 price point I got it at but I would be much more excited if I could just swap the processor for a 4700U and keep the 16GB of RAM.",
  "The psref is right, the back USB-C is for charging only.",
  "If you‚Äôre talking about the Slim 7, then yeah, you‚Äôre in the same boat with lots of people!",
  "That's really silly and a waste of a perfectly good port... No idea why there is no true successor for the 720s and S730 13 inch...",
  "Yes the Slim 7. Like a lot of others have commented, it almost seems like Lenovo is intentionally trying to pin AMD into the \"budget\" category by relegating it to a much lower price point and only 8GB of RAM. I saw the 14\" Slim 7 with 4700U/8GB/512GB for $769 on pre-order at Adorama (they just removed it apparently). It makes no sense because the 4700U is like 75% faster in multi and the GPU is 20%+ faster than the 1065G7 with lower TDP. Intel still gets better Super Pi 1M scores though, so that's something hahaha.  \n\nI'm not sure you're right about the Slim 7 1065G7 having a $905 MSRP. I think that was a sale price and MSRP is still $1200ish.",
  "Yes you‚Äôre right, the Slim 7 i7-1065G7 full price is $1200, but the release batch had promotional pricing at $905 until it sold out.\n\nIt looks like the Slim 7 14‚Äù AMD is finally out, but just with an 8 GB configuration and with no promotional pricing. I have no idea why they would pair 4700U with 16 GB in the 5 line, but not the 7. The 4800U would be the real jewel, and with this release strategy and the pandemic, who knows when that might be",
  "Pretty late to the party but did you seriously get the 4700U slim 7 for $769? It's currently [$899](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-700-series/IdeaPad-Slim-7-14ARE05/p/88IPS701400) at Lenovo's website right now and I feel like paying that much would be a ripoff compared to yours!",
  "No I got the 15.6\"/i7 1065G7/16GB/512GB for $750, and I said I saw the 4700/8GB/512GB for $769 on Adorama before they took the product page down.",
  "Ah I see. Thanks! How do you like the build quality of the Slim 7? Is it one of the cheaper feeling metal devices or is it something that feels really premium? How's the display? Battery life? I'm probably going to purchase it in a week or two (if it's available) and would like to know your general take on it as well if you don't mind. I'll be getting the model with the Ryzen 7 for $899 (before I apply student discount).",
  "Feels mid-high-tier. Very similar to the C940 except the hinge design uses more plastic (cheaper). The 15.6\" version definitely feels like a $1000+ laptop, but if you look very closely you can tell the tolerances in manufacturing are worse than in more premium devices like the XPS, i.e. small gaps or asymmetries in the chassis, and the plastic hinge is a bit of a bummer. The Slim 7 still looks and feels better than anything HP/Acer/others have on offer in the price range currently.",
  "Thank you for the insight! I'm not looking for XPS build quality but just something that is a good step up from plastic and feels pretty sturdy for college. Hopefully this fits the bill!",
  "Yeah man. I can only attest to the 1080p 15.6\" Intel one. The display is over 300 nits and looks really good, but having a brighter display would definitely be better. The one thing I wish it had that the C940 has is that brighter 400 nit display. Guess that's Lenovo's way of establishing that the Slim 7 is in its premium but still mid-range category; giving it a nicer than average 1080p screen with a mundane brightness output. I think the 14\" you are looking at is in a similar category.",
  "Would this be a good/long lasting laptop for university?

Usually you'll buy a 1500 dollar laptop for 400 dollars that way.",
  "I have this exact laptop. I like it realy ( i study fysiotherapie)",
  "Lenovo has recently been popular for dying motherboards in the long run some happen in 2 years. A Reddit user said the problem is only affecting those that have been \"low temperature soldered \" which Lenovo has used since 2020.\nI think its better to consider other brands like Asus or HP at least theirmotherboardsdon'tdie on you.",
  "Get a MacBook, best money can buy.",
  "I purchased a similar model earlier this year and would not suggest a model with soldered ram that's not expandable/replaceable. You'll find that this machine will be annoyingly slow. I have a few chrome tabs up and they eat up a little over 3GB alone.  You can find something way better for the same price at Best Buy.",
  "If you find anyone with 16gb ram and more storage (at least 512gb) it would be much better, anyways that one isn't bad either, all depends on your budget",
  "Slim 3 and long-lasting in one sentence?? No chance",
  "I would get a IdeaPad or any Lenovo laptop that is either made from actually strong plastic or metal‚Ä¶ Or get a used ThinkPad for less",
  "I was considering one but they‚Äôre a lot more expensive and I‚Äôm on a budget tbh üò≠üò≠",
  "Why is that?",
  "Really? I feel like my other device had 128gb and I‚Äôm not even close to filling it up this may sound stupid but would it apply differently to a laptop? thank you sm!",
  "Thank you!! But I‚Äôm a little worried on getting something refurbished just for it to have hidden issues that I‚Äôll discover too late and I‚Äôll have wasted my money",
  "How so? Like what specifications should I look for instead?",
  "First of all thank you so much for this in depth response! Also what do you mean by fully format and reinstall? I considered getting a used one but to be honest I‚Äôm extremely concerned with issues that may come with that and lack of warranty and potential hidden issues that wouldn‚Äôt show until it‚Äôs too late",
  "Really?? How long have you had it and how is the battery life and is the computer slow to process things or not?",
  "Ohh I didn‚Äôt know! I assumed since so many people around me bought Lenovos that they were better than hp and asus, also I know this may sound stupid, but does the motherboard die due to lack of care or is it like a wear and tear thing I can‚Äôt prevent?",
  "I most definitely do not have the budget for a MacBook üò≠üò≠",
  "Ooooh okay thank you sm!!",
  "Okay thank you!!",
  "Oh so is it a series thing? I‚Äôve seen a lot of laptops from this series are they all not long lasting? If so why?",
  "Ohhh okay thank you!!",
  "I guess he meant second hand Thinkpad, bc they really are quite expensive new",
  "Chrome alone uses 8gb ram",
  "OS, and future updates will take a big chunk, so will all your files and any software you need to use for uni.",
  "Your other device was not a laptop.",
  "I had the same mentality, except you should be fine as long as its a business class laptop (especially a thinkpad), the shop is reputable, and you have a warranty.",
  "At least look for something with 16GB",
  "If you want to erase a hard disk so there's nothing left, you have to format it. It'll actually not erase anything but it'll make the computer think there's nothing in that location. and when it needs space it'll just overwrite it. To you the disk will seem empty.  \nYou will then need to reinstall windows by making a usb stick from the microsoft website (it's free), starting the computer from that stick and then putting windows on it from scratch.  \nIt's not something I recommend you do if you have no experience, but it's usually not that expensive to have it done. Or maybe you have friends who want to do it.   \nI'd do it for you for free but I see the price is in dollars, so you're nowhere near me (Netherlands :D).",
  "Not really due to lack of care. Just recently my friend bought one and said he is returning his Lenovo Legion 5 Pro RTX 5060, i asked why he said the cooling is terrible with watching a YouTube video making the CPU temperature reach 80 Celsius and not going down, then to help him I looked and searched a lot then came across this  post\n\n https://www.reddit.com/r/LenovoLegion/s/fgQ8Q9qou6\n\nI think you should really read it carefully if you plan on buying a Lenovo as it appears the issue is not affecting only one line of brand but all. Just search on Reddit this \" lenovo motherboard \" and it will frighten you.",
  "They are cheaper than ever. You‚Äôll be surprised.",
  "They are made of cheap quality plastic.within no time you'll be having problems with hinges and display.so, unless you have strict budget constraints this is not a good choice. Slim 5 models have metal bodies. But still buy a ThinkPad if you can",
  "Yeah I guess so thank you!",
  "Thank you for saying that.  Sorry I forgot to mention that.",
  "Really? I have a friend who has a 8gb laptop and I was browsing on chrome on it the other day and it was fine to me? Is there something I may be missing?",
  "Ohhhhh okay thank you!",
  "Yeah it wasn‚Äôt üò≠",
  "All right thank you!",
  "Okay thank you!! But if I can‚Äôt find one within my budget, would the 8gb one still function fine?",
  "Thank you so much this is so helpful!! Thank you also for offering but yeah we are pretty far I‚Äôd say HAHA",
  "Woah this is really helpful I had no idea thank you so much!!!",
  "Ohhh okay thank you sm!!!",
  "Well you might be fine! Most of time it would work well enough for your use case. I assume when people say \"its not enough ram\" they're taking the safer route.",
  "Then that's no comparison :).   \nThat's like saying 'my motorbike had a one gallon tank and I got everywhere, so my car only needs a 1 gallon tank'.",
  "If you're doing something light like writing in word documents and taking notes, yes",
  "Oohhhh okay thank you sm!!",
  "LMAOO this made me laugh but I get it now HAHA",
  "Okay thank you so much! Also would you know whether or not it would get slower over time? Or does that just depend on how I take care of it?",
  "If you're someone who use a lot of browser tabs, then you'll start to feel the limitations of 8GB real quick",
  "Depends honestly. Keep your drivers up to date and don't bloat it with useless stuff and you should be oki dorey.\n\n  \n\\+ if you want something that is durable and lightweight, you should look into Linux.",
  "Ohh so would it function fine if I just don‚Äôt keep a lot of tabs open?",
  "Oooh alright! I‚Äôll definetly look into it, also what does keeping drivers up bloating it with useless stuff mean lol I‚Äôm really lost when it comes to this stuff üò≠",
  "Your computers requires drivers to work (See them as some sort of translators for your machine and its components to understand each other) and keeping them up-to-date is something important.\n\nBloating is keeping useless stuff on your computer.",
  "Ohhhhh okay thank you so much for bearing with my lack of knowledge I really appreciate it!!",

You're probably mind blown right now huh? The [Zenbook 14](https://allelectrodeals.com/product/asus-zenbook-14-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-mx350-256gb-ssd-light-gray/) has a good display which makes it good for content creators who like to do lightroom, photoshop and video editing. The bezels are really slim which gives the Zenbook 14 a nice, sleek, and modern appearance. It weighs up to 2.65lbs and is 0.72 inches thin which makes this laptop portability amazing! The laptop is made out of plastic and has a cheap feel to it but hey, the specs and performance that this laptop provides for the price is just amazing. The laptop can be opened with one hand and has an ergo-lift hinge which improves airflow. \n\nDon't want to open your laptop with a password/pin? Don't worry, Windows Hello is on the way! The Zenbook 14 has a face recognition feature that identifies you very well. The [Zenbook 14](https://allelectrodeals.com/product/asus-zenbook-14-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-mx350-256gb-ssd-light-gray/) has a 720p webcam which is pretty decent and a full-size backlit keyboard with a 1.4mm key travel. One downside though is that the backlight is not that bright on the keyboard. It has a precision touchpad that supports two-finger scrolling and feels great. Furthermore, the Zenbook has a 50Wh Lithium-ion Battery which will get you around 8 hours when web surfing, watching youtube videos, and while the screen is about 200 nits.  Moving on to the ports, on the left side there are the power port, HDMI port, USB A port, and a USB Type C port which unfortunately does not support charging or Thunderbolt 3. On the right side, there are a MicroSD card slot, another USB A port and a 3.5mm audio jack.\n\nTo open the back of the laptop you would need to open 9 screws, 7 which are visible as you turn over the laptop and 2 which are under the top rubber pads. Once inside the laptop you will be greeted with a single fan with one heat pipe. The Zenbook 14 comes with a 256GB PCIe SSD which is upgradable. Additionally, it also comes with an 8GB LPDDR4X Memory stick with a speed of 4266MHz which is unfortunately soldered to the motherboard. The Zenbook has Dual-band WiFi 6 along with Bluetooth 5.0. \n\nThe performance on the [Zenbook 14 ](https://allelectrodeals.com/product/asus-zenbook-14-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-mx350-256gb-ssd-light-gray/)is good for this price range.

  "Which one is better? (For light gaming, school, and browsing) ",
  "The AMD is about 25% faster and also has slightly better graphics performance (Vega 8 versus XE 80eu) than the Intel but also uses a little bit more power (6 watts more)\n\nWhat do you consider like gaming? Neither one of them has a dedicated GPU. They both use an iGPU built into the CPU die and are only really good for video playback, older games, and very light modern games.",
  "A bit of a correction, I forgot to account for iGPU power consumption. \n\nWhen adding together the power consumption of the CPU and the iGPU, the AMD uses less watts than the Intel.\n\nAMD is the winner.",
  "Avoid like the plague any Ideapad that isn‚Äôt the Pro 5, they‚Äôre badly built.",

  "What is light gaming? Just get an M(1-4) MacBook and call it a day. Especially at this price range.",

  "What laptop should I buy? Hey everyone! I‚Äôm planning to buy a new laptop soon, and I could really use some advice before making the final decision. My budget is around **$600 USD** or less, and I‚Äôm looking for a laptop that performs well, looks good, and works smoothly for daily tasks. I mainly need it for **work**, which involves a lot of **video calls**, so a decent **built-in webcam** is actually one of my top priorities. I also tend to have multiple apps and browser tabs open at once, so smooth **multitasking** is really important to me.\n\nOutside of work, I‚Äôd like the laptop to handle some casual gaming from time to time. It would be nice if it could run a few games comfortably without overheating or lagging. I also spend a fair amount of time streaming shows and videos, editing documents and presentations, and maybe doing some basic photo or video editing here and there when needed. Overall, I‚Äôm looking for a laptop that can handle everyday tasks with ease while still being enjoyable and comfortable to use.\n\nI‚Äôve already done a bit of research and found a few models that seem to fit my needs, but I‚Äôm still not sure which one offers the best overall value. I‚Äôll list them below with their prices, along with some quick notes on what I‚Äôve found so far, but I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts or any recommendations you might have.\n\n**$450 USD Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15IAH8**\\- 15.6\" FHD (TN, 250 nits) Intel Core i5-12450H (8 cores, 12 threads), 8GB (soldered) DDR5, 512GB SSD M.2 2242, 1080p Webcam, WiFi 6 , Bluetooth 5.2 , Windows 11 Home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the laptop's material feels cheap, it gets hot quickly, and the battery doesn't last long. It also struggles with gaming and can shut down randomly. While positive reviews say the image quality and Dolby audio are decent, and the camera is great for video calls. The performance is acceptable for work and school. It opens programs fast and charges quickly.\n\nThe second laptop is the same Lenovo laptop but it's the one with an **AMD Ryzen 5 7520U** processor, it does have some other differences so these are the full specs: AMD Ryzen 5 7520U (4C/8T, 2.8/4.3GHz, 2MB L2/4MB L3) 16GB RAM | 512GB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe | 15.6\" matte screen | Windows 11 Home (and Pro on another site). Camera: HD 720p with a privacy shutter.\n\nNegative reviews say that the display isn‚Äôt very bright, that it lacks touch functionality, and that the colors have a slight greenish tint. They trash the webcam, saying it's only 720p and not great. The hinge goes all the way back, and the keyboard isn‚Äôt backlit. The fan can get noisy during gameplay too.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has an impressive battery life, lasting about 10-11 hours with regular use. The 1080p display is decent, and the built-in speakers sound pretty good. The keyboard is snappy, and the large trackpad is accurate. It has a fingerprint reader for extra security, and you can even open the laptop with one hand.\n\n**$550 Acer Aspire Lite** 15.6\" FHD, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 8 cores Windows 11 Home | integrated AMD Radeon Graphics. DDR4 3200 MHz M.2 PCLE NVMe.\n\nAccording to some reviews, the battery life isn't that good, like 4-5 hours. This is the laptop that the sales clerk recommended. They said the camera quality is decent (like a normal one you would get at this price range).\n\n**$530 ASUS Vivobook Go 15** | AMD Ryzen 5 7520U | 16GB | 512GB SSD | 15.6\" | Windows 11 Home | 2.8GHz (6MB Cache, up to 4.3GHz, 4 cores, 8 Threads) FHD 60 Hz AMD Radeon Web Camera 720p.\n\nNegative reviews say that the fans are slightly loud. It's not suitable for video and photo editing. The webcam is mediocre, not the best one, basically.\n\nPositive reviews say that the battery lasts 7 hours and it charges fully in 1 hour. One review even said that the webcam quality was decent enough.\n\n**$550 ASUS Vivobook 15** AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 16 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM 512 GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD 8 cores integrated AMD Radeon Graphics - 15.6‚Ä≥ FHD windows 11 home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the battery life is not quite long enough to last a full day of work or classes. 1080p display has a cool tint, and it‚Äôs heavy at 3.8 pounds.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has above-average build quality and, reliable fingerprint reader on its trackpad. Its backlit keyboard was quiet and satisfying to type on, and its trackpad worked well.\n\nI don't know if this changes anything, but I'm based in Latin America, so do with that information what you will.

I‚Äôm looking to replace my current laptop (Lenovo Z50, Intel Core i7).\n\nWith coupons and discounts I can get the new Galaxy Book 5 (15.6\", Intel Core Ultra 5, 16GB) for ‚Ç¨450, but I can‚Äôt find any reviews or detailed info about it anywhere.\n\nOther options I‚Äôm considering are:\n\n* **Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15IRH10** ‚Äì 15.3\" WUXGA, Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-13620H, 16GB RAM, 1TB\n* **ASUS Vivobook 15 F1504VA-NJ510W** ‚Äì 15.6\" Full HD, Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-1355U, 16GB RAM\n\nBoth the Lenovo and the Asus would cost me around ‚Ç¨650+, which is why I‚Äôm unsure whether to go for the Galaxy Book 5 at that lower price or stretch my budget for one of the other models.\n\nI just want a reliable replacement for my laptop that lasted over 10 years. I don‚Äôt game or use it for professional workloads, but I do want something powerful for heavy internet use (lots of tabs), multimedia, and long-term durability.\n\nThanks for your help!",
  "I know a number of folks with Galaxy Book 5 laptops which simply haven't been happy. Complaints have differed, although they tend to be about durability.¬†\n\n\nBetween the Lenovo & ASUS, the IdeaPad Slim 3 15IRH10 has the most powerful CPU, DDR5 RAM with one officially upgradable to 24GB, unofficially to 40GB, & will be easier to service/find in years to come.\n\n\nAlternately, I know some that will swear by there¬† F1504VA. Have a close acquaintance which recently \"traded up\" earlier F1504 (Core i7-1255U) for the more recent [ASUS Vivobook 16 M1607KA Ryzen AI 7 350](https://amzn.eu/d/bBkz0Xy). She was looking for something with more processing power & greater graphics capability. Only complaint was no USB4, which was something she was looking for.",
  "I really appreciate your help.  \nMost likely I‚Äôll go for the Lenovo. You‚Äôve been really helpful.",
  "Personally, that would be my choice.¬†\n\n\nCheers!",
  "Deciding between Lenovo Slim 3i and Asus Vivobook 16 for work Help! I‚Äôm looking to get a laptop that costs than $700 CAD for work and I‚Äôve narrowed it down to these options. I have credit from Best Buy so I‚Äôm kind of stuck with them. I have a desktop computer which I use 80% of the time but I need a laptop for whenever I go to conferences, do presentations or work outside of my usual space. I mainly need it for Microsoft Office (Teams, Outlook, Excel, Word, PP), Airtable, web browsing. Secondary tasks would be downloading and uploading video files, some video editing on Premiere or Photoshop (I mainly do it on my desktop computer but it would be great to have a backup)",

  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",

  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb.

  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! üôÇ",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! üôÇ\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! üôÇ",
  "Laptop recommendations for school and gaming Hello everyone, im approaching my senior year of college and I‚Äôve decided to get a new laptop. \n\nI am currently a comp sci student so I‚Äôll need something that is able to run programming software, and I‚Äôd like to do some gaming on it like league of legends or Roblox.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions?

  "I have the second one, the Slim 5i and I would not recommend it for $700 in 2025 for three reasons.\n\nIt is slim but takes up a lot of surface area with the taller 16:10 screen ratio. Not something you want to carry around. \n\nThe big screen would be great but it isn't color accurate or bright. Has a 45% NTSC rating where everything including YouTube feels washed out with a layer of white colors. Basically the same screen they were using in 2021, and likely just threw it on here because they have a lot of old stock.\n\nThe internals feels underpowered and lacks quality. Trackpad makes a flimsy clicky noise, keyboard isn't as polished with key travel, speakers sound tinny with no bass, webcam feels like a phone camera from 2015, it doesn't have 40 GBps thunderbolt 4 instead just basic 5GBps USB c ports. The Core 7 is a rebranded 2023 processor, not to be confused with the new Core ULTRA 7 processor from 2024.\n\nIf you haven't already you can go to a Costco and see these on display and play around with them.

  "Options for general use + work Hello,\n\n  \nI'm looking for a laptop for general web browsing, but also would have to use it for work.\n\nAs for work, I need some basic office suits like document writings and also some programming/data analysis using Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy and scipy.\n\n  \nIt would be ideal that it would have a long battery life. I'm not interested in games.\n\n  \nI found some options that might fit my needs, although there are some notes that I may add further down below. These are my top 3 picks:\n\n  \n1. Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5\n\n* 13.3'' inch screen (100% sRGB)\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7735 HS\n* 16GB LPDDR5x-6400 RAM\n* 512GB SSD\n* Price: \\~ 940 USD\n\n2. Asus Vivobook 14\n\n* 14'' screen (45% NTSC)\n* Intel Core Ultra 5 225H\n* 16GB DDR5 on board (it doesn't specify the frequency)\n* 512 GB SSD\n* Price: \\~ 940 USD\n\n3. Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3\n\n* 14'' screen (45% NTSC)\n* Intel Core i5-13420H\n* 24GB DDR5-4800 MHz (8GB on board + 16GB SO-DIMM)\n* 512GB SSD\n* Price: \\~870 USD\n\n  \nSo, a few notes to be added. I was initially thinking of buying laptops with the U series intel CPUs. But could only find from past generations, at most 13th. By the way, the new Intel name scheme seems confusing to me. Why not keep the same nomenclature as before?!\n\n\n\nThe IdeaPad Slim 3 seems to me like a good option because of the increase in the RAM, even though the CPU is from 2 generations ago.\n\n\n\nI know the IdeaPad Slim 5 is also with a CPU from 2023, but I really like the idea of having a small and light laptop like this. I previously owned a heavy gaming laptop and it was horrible to carry it around everywhere. Looking for the opposite now, so this one looks like a good option. However, I'm also looking for long battery life, and I don't know how a HS CPU would affect this.\n\n  \nThe Asus has the most modern CPU, but I've seen a review where it states that the body, keyboard etc are not so good.\n\n  \nAt any rate, I would appreciate any comment on those options. Is the the new Ultra 5 worth it, even though the laptop itself is fragile and not good? Would the increase in RAM make the IdeaPad Slim 3 a better option on cost/benefit?",
  "All of those should be fine for your use cases. Personally I would choose number 3, because you could upgrade the RAM if you need to in future. Also for your programming are you going to be any machine learning tasks? If so, I might recommend getting a laptop with a GPU.",
  "What laptop should I get? I'm an engineering student who also works in research and coding, and I'm looking for a new laptop. I was currently using my dad's old ThinkPad T450s, and it lasted 8 years and still works smoothly, but the battery life has deteriorated a lo,t and it's just not portable anymore. I'm looking for a new laptop on a more student-friendly budget that would work well with VSCode/Vim, Linux, and VMs. Here are some of my choices:\n\n**ThinkPad E-series 14:**\n\n* Intel Core Ultra 5 125U Processor (E-cores up to 3.60 GHz, P-cores up to 4.30 GHz)\n* 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\n* Windows 11 Home\n* Cost: ‚Çπ68.9k\n\nI don't know much about the quality and performance of the ThinkPad E-series, though. Since it has a U-processor, I'm a bit unsure about its performance.\n\n**Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3:**\n\n* 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13620H processor\n* 16GB RAM LPDDR5-4800 | 512GB SSD, expandable up to 1TB\n* Cost: ‚Çπ66k\n\nHonestly, the processor seems good, but I've heard negative reviews about the build quality of IdeaPads.\n\n**MacBook Air:**\n\n* Apple M1 chip\n* 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage\n* Cost: ‚Çπ59k\n\nAlthough I've heard positive reviews of MacBook Airs from professionals, the storage throws me off a bit, and many people don't recommend them for college.\n\nSome of the other laptops I've considered are Lenovo LOQ and ASUS, but these are my personal top choices. If you guys have any suggestions for any other laptops or experience with any of the laptops listed above, I'd appreciate any advice.",
  "I am also looking at laptops but I can say one thing for sure. **Do not buy a MacBook**, a lot of engineering software is not compatible or doesn't run well. I get that they are attractive in terms of battery life and power but it's just not good for this type of work. \n\n\nI also noticed that intel works a bit better with low level programming and is a bit more stable with Linux. The new intel CPUs are quite nice with battery life and performance. \n\nFrom the laptops that you provided I would get the ThinkPad with intel 5 125U, the performance is alright, I am using a Ryzen 5 5600H and this intel is better in every way. The build quality on ThinkPad was always ok, the E series are a budget friendly for people that can't buy a T series or X1.\n\nEdit: the CPU in the IdeaPad is going to be a bit more powerful in computing but the integrated graphics are way worse and the power efficiency is also worse, so I guess if you value battery life and graphics, the ultra is the obvious choice.",

I also rename my computer at this stage by going to:\n\nRight click Start > System > Rename this PC. Give it a name that if it came up on the network no one would know what it is. Like SpiderMonkey. That way when people see the name they need to work a tiny bit harder to identify the device.\n\nGo to  windows settings. Start > cog or hold the WIN key + i  \nGo to privacy. Disallow EVERYTHING.  \nGo to Personalisation. Add Extra buttons to start menu. Turn off suggestions of any kind. Pick colours for Menus  \nImport my own 'Desktop Backgrounds' Folder I've built up over time and make one my background.\n\nFinally. Go to the task manager > More Details > Startup tab.  \nDisable anything you don't want to start when your computer starts. (Especially useful for laptops because this will save both processing power and battery life).\n\nWith most laptops you get a charge to 80% option. This means you can leave your charger plugged in and when it hits 80% charge it will trickle charge to keep the battery better for longer.\n\nApplications and customisation is of course subjective but one thing you never do it just give Microsoft everything. Turn off what you don't use and put electrical tape over your camera. I got my laptop back in september and I've not used the webcam once. Of course this is different for everyone. Either way.

  "gets rid of the unwanted bloat like u mentioned McAfee and apps that you'll probably never use lol, basically u get a slightly lighter version of windows 11 as it was meant to be (good on resources and ram and cpu usage also heat) \n\nin fact fresh installing windows every 8-10 months or at least once a year helps by miles, the performance, the random issues bugs glitches the general wear and tear  (which of course u won't notice now as it's a brand new system)\n\n\nGood luck and happy purchasing (hopefully u got your warranty extended tho)",
  "Ohhhh this ? For only 1K usd ? If that‚Äôs legit rush lol, if I could‚Äôve bought this I would‚Äôve bought it but they had to announce the 370 and 365 a week after I bought my laptop",

  "Laptop recommendation (under INR 50k or between USD500 to USD600 - 16GB RAM, 512GB /1TB nvme or ssd) Hi! I need advice and recommendations for a budget laptop purchase under or around Rs 50,000 (this figure is in INR, so factoring in expensive cost of laptops in India - approximately USD500 to USD600). The main usage will be accounting related work and related softwares/cloud apps. \n\nShould be 16GB RAM, 512GB/1TB ssd or nvme.\n\nSo, priorities are long term reliability, low heating, acceptable performance to last atleast 4 to 5 years, hardware should not fail just as warranty ends (amazon 1 star reviews on my selected laptops are giving me nightmares) and, lastly due to cost or value for money criteria - prefer AMD builds, of course Intel ones are welcome if they are reliable and cost-effective. \n\nI only have had desktops, so any useful advice is gratefully welcomed. Please let me know from your personal experience in case the laptop you own falls in this category. \n\nSo, far I could only finalize the following few (based on online reviews and AI queries):\n\nLenovo V15 G4 7730U. \n\nHP 15s-eq2182AU Ryzen 5 5500U. \n\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 1 AMD Ryzen 5 5500U 82R400ERIN\n\nAny helpful replies are appreciated. \n\nHave a great day ahead!",
  "HELP!! I was thinking of purchasing a laptop which light and easy to carry.  \nI found this laptop on Lenovo's website -¬†[Link](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-s-series/lenovo-ideapad-slim-5-gen-10-13-inch-amd/83j2cto1wwin1)\n\nBut, i found no reviews of it on youtube or any other place. If there anyone who can help me out with this?  \nI know the laptop is good in specs, but i don't have any idea about the battery life, cooling efficiency and any other things which i might have missed.",
  "Need a system for productivity, VM work, and light gaming with good battery I get into a lot of network simulation like GNS3 and EveNG to run network devices and systems VMs. I also am taking some online ethical hacking courses that uses a lot of VMs for Linux and windows. I don‚Äôt like staying plugged in all the time, so I‚Äôm trying to find a good mix.\n\nLast year i bought the Yoga Slim 9i 16‚Äù and it was fantastic except the battery. That was a joke. It would die with casual use within 2-3 hours or less, and that was with me turning down settings and going to 60hz. If that‚Äôs how it needs to be used, what‚Äôs the point of all the extra power and features? So I sold it. My 15‚Äù MacBook Air M2 has been working out for productivity, but I really need a Windows system back for my VM and simulation stuff. I also miss gaming a little here and there. \n\nI am just not sure what will end up being more important to me feature wise (screen, weight, battery, dGPU etc). I am looking at three systems and leaning towards AMD for battery life, but the Core Ultra 9 185h has more cores for VM work and seems to do ok on battery depending on the system. I also love a good screen, but I don‚Äôt do a lot of media consumption really. I don‚Äôt know I will actually take advantage of miniLED/OLED or not.\n\nThree systems:\nLenovo Yoga Pro 9 w/o miniLED 32Gb, Intel 185H, 4050 (IPS version is on sale for 1299 at Best Buy. The miniLED version is $600 more because it isn‚Äôt on sale, and that‚Äôs too much extra)\nLenovo Thinkpad P16s Gen 2 w/ 7840u, 64gb ram, 1tb SSD, 4k OLED 60hz New in Box for $910 (AMD does ok casual gaming, so no dGPU is ok but I kinda prefer one)\nLenovo Ideapad Pro 5 w/ Intel Ultra 9 185H, 32Gb ram, 4050, 2k OLED 120hz refurbished for $850. (Has mixed reviews and a loud track which can annoy me)\n\nI am also trying to stick to under $1500.\n\nIf anybody else knows of something, my needs are:\n16‚Äù Nice screen w/ higher resolution (doesn‚Äôt have to be 4k) don‚Äôt care about high refresh rate on laptops. I‚Äôve had it, and it didn‚Äôt much for me.\n32-64GB of ram (VMs take up a lot of ram)\nMany CORES (Ultra 9 has more than 8840U or HS, but not sure how much that will impact VM use)\nGood battery life without having to make it feel like a $300 laptop in features.\nNumberpad - Inputting IP address on a top row of keys is horrible. I have to do that some when i work remote for my job since my work laptop is 14‚Äù\n\nThere are a ton of options that fit all of this except battery life. It sucks to constantly worry about plugging in to keep working. I wanted the new Ryzen Ai 370 but there are no systems that meet my criteria except one new MSi system that is priced too high for the specs. I wish I didn‚Äôt want the numpad, but I really need it.\n",
  "Looking for a laptop ideal for university. Would this be a good deal? Hi y'all and sorry for the question, you must be getting the \"Is this good?\" type of posts daily.\n\nI'm looking for a laptop for university. Something on the lighter side with good battery life that can still play the odd game here and there.\n\nI found a good deal (I think) on a Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5 that's on sale right now. The laptop itself is the 16AHP9.\n\nIt has a Ryzen 7 8845HS, Radeon 780M Igpu, 32gb of RAM, 1Tb M.2 SSD and a 16\" 2048x1280 120hz OLED screen. It's 700 EUR brand new which for Europe feels like a good deal to me.\n\nFrom the small amount of reviews it has, people seem really happy.\n\nWhat do you guys think?"
