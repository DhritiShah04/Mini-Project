  "Should I go with Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 or save for something better? Hi! I'm planning to buy a laptop for university, I'm studying software engineering. I’ve looked into several options, and the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 seems like the best choice in that price range. I’m interested in hearing about other people’s experiences with this laptop: how is the battery life, is it fast enough? The screen has an IPS panel, so I don’t think it's too bad in that regard. I need the laptop mainly for studying and everyday tasks, and it's important to me that it lasts for 4–5 years. Do you think this laptop is good enough, or should I consider some slightly better and more expensive options? Thanks in advance!",
  "I wouldn't buy this laptop as it's 2 major generations old. Look for something newer.\n\nCheck what the specifications of the IPS is. If it's 45% ntsc, then it's trash. The colors can be insanely dull.",
  "This laptop likely won't last that long, it's already a ~4 years old model and it's one of the cheaper ones in terms of build quality. \n\nSave for a more mid-range to high-end laptop with a metal chassis, and one that's modern. Getting 4-5 years out of any laptop is pretty hard without REALLY taking care of it.",
  "Which laptop have you purchased?",
  "i bought the snapdragon version hoping for good battery + speed. instead, what i got - overheating, lag under normal workloads, snapdragon throttling under load, battery dying way faster than promised.",
  "The Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 feels basic and underwhelming. Its plastic build rattles, and the fan noise is annoying even on battery. The screen is okay but nothing special, and the outdated Intel processor struggles with multitasking and gaming. Slow Wi-Fi and limited ports only add to the frustration. For the price, it feels like too many compromises were made, making it a tough recommendation. If you want a budget laptop, there are better options out there that don’t feel this sluggish or cheap. Definitely not a laptop I’d want to rely on daily.",
  "Yes, the screen is 45% NTSC, but I don’t pay too much attention to that because of my limited budget. What matters more to me is that it has good memory and a good processor. The other laptops I’ve looked at in this price range have TN screens, which are much worse.",
  "Thanks, I'll check out something else then.",
  "I bought a used Lenovo ThinkPad L13 Gen2 with an Intel i5, and so far I’m satisfied with it",
  "What would you recommend around the same price point?",
  "It's difficult to choose then. If you're fine with the screens, then go for it. My only issue is that the processor is old and you want it for the next 4-5 years. Does it have 16GB RAM?",
  "Hi, have you found a better one? I also need a laptop for uni.",
  "Yes, it have 16GB RAM. Which processor would you recommend then?",
  "I decided to get a used ThinkPad L13 Gen2",
  "A newer model of the same CPU. Ryzen 7 6800u or Ryzen 7 7730u. In Intel, i5 1235U, i7 1255U, i5 1335U, i7 1355U.",
  "Thank you",
  "Hi what do you think of this one: Laptop LENOVO ThinkPad E16 21JN0008SC / Core i5 1335U, 16GB, 512 GB SSD, Intel HD Graphics, 16\" FHD IPS ?\n\nI need it for uni for light programming and i want it to last 4-5 years. Also if you can reccomend other ones if this one isnt good, my budget is 500-800€.",
  "This would be nice laptop for your use.",
  "How is lenovo Ideapad slim 5 Ryzen 7 7735HS. If anyone have this laptop i really wanna know the reviews. Nd battery too.",
  "FIrst and foremost doubt. Why is the title and description says 7735HS and the options below says 7735U?\n\nBoth of them are good performers. If we go to specifics, both have same cores and threads, 95% details are same between those twooo.\n\nThe only difference is:\n\n* **7735HS** is 15% better in multi-core performance than 7735U. HS is 15% better in performance than U.\n* **7735U** has better performance per watt, meaning slightly higher battery power than 7735HS. U has better efficency than HS (maybe like 10mins more depending on the usage).\n\nMake sure you are getting the model that you are looking for. The seller might have done the incorrect information, but just to make sure you are getting the same contact with them and confirm once. Just a precautionary.\n\n**Disclaimer:** These are rough calculations.",
  "I prefer to buy from lenovo official website , you get a 3000₹ off on a offer called after10deal it applys after 10 pm and if you use credit card 3000₹ off further,  finally it will be around 56,000₹\n\nIt has a 70Whr battery 100% SRGB display and its 15 inch version  \n\n\nhttps://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-s-series/lenovo-ideapad-slim-5-gen-10-15-inch-amd/83j3003sin",
  "Yes I know this much about it. I'm asking if this is a good option or not?",
  "Fine but I don't want soldered ram does it come in SoDIMM?",
  "Yes yes, OP. Its really a good laptop and your choice.\n\nBattery Life of **Ideapad 8-11Hrs** as per various sources, thats an average. Some even got 12hrs with single charge.\n\nIf you dont mind me saying this, I have the same brand and processor in my notepad list and its only 56K from direct Lenovo site.

  "Coding, little gaming and vdo editing. \nI'm a cs major student",
  "I promise you, when I first saw this laptop model 5 months ago. Its have very good battery and overall quality. Then, after 2 months I am seeing build quality is not good and its between Ideapad & ThinkPad quality.\n\nBut, seeing its battery capacity as 45Wh, no wonder it has low battery backup.

  "if theyre light games, then yes it is all good",
  "But this also has just 47wh \nI saw this https://share.google/4MdWRKCVp33Zjj2Na\n\nWhich 70wh it goes to 57k sometimes  but I searched everywhere but no review on this specific laptop",
  "I mean gta v for short time",
  "Can I use it for light 2d works? Not heavy ones",
  "So, I was scrolling randomly and saw someone asked for the same thinkbook review. One of the commenters mentioned it was shit...\n\nThey said this: The camera is really bad. Everything else seems to work fine. The battery is small though. 45Wh only (I get around 3.5 - 4hrs of battery under light usage). You can try for IdeaPad slim 3 with r7 8840HS. It has a 60Wh battery. Or IdeaPad slim 5 gen 10 with ai 7 350. The processor and battery combination in this one is deadly (and so is the price). 55k\n\nI think this would help you in picking up a good battery life laptop hopefully.",
  "yes, it should be sufficient",
  "Thank you",
  "Lenovo Ideapad slim 3 gen 10 AMD 14\" So i bought this laptop for £469 in the UK for university and i have had it for about a week now and I have not seen any reviews so i thought i would leave a review. It has a ryzen 5 8640hs with integrated radeon graphics, 16gb ram dual channel and a 60wh battery\n\nBuild quality: This laptop is made of sturdy plastic, the finish feels very nice but it is nothing to boast about, it is good enough for the price. I like how it is very lightweight and is really easy to carry around.\n\nDisplay: The anti-glare coating is great for this and really helps when it is sunny outside and the sun is very bright. 1920x1200 is very sharp but other than that its a regular 60hz IPS panel but it definitely gets the job done.\n\nKeyboard: This one does not come with a full size keyboard but I am not too bothered by this personally as I dont usually use the rest of the other keys. Sometimes I do press the wrong keys but once you get used to it, its a solid keyboard.\n\nPerformance: The CPU in this is very fast, whatever I do happens in an instant whether im video editing, watching videos, playing games or in a meeting. The 16gb ram also plays a huge role in this. What surprised me the most was the performance of the GPU considering its only 15W. I dont play very heavy games but this GPU was able to run forza horizon 4, fortnite, GTA, battlefield 1 and hollow Knight at good fps(these are the games I usually play). I also did some wii u emulation and it was flawless. One thing I will mention is that the laptop can be quite noisy when gaming on extreme performance mode but is very quiet when not being pushed.\n\nBattery: The battery on this is great for what it is. I was able to achieve around 7-8 hours from 100 percent to 20 whilst just doing my assignments(on battery saver). I got around 5-6 hours on netflix. When gaming the max i got was around 3 hours of battery life which is not too bad.",
  "wow thanks for this review! I was thinking of getting this laptops but couldn't find a lot of reviews so thanks <3",
  "Nice review, I just bought the version with AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS with dual RAM of 8 GB each. I hope I don't regret it, but the price of €630 seemed very advantageous to me honestly",
  "How good an idea is it to get this same version but with 24GB of RAM for $800? Considering that I live in Chile and our prices tend to be higher than those in first-world countries.",
  "Hi! Thanks for the review. Do you think it's worth getting the Ryzen 78840HS version for 40€ more?? I'm gonna be using it for university work. Music production software and other music related software and some gaming",
  "Hi, I am interested of this Laptop, i.e. the 8840HS variant, supports DP alt mode 1.4 on the USB-C port.",
  "I know it's an old post but how is the laptop holding up so far ?",
  "Hi I’ve had this laptop for over a month now and it’s been pretty good thus far but have a few issues/concerns and wanted to see if others are having! 1. The trackpad is not good my fingers dont move on it well and it doesn’t feel sturdy it feels pretty cheap. 2. I might of banged it at some stage but I noticed with the display when it shows black things the pixels are blue in a certain spot only a little you can barely notice it but it bothers me.",
  "No problem its a great laptop for its price, still going strong right now",
  "How is the battery?",
  "As far as I'm aware the \"24GB\" version doesn't exist, it can just support up to 24GB, as in you need to buy extra memory and install it yourself. If that's 800USD that's a disgusting price. Are Apple products also more expensive there? Personally I'd be looking into an Air M4 for that price.",
  "Dont get it, its not worth it at that price point",
  "Absolutely, that ryzen 7 is quite a bit faster and will be better for running multiple tasks, the igpu on it is slightly faster than the ryzen 5 one by about 10%. For €40 more yeah i would say its worth it",
  "Cant really say but its most likely similar to this one but with a stronger gpu and cpu",
  "Its holding up great the battery and performance is still good",
  "In reality it has yet to arrive, they're taking a long time to ship and maybe I'm changing my mind, opting for a thinkpad for €100 more though",
  "Hi, this I assume. Does your model support DP Alt Mode 1.4?",
  "I can buy the slim 3, witht he ryzen 7 only 16gb ram and 60Wh battery for £466, worth ?",
  "ciao, potresti fare un aggiornamento? quale PC hai preso alla fine? a che thinkpad stavi pensando? ti trovi bene?",
  "Whats that",
  "Yeah thats worth it",

  "Bought the Snapdragon X Plus variant of the Ideapad Slim 5 for ₹56K—Here’s My Review ",
  "# My Experience (1 Week of Use)\n\nSetting up my workflow was a breeze. I’ve built projects using **Go and Docker**—no issues at all. Also used it for **note-taking, reading/editing PDFs, watching movies, and listening to music**.\n\nFor the past few days, it hasn't stuttered a bit while running the following **simultaneously for 4-5 hours**:\n\n* **WSL** (running Zellij & Neovim)\n* **Zen browser**\n* **Obsidian**\n* **Docker container**\n* **Syncthing**\n* **WhatsApp**\n* **Discord**\n* ...and much more\n\nI rarely shut down my device (only for updates/restarts), and **it loses just \\~2% charge in sleep mode**. The efficiency of this chip blows my mind.\n\nCompared to Intel & Ryzen laptops at this price, **battery life is unmatched, and performance is either on par or better**.\n\nAll my tools and applications are natively supported, **except Quick Share, which runs fine under emulation**. Also, the **Android-Windows ecosystem is seamless**, and I love it.\n\n#",
  "Got the same laptop and trackpad died within 2 months. Good luck.",
  "I watched a review of similar one from HP half a year ago and it was good only in native ARM apps, for x86 apps it was terrible, emulation did not work as smooth as on Macs. Have you tried x86 apps or they managed to rebuild everything into ARM during last 6 months?",
  "Does it support Hyper-V? If so, can it run X86 guests?",
  "Please provide a link how did  you get it for less",
  "Would you recommend it to a mobile and web developer? I'm using software like visual studio and android studio. Also laravel for some web dev.",
  "mate how is it for learning programming languages, and please share your experience with Python and data analytics software.",
  "# Downsides & Limitations\n\nOf course, nothing is perfect, so here are some quirks I found:\n\n* **No proper Android drivers** – I tried installing a custom ROM via `fastboot`, but the device didn’t show up. No solution yet.\n* **Android development on ARM is still rough** – It’ll take time before things become fully native.\n* **No OS change option** – Coming from Linux, this was frustrating. Snapdragon promised proper Linux support, but that still seems far away. That said, **WSL has been a lifesaver**, and Windows has been surprisingly pleasant for my use case.\n* **Gaming is not natively supported** – I don’t game, but knowing that most games won’t run natively is still a con. Hopefully, ARM gaming support improves.\n\nHonestly, the **biggest con I expected was Windows itself**—I assumed it would be painful after using Linux. But there are **great alternatives for most tools**, and I’ve actually been enjoying Windows. Didn’t think I’d ever say that!\n\n# Final Verdict\n\nFor ₹56K, this laptop is **an absolute steal**. It’s **comparable to a MacBook Air in build quality, performance, and battery life**—but with **more RAM & storage**. I’m really happy with my purchase.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask! 🚀",
  "I just purchased this one for 29k with a 22k exchange on the old laptop. The Original price was around 51k RN....\n\nI bought this for my brother; he's about to start his master's, and he needs a good device to do and write some research papers. Most of the software he might be using is MS Office, zoom/teams for meetings, and mainly a browser for multimedia and all of his stuff. \n\nAnd while this one is giving unmatched battery life without a charger and no lag, while being the same or more powerful than other i5/i7 12th gen devices, i was checking in the 40-50k price range. So this is where my search ends up... now i'm glad that you liked it, and it's good enough for a student to do basic stuff and multimedia.",
  "Did you suggest this laptop for devops",
  "sad to hear that, hope the warranty fixes it",
  "I use everything on native arm version. The only apps that i ran on x86 are obs and quick share but they ran so smooth and didn't cause any error or problem. The emulaor is good and programs will not feel different until you check on task manager.  \ni accidently downloaded and ran the x86 version of slack, and didn't even felt it being emulated until yesterday when i noticed a program on x86 on task manager",
  "x86 app runs but never tried games. How to check hyper-v support",
  "I ordered in Flipkart (india) where it was 61k and then extra 5000 credit card discount",
  "python works and also has arm version , i think no problem should occur but do check specific software in the woa website",
  "All major programming languages has binaries available for windows arm64 . The only issue I faced is that some older python packages wheels are not available for windows arm64 for eg. scipy , pygit2 etc.\n\nBut I still love it I can use wsl . Got it for 61k (bcz don't have a icci credit card). Battery life is amazing, u can carry it very easily in a bag . Also the charger is very compact u can use ur phone charger to charge it",
  "Gaming support is mostly a problem due to anti cheat and it's kernel level nature. Games that dont require it work surprisingly well, I saw horizon zero dawn run very playable on a SD X elite laptop.",
  "still nah for me, since still doesn't support Linux, you could say use wsl the issue it uses a lot of ram. btw there is a Ubuntu arm version u could try it and tell us the result ? u can dual boot",
  "what about the display ? Isnt it too dim ? It seems ips panel has only 300 nits",
  "I recently used this for learning kubernetes. kubectl  worked fine in wsl. Docker ran without any issue with 6 pods, while staying silent and not heating at all  \nThat being said you should check if all of your tool have native support, otherwise it works like a charm  \nEdit- repeated phrase",
  "The last documentation I saw was that you need to have Windows 11 Pro version for Hyper-V then you can enable it in the settings. Then you can only run ARM64 guests not x86 but that's my memory recalled from the time that these Snapdragon Windows laptops were released. IDK how much improvements they added today.",
  "oh  that's assuring to hear. May be i will play some in future",
  "I haven't looked since launch but it sounded like these laptops were similar to phones you need a new build for each laptop. \n\nThat may have changed. I dunno, from reports Microsoft was helping fund these processors with rebates. \n\nThe next line are targeting $600> laptops so should be better value. Hopefully they fix the Linux issues.",
  "I will do it but the guide is for snapdragon X elite only till now so am waiting till proper guide",
  "i think it's ample for inside , outdoors would be  a problem in a sunny day but that is a rare situation for me",

  "Review of Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 (15in, 16gb, 512gb SSD, AMD Ryzen 5700u) I bought the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 (15in, 16gb, 512gb SSD, AMD Ryzen 5700u) in India. Here is my review about it after using it for about 2 weeks.\n\n**Build:**\n\n* Update after 14 months (16 Oct 2022): Shit quality hinge. Broke twice till now without ever dropping the laptop.\n* Full plastic build. Metal Lid. Matte finish. Feels great and solid.\n* Keyboard and touchpad are great\n\n**General things:**\n\n1. Initially I had some problem with the speakers when they would stop working and I had to restart the laptop to fix. I got a driver update a couple days later, haven't had that same problem since.\n2. The fingerprint can be a hit or miss sometimes due to its design, I then added my fingerprint from multiple angles so mostly works but sometimes have to try again.\n3. My unit had some backlight bleed on the bottom right corner noticeable when in a dimly lit room at above 70% brightness. Not a problem for me since I dim the screen to around 30% in the dark. This will vary by laptop though.\n4. I have a problem with OBS recordings. It seems that OBS is recording at same volume as windows master volume. I haven't been able to find a fix for it. Every program I tried which captures audio from speakers to record/broadcast (OBS, XSlit, Anydesk) have the same issue.  **(EDIT: FIX: Roll Back Realtek (R) Audio drivers so that the manufacturer is Microsoft, Dolby audio will stop working though if you do it. Not recommended.)**\n5. The product description states that it has Bluetooth 5.0 but the device manager says its Bluetooth 5.1.\n\n**Expandability**:\n\nI opened mine up coz of curiosity. The internal design is the same as last years version.\n\n1. The RAM is soldered in dual channel. (Task Manager)\n2. There is one M.2 NVME SSD slot which is already populated with the 512 GB SSD.\n3. There is a space for an HDD but it doesn't come with the SATA cable installed, the SATA cable will need to be purchased separately to install a hard drive within the laptop.\n4. The laptop comes with WI-FI 5 and not WI-FI 6 unlike last years version. The WI-FI card is upgradable if you need WIFI 6.\n5. The internal battery can also be upgraded to 70 Whrs version. However note that if you do upgrade, it will occupy the HDD slot aswell.\n\nLink to Lenovo's Spare parts website of this model. [IdeaPad 5 ALC05 Type 92LN Spare parts](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/in/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/5-series/ideapad-5-15alc05/82ln/parts/display/compatible)\n\n**Battery life estimates from 100 percent battery (70% brightness):**\n\n1. Watching movies (Chrome with 5 extensions - 1 tab open, discord, telegram, anydesk, Battery saving mode active from Vantage software, Better battery saving mode in windows.) - 9hrs\n2. Moderate Multi tasking (Listening to music, actually using chrome, discord, qbittorrent (downloading) and a bunch of other background programs, Battery saving mode from Vantage software, Better battery saving mode in windows.) - 6 to 7 hrs\n\n* Note: I use my laptop on conservation mode all the time so it charges only to 60%. The battery life is based on the time it take to drain the laptop from 60% to around 30% and multiplying that by 3.\n* The conservation mode is not customizable. Its either 60% charge or 100% charge.\n* Also, I absolutely love the conservation mode, ~~no other brands have this~~ Asus and Dell also have it according to the internet. My laptop remains on the desk most of the time so I don't have to worry about it remaining on 100% all the time.\n\n**Fans (In an air conditioned room)**\n\n* On Battery- The laptop fans are completely off when watching movies. They may or may not turn on when multi tasking.\n* Plugged in- The fans only turned off when set to Battery Saving Mode in Vantage and doing light tasks.\n* Fans are inaudible (if they do turn on) when doing basic tasks in a room with air conditioner running, only slightly audible with the air conditioner off.\n\n**iGPU**:\n\n* Out of the 16gb ram, 2GB is dedicated for the iGPU, this can be changed in BIOS to 1GB or 512 MB.\n\n**Lenovo Power Management modes:**\n\n* Extreme Performance- TDP is 35 Watts.\n* Intelligent Cooling- TDP is 25 Watts.\n* Battery Saving Mode- TDP is 15 Watts.\n* On Battery, change to best performance (windows) and these modes function the same as plugged in.  I did notice that Battery Saver Mode (Vantage) turns on the fans later than the Intelligent cooling mode which is I guess nice if you're trying to save battery.\n\n**Performance Benchmarks (Plugged in)(Extreme Performance):**\n\n* **Cinnebench R23**\n   * Multi Core **-** 9655 points, 3.65 GHz across all cores, Max: 85 C, Power: 35 W\n   * Single Core **-** 1245 points, 4.3 Ghz single core, Max: 70 C, Power: 10 W\n* **Crystal DiskMark-** 2481 MB/s Read, 1726 MB/s Write\n\n**Performance Benchmarks on battery:**\n\nThe laptop can achieve full performance on battery as well, change from Better Battery mode to Best performance mode in the Windows battery settings.\n\n**Note:** On battery, Better Battery (and Battery Saver) mode locks the CPU at base clock of 1.8 Ghz to get maximum battery life. While using this mode, I did not suffer any hanging when doing casual tasks, (Web browsing, YouTube, Discord etc.)\n\nIf you wanna know something else about it. Please let me know.

This has not been fixed after a touchpad replacement so currently working on it. The issue does seem isolated to just me though.\n* Edit #6: Update as of 16 Oct 2022: The hinge is shit quality, it has broken twice till now in the exact same manner with completely normal use.",
  "I can confirm that the hinge quality is garbage. I use mine almost entirely at home, after 2 years of use I have used it no more than 30 times outside. I very rarely open and close the lid when I use it at home because I can sense right from the beginning the hinge quality is not the best although I did not expect it to be this bad. And yet the hinge broke! Together with the LCD!\n\nI paid RM170 (around 39 USD) just to get the one time on site repair because they said repair at the depot would take around 2 weeks time and I had no spare laptop. The basic, send in to the depot warranty covered the spare parts, luckily. So if you guys are planning to buy this model, **do consider to upgrade to the onsite warranty to 3 or 4 years** (depending on how long you plan to use the device). \n\nThe technician who came even told me this model and the model 3 are plagued with this problem. 7 and thinkpads fair better. I wish I'd known.\n\nPerformance wise, it is amazing. Still running strong after two years. (I open many tabs on Edge daily, at times 30-50 tabs, rarely any hiccup.) i5 11 gen, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Heat management is superb as well. It heats up but never overheat, not once.\n\nCheers,  \nR.",
  "Thank you for the review! This is by far the most comprehensive one I've read about this laptop as it's just been released.\n\nI have a few questions-\n1. Do you notice a significant drop in performance (general multi tasking) when on battery vs plugged in?\n2. Does the 100% screen brightness hold up in well-lit rooms or under the sun?\n3. How was the initial set-up process like? Did you install any specific programs/drivers that helped?",
  "Thankx for the review, based on it I will no more 'struggle' with choosing a new laptop from Lenovo, I got a bit scared haha. I'm gonna carry on with my HP's. They have not failed me yet, and I have been happy with performances so far. :)",
  "**Beware: Major Touchpad Problem**\n\nI bought a Lenovo Ideapad Silm 5 laptop in Aug 23, and I thought all is well until a few months in. My touchpad stopped functioning but thankfully, the onsite warranty allowed me to change my motherboard. A few months down the road, the same issue arose, and I was told by the customer hotline to undergo numerous upgrading of software, restarting of laptop, etc, and the touchpad would mysteriously function after a months/weeks until it breaks down again. This laptop is reaching its 1 year mark, and the same issue still persists. It has been a major inconvenience, especially since a mouse cannot entirely replace the functions of the touchpad (i.e. pinching in/out to enlarge the text). To my dismay, I was told by the onsite warranty engineer that the touchpad issue is rampant in laptops of this particular model. I asked for an upgrade of my laptop or replacement of another model, but I was told that this was not Lenovo's usual practice. Am still monitoring the issue after the engineer has replaced the touchpad (for second time), but if anything, **please do not purchase this model** unless you are willing to forgo its touchpad.\n\nTrust me, their onsite warranty they provide is not worth in exchange for your sanity if you were to constantly experience the same issue. The warranty team somehow does not understand what \"intermittent issue\" mean, and they'll put you through the arduous process of troubleshooting and restarting, only for you to find yourself back to square one.\n\nP.S. My USB ports were also not working, but it's fixed atm.",

  "Why, kind sir, did you decide on the 15 in version instead of the 14 in? Was there any other reason than personal preference?",
  "Omg, Thank You soo much for posting this review!!\n\n\nI am unable to decide between this Ideapad and the Legion 5 with 4600H as both are very similarly priced. \n\nCould you tell me what price did you buy this at? Cause right now, it is 68k INR. And is it worth the price?\n\n\nHow is the cooling on this laptop? Does it heat up under medium-heavy loads? Especially without air conditioning.\n\n\nDoes it stutter or lag a bit when you launch an app or open a web browser or type? Especially when on battery?\n\n\n\nI tried the Intel model for the Ideapad which apparently uses the same body and parts as the Ryzen 5700U model. I did not find the keyboard and the touchpad as good as I was expecting (but I could be wrong cause I only tried it for a few seconds). \n\n\nIs the battery replaceable/ easily removeable by the user? Or does one have to take it to a service center?\n\nI was also considering the HP laptops with Ryzen 5500U but the 15in (my preferred screen size) has a TN panel while the 14in does have IPS but is glossy (I need antiglare so it doesn't strain my eyes).\n\n\nThe Ideapad 5 and Legion 5 just seem so much better.",

I'm looking for an offline store to pick it up but just can't find it anywhere. \n\nAlso, now that it's been like 70 days since the post, how's the laptop holding up?

  "Valuable information my friend, I have a similar laptop but the Pro series. Would I see a major difference in battery drain and temperature, if I turn on Extreme Performance in BIOS but Balanced mode on Windows?\n\nAlso, does it make any sense to do this for gaming purposes? Because if you're going to play while the system is AC wired the TDP would be higher than 25W anyways, am I right?",

  "Hi,\n\n1. The performance drop is not noticeable doing casual tasks on battery vs plugged in. Tried loading web pages and video playback. 4k60fps video playback is smooth on both. \n2. 100% screen brightness definitely holds up in a well lit room, I cam easily manage at 70% brightness in my room. This is probably the best you'll get in this price range, most competition only offer 250 nit screens while this is a 300 nit screen.\n3. Set-up process is pretty classic for windows. The only bloatware was McAfee which I promptly uninstalled. I found once that Lenovo Voice assistant was using 50% of the CPU (it may be updating), so uninstalled that as well. As for driver updates, Lenovo Vantage software is great, check for system updates and install the updated audio drivers from there.",

  "IdeaPad 5 is still a good option for 68k. \n\nApart from this, Asus K15 Oled with 5500U, 8GB seems like a sweet deal at 58k on Flipkart during sale. Downsides would be 8Gb of RAM and a 42Whr battery. The ram is expandable to maximum of 12 or 16 gb idk. If you can look past the smaller battery, it has a freaking Oled. You might be able to get some extra battery life by using dark mode because of the Oled display.",
  "No need to go into BIOS to change performance mode, you can just change them from within windows with Lenovo Vantage. Or press Fn+Q\n\n***About the second question:-***      \nWhile AC is connected windows power modes don't really do much so you can ignore them. Between the three windows power modes there is very little difference in terms of CPU power usage (maybe 1W difference between each mode).\n\nBIOS performance modes behave exactly the same both on battery and AC. Which means TDP limits will be the same on both AC and battery. Which means if the game demands more than 25W sustained power, Intelligent cooling mode will limit performance.\n\n***About the first question:***\n\n**Under low load:-**   \nThe difference in battery life will only be caused by the fact that extreme performance mode likes to enable the fans even under very light load.\n\n**Under moderate load:-**    \nThere should be no difference for battery life and heat output in between the different BIOS power modes or windows power modes.\n\nThe reason why low and moderate load don't cause significant differences in battery life between the different power modes because the CPU only uses as much power as it needs, it is not going to consume more power if the program itself doesn't require it.\n\n**For heavy load:**\n\n**If using better battery mode (windows):**    \nThere should again be no difference in between any of the BIOS power modes.\n\n**If using better performance or best performance mode (windows):**     \nThere will be lesser battery life and greater heat output in Intelligent cooling mode compared to Battery saving mode. The difference would be greater in Extreme performance mode. However, you will also be getting better performance.",

  "Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5i VS Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 I got 2 laptops from Lenovo on sale to compare them before deciding which to get.\n\nIdeaPad Slim 5i: 646$ after tax\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS w/ Radeon 780M Graphics 3.8 GHz\n\nYoga Slim 7: 1046$ after tax\n\n* Intel Core Ultra 7 256V 2.20GHz w/ Intel Arc 140V GPU (8GB)\n\n  \nFrom all the reviews of the Yoga Slim 7, I've seen that the iGPU for the Ultra 7 256V (Intel Arc 140V) should be a great one and a much better improvement on previous iGPUs. They also run games on it and it works pretty well (but they usually use the 258V which has the same GPU).\n\nFrom testing however, I found that the AMD one is performing much better. I'm using Fortnite as a comparison/reference: AMD was able to run smoothly with Medium preset settings while the Intel one quite literally blue screened me and crashed the laptop twice. Eventually I got it to work, but at less than 30fps while the AMD one held \\~60fps or more.

Is this something with the settings or drivers (I updated all drivers)? I made sure both screens had the same refresh rate and resolution for a fair comparison too. Both laptops' battery lives are equivalent and the only difference between the two is that the Yoga has a really good display. I'm kinda lost here.

Please feel free to ask me any questions.\n\nTL;DR: It seems like the ultimate midrange laptop would be a Lenovo Ideapad Slim 7 with a 4800U processor and a good anti-glare display - let's hope it's released broadly soon!\n\n# Laptop Specs\n\n|Laptop Model|Dell Latitude 6430u|Acer Aspire 5 15.6\" A515-54G-53H6|Lenovo Ideapad Slim 7 15\" 15IIL05|Lenovo Ideapad 5 14\" 14ARE05|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Retail Price|$1,300|$650|$1,200|$860|\n|Purchased Price (w/ coupons, cashback, excl. tax)|$1,300|$650|$840|$700|\n|Processor|Intel i5-3427U|Intel i5-10210U|Intel i7-1065G7|AMD Ryzen 7 4700U|\n|Graphics|Integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000|Integrated Intel Graphics + NVIDIA GeForce MX250|Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics|AMD Radeon Graphics (Vega 7)|\n|RAM|4 GB DDR3|8 GB DDR4|16 GB LPDDR4X|16 GB DDR4|\n|Storage|256 GB SSD|512 GB SSD|512 GB SSD|512 GB SSD|\n|Display|14\" 1366x768, 200 nits, 55% sRGB, anti-glare|15.6\" 1920x1080, 300 nits, 51% sRGB, anti-glare|15.6\" 1920x1080, 300 nits, 100% sRGB, glossy|14\" 1920x1080, 300 nits, 60% sRGB, anti-glare|\n|Connectivity|802.11 g/n|Wifi 6 + Bluetooth 5.0|Wifi 6 + Bluetooth 5.0|Wifi 6 + Bluetooth 5.0|\n|Battery Capacity (Wh)|60|48|71|57|\n|Weight (lbs)|3.7|3.8|4.1|3.1|\n\n# Performance Benchmarks\n\nI ran some benchmark tests on each laptop and have indexed the scores to the Acer Aspire 5 performance below. All laptops were running minimal background programs, plugged in, and set to the 'Best Performance' Windows power mode. I haven't adjusted any TDP settings or undervolted anything.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 4700U and i7-1065G7 both crush multi-core tasks compared to the entry-level 10th gen i5.  While 4700U single-core performance is very comparable across the three latest chips, it is an undisputed winner in multi-core tests. It's crazy how far computing power has come - the 4700U is over 5x as fast as the old i5-3427U!\n\n[CPU Benchmark Scores](https://preview.redd.it/tnx8rsmhjl151.png?width=1089&format=png&auto=webp&s=473ac2c5dbc977afb15c8cdfe549f9308b04bafd)\n\nI ran Cinebench R20 multi-core tests back-to-back to get a sense of the steady state output. The 4700U does drop 16% from a peak score of 3189 but still has over a 50% edge on the i7-1065G7.\n\n[Cinebench R20 Multi-Core Runs in a loop](https://preview.redd.it/90ylvczjjl151.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=2797a6c4c5dd8e5b7f2f44b330db09637e9d70fe)\n\nThe integrated Radeon graphics on the Ryzen 7 4700U is supposedly Vega 7, but I didn't see that specified anywhere. Nevertheless, this was a comparison I was excited to do because of the curiosity around how the Radeon graphics stack up to Ice Lake and separately a dedicated entry-level NVIDIA MX250.\n\n[GPU Benchmark Scores](https://preview.redd.it/qwvzaoomjl151.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c6051fc635579017d31e0ede02ce0be0f562770)\n\nLastly, I used Novabench to gauge speeds on the RAM and disk. It seems like the Slim 7 has the more premium configuration and parts (LPDDR4X at higher MHz).\n\n[RAM + Disk Benchmark Scores](https://preview.redd.it/yu56pbdojl151.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=77982e67ac1b50499c63548ca0b37aaf74894f56)\n\n# Ideapad Slim 7 vs. 5 Display Comparison\n\nInitial reviews of the Ideapad Slim 5 have been largely positive other than the display quality and brightness. I don't consider display brightness an important factor as I typically work on the lowest brightness settings all the time. However, I was curious to see the difference between 60% sRGB and 100% sRGB because I do video/photo editing from time to time.\n\nBelow are a few comparisons of the Ideapad 5 (left) and Ideapad Slim 7 (right) screens at max and min brightness. Having used each device for a couple days, I do appreciate the color accuracy of the Slim 7 a lot, but I prefer having an anti-glare screen over a glossy one.\n\n[Ideapad 5 \\(left\\) vs. Ideapad Slim 7 \\(right\\) in the desktop view at max brightness](https://preview.redd.it/bluvfvzrjl151.png?width=2568&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ff576eea4dc66a8532f9e1fb3d39498dba9d5b4)\n\n[Ideapad 5 \\(left\\) vs. Ideapad Slim 7 \\(right\\) with a random picture at max brightness](https://preview.redd.it/95gnxayvjl151.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7eaf22d5060bd69a5dc0baccdc8c0d10ed832d)\n\n[Ideapad 5 \\(left\\) vs. Ideapad Slim 7 \\(right\\) with a random picture at min brightness](https://preview.redd.it/ucmlu9dyjl151.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e688ef20e4dcce8628ad85cabc7ea3b6f725ade)\n\n# Other Thoughts\n\n**Acer Aspire 5**\n\nThe A515-54G-53H6 felt like a decent deal for the price and specs. Supposedly, I could have upgraded the RAM from 2x4 GB to 20 GB, but I never opened up the internals. The fan was surprisingly loud during idle and web browsing, and the battery life of 7-8 hrs on idle definitely left more to be desired. The dimensions felt a bit large for a 15.6\" and the construction felt ok, just not super solid.\n\n**Lenovo Ideapad Slim 7**\n\nThis felt like a premium laptop right away. The fan came on during light games and benchmarking, but didn't seem too loud in a quiet room. The two USB-Cs + Thunderbolt 3 are definitely a great feature and left me spoiled once I received the Ideapad 5. The laptop did feel a bit heavy at 4.1 lbs and the nice metal finish seemed to scratch easily, although you can buff out minor ones.\n\nI would have kept this machine if it had an anti-glare screen and if there weren't a substantial price difference vs. the Ideapad 5. I don't think I would notice 4700U vs. i7-1065G7 performance differences in real world use that much.\n\n**Lenovo Ideapad 5**\n\nAfter using the Slim 7, this laptop felt like more of a budget choice. The bezels aren't as razor thin and elegantly trimmed. The trackpad has a greater click depression that makes it feel cheaper. Otherwise, as other reviews have mentioned, the build quality is surprisingly good. I'm perfectly happy with this given the effective price that I got it at. I also prefer the portability of the 14\" over premium features such as an IR camera. This is a strong upgrade over my Dell Latitude 6430u and I would be happy to keep this for the next few years!",
  "The Ideapad Slim 7 looks good! But it would much better with the Ryzen 7 4700U from the Ideapad 5",
  "Thank you for this post!",
  "Does the IdeaPad Slim 7 support Tb3 or data transfer on both ports? Based on the psref it seems one of the usb-c only does power delivery and doesn't carry data?\n\nThank you.",
  "I'm happy with the same model you had at the $750 price point I got it at but I would be much more excited if I could just swap the processor for a 4700U and keep the 16GB of RAM.",
  "The psref is right, the back USB-C is for charging only.",
  "If you’re talking about the Slim 7, then yeah, you’re in the same boat with lots of people!",
  "That's really silly and a waste of a perfectly good port... No idea why there is no true successor for the 720s and S730 13 inch...",
  "Yes the Slim 7. Like a lot of others have commented, it almost seems like Lenovo is intentionally trying to pin AMD into the \"budget\" category by relegating it to a much lower price point and only 8GB of RAM. I saw the 14\" Slim 7 with 4700U/8GB/512GB for $769 on pre-order at Adorama (they just removed it apparently). It makes no sense because the 4700U is like 75% faster in multi and the GPU is 20%+ faster than the 1065G7 with lower TDP. Intel still gets better Super Pi 1M scores though, so that's something hahaha.  \n\nI'm not sure you're right about the Slim 7 1065G7 having a $905 MSRP. I think that was a sale price and MSRP is still $1200ish.",
  "Yes you’re right, the Slim 7 i7-1065G7 full price is $1200, but the release batch had promotional pricing at $905 until it sold out.\n\nIt looks like the Slim 7 14” AMD is finally out, but just with an 8 GB configuration and with no promotional pricing. I have no idea why they would pair 4700U with 16 GB in the 5 line, but not the 7. The 4800U would be the real jewel, and with this release strategy and the pandemic, who knows when that might be",
  "Pretty late to the party but did you seriously get the 4700U slim 7 for $769? It's currently [$899](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-700-series/IdeaPad-Slim-7-14ARE05/p/88IPS701400) at Lenovo's website right now and I feel like paying that much would be a ripoff compared to yours!",
  "No I got the 15.6\"/i7 1065G7/16GB/512GB for $750, and I said I saw the 4700/8GB/512GB for $769 on Adorama before they took the product page down.",
  "Ah I see. Thanks! How do you like the build quality of the Slim 7? Is it one of the cheaper feeling metal devices or is it something that feels really premium? How's the display? Battery life? I'm probably going to purchase it in a week or two (if it's available) and would like to know your general take on it as well if you don't mind. I'll be getting the model with the Ryzen 7 for $899 (before I apply student discount).",
  "Feels mid-high-tier. Very similar to the C940 except the hinge design uses more plastic (cheaper). The 15.6\" version definitely feels like a $1000+ laptop, but if you look very closely you can tell the tolerances in manufacturing are worse than in more premium devices like the XPS, i.e. small gaps or asymmetries in the chassis, and the plastic hinge is a bit of a bummer. The Slim 7 still looks and feels better than anything HP/Acer/others have on offer in the price range currently.",
  "Thank you for the insight! I'm not looking for XPS build quality but just something that is a good step up from plastic and feels pretty sturdy for college. Hopefully this fits the bill!",
  "Yeah man. I can only attest to the 1080p 15.6\" Intel one. The display is over 300 nits and looks really good, but having a brighter display would definitely be better. The one thing I wish it had that the C940 has is that brighter 400 nit display. Guess that's Lenovo's way of establishing that the Slim 7 is in its premium but still mid-range category; giving it a nicer than average 1080p screen with a mundane brightness output. I think the 14\" you are looking at is in a similar category.",
  "Would this be a good/long lasting laptop for university? Hi, I’m very new to the laptop world I’ve never owned one and I was wondering whether or not this laptop would last me at least 5-6 years. I don’t game at all I just need something to do research, write papers and practice test taking on, I’m primarily looking for something that has a good battery, will last me ~1 day, a decent screen nothing too fancy and nothing that’s gonna be annoyingly slow or get annoyingly slow over time. Please let me know whether or not this is a good laptop thank you! ",
  "Thinkpad would be better.",
  "8 gb ram on Windows is quite questionable",
  "For your use case, it should be fine. Not sure about battery life, though. And you'll probably need to buy some external storage, because you'll fill that 256GB *very* quickly.",
  "The SSD is upgradeable, but it is a 2242 instead of the more common 2280, and the RAM isn't. You may hit a wall with just 8 Gigabytes of RAM. Honestly, you are better off getting a refurbished business laptop. They are generally better-built and repairable. I assume that you're in Canada based on the ad.  For a little more at a local refurb shop, you can get a P14S with more RAM and diskspace and it's repairable & upgradeable.

  "Get a refurbished Thinkpad, better build quality for the same money",
  "If you're expecting to use a bit of Canva or something graphically intensive it's not the good  laptop",
  "8gb of memory is really 2017. Those days are over.  \nIf you can get this with 16gb and you treat it with CARE (it's cheap, so the build quality will be an issue).  \nIf you will only use it for studying you'll be fine, but 256gb is not a lot if you want to put movies and music, games, videos on it.\n\nI also would always fully format and reinstall cheap laptops. In order to keep them cheap they pump them full of software you don't want that makes them REALLY slow.\n\nIf you want a great laptop for the money, go for a 3, 4 year old ex-business laptop. Usually you'll buy a 1500 dollar laptop for 400 dollars that way.",

  "Lenovo has recently been popular for dying motherboards in the long run some happen in 2 years.

  "Get a MacBook, best money can buy.",
  "I purchased a similar model earlier this year and would not suggest a model with soldered ram that's not expandable/replaceable. You'll find that this machine will be annoyingly slow.

  "Why is that?",
  "Really? I feel like my other device had 128gb and I’m not even close to filling it up this may sound stupid but would it apply differently to a laptop? thank you sm!",
  "Thank you!! But I’m a little worried on getting something refurbished just for it to have hidden issues that I’ll discover too late and I’ll have wasted my money",
  "How so? Like what specifications should I look for instead?",
  "First of all thank you so much for this in depth response! Also what do you mean by fully format and reinstall? I considered getting a used one but to be honest I’m extremely concerned with issues that may come with that and lack of warranty and potential hidden issues that wouldn’t show until it’s too late",
  "Really?? How long have you had it and how is the battery life and is the computer slow to process things or not?",
  "Ohh I didn’t know! I assumed since so many people around me bought Lenovos that they were better than hp and asus, also I know this may sound stupid, but does the motherboard die due to lack of care or is it like a wear and tear thing I can’t prevent?",
  "I most definitely do not have the budget for a MacBook 😭😭",

  "Chrome alone uses 8gb ram",
  "OS, and future updates will take a big chunk, so will all your files and any software you need to use for uni.",
  "Your other device was not a laptop.",
  "I had the same mentality, except you should be fine as long as its a business class laptop (especially a thinkpad), the shop is reputable, and you have a warranty.",
  "At least look for something with 16GB",
  "If you want to erase a hard disk so there's nothing left, you have to format it. It'll actually not erase anything but it'll make the computer think there's nothing in that location. and when it needs space it'll just overwrite it. To you the disk will seem empty.  \nYou will then need to reinstall windows by making a usb stick from the microsoft website (it's free), starting the computer from that stick and then putting windows on it from scratch.  \nIt's not something I recommend you do if you have no experience, but it's usually not that expensive to have it done. Or maybe you have friends who want to do it.   \nI'd do it for you for free but I see the price is in dollars, so you're nowhere near me (Netherlands :D).",
  "Not really due to lack of care. Just recently my friend bought one and said he is returning his Lenovo Legion 5 Pro RTX 5060, i asked why he said the cooling is terrible with watching a YouTube video making the CPU temperature reach 80 Celsius and not going down, then to help him I looked and searched a lot then came across this  post\n\n https://www.reddit.com/r/LenovoLegion/s/fgQ8Q9qou6\n\nI think you should really read it carefully if you plan on buying a Lenovo as it appears the issue is not affecting only one line of brand but all.

  "They are cheaper than ever. You’ll be surprised.",
  "They are made of cheap quality plastic.within no time you'll be having problems with hinges and display.so, unless you have strict budget constraints this is not a good choice. Slim 5 models have metal bodies. But still buy a ThinkPad if you can",

He mainly uses laptop for working so powerpoint, word documents, internet searching, Zoom meetings etc. He also liked photography and would like to be able to upload his pictures to his laptop and do some light editing (nothing too advanced though). He doesn’t like Macbooks/Apple I think due to his age he is a Windows man. \n\nI have been looking at the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 as a good option for him, as it has great reviews online. Do you think this would work? \n\nHe wants it to have good longevity as his problem at the moment is laptops don’t seem to last very long for him before they are slow and difficult to use.

  "$500 laptop for school? I need to buy a new laptop for school. My budget is only $500, absolutely no higher.\nI don’t need to be able to game on it, I already have a gaming PC and Lenovo Legion Go lol\n\nHowever, I’m a Mechanical Engineering major so I’ll need to be able to run some heavier software like CAD, MATLAB, other simulation tools, etc.\n\nPortability is also a factor because I’ll be taking it back and forth to work with me every day to do coursework in my downtime.\n\nThe only options I can find near me are the ASUS Vivobook with Intel Core 5 120U and the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U. \nBased on reviews online, and especially on a Reddit, I’m scared to pull the trigger on either one now.\n\nIs there a better option that I haven’t found yet?",

  "What laptop should I buy? Hey everyone! I’m planning to buy a new laptop soon, and I could really use some advice before making the final decision. My budget is around **$600 USD** or less, and I’m looking for a laptop that performs well, looks good, and works smoothly for daily tasks. I mainly need it for **work**, which involves a lot of **video calls**, so a decent **built-in webcam** is actually one of my top priorities. I also tend to have multiple apps and browser tabs open at once, so smooth **multitasking** is really important to me.\n\nOutside of work, I’d like the laptop to handle some casual gaming from time to time. It would be nice if it could run a few games comfortably without overheating or lagging. I also spend a fair amount of time streaming shows and videos, editing documents and presentations, and maybe doing some basic photo or video editing here and there when needed. Overall, I’m looking for a laptop that can handle everyday tasks with ease while still being enjoyable and comfortable to use.\n\nI’ve already done a bit of research and found a few models that seem to fit my needs, but I’m still not sure which one offers the best overall value. I’ll list them below with their prices, along with some quick notes on what I’ve found so far, but I’d love to hear your thoughts or any recommendations you might have.\n\n**$450 USD Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15IAH8**\\- 15.6\" FHD (TN, 250 nits) Intel Core i5-12450H (8 cores, 12 threads), 8GB (soldered) DDR5, 512GB SSD M.2 2242, 1080p Webcam, WiFi 6 , Bluetooth 5.2 , Windows 11 Home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the laptop's material feels cheap, it gets hot quickly, and the battery doesn't last long. It also struggles with gaming and can shut down randomly. While positive reviews say the image quality and Dolby audio are decent, and the camera is great for video calls. The performance is acceptable for work and school. It opens programs fast and charges quickly.\n\nThe second laptop is the same Lenovo laptop but it's the one with an **AMD Ryzen 5 7520U** processor, it does have some other differences so these are the full specs: AMD Ryzen 5 7520U (4C/8T, 2.8/4.3GHz, 2MB L2/4MB L3) 16GB RAM | 512GB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe | 15.6\" matte screen | Windows 11 Home (and Pro on another site). Camera: HD 720p with a privacy shutter.\n\nNegative reviews say that the display isn’t very bright, that it lacks touch functionality, and that the colors have a slight greenish tint. They trash the webcam, saying it's only 720p and not great. The hinge goes all the way back, and the keyboard isn’t backlit. The fan can get noisy during gameplay too.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has an impressive battery life, lasting about 10-11 hours with regular use. The 1080p display is decent, and the built-in speakers sound pretty good. The keyboard is snappy, and the large trackpad is accurate. It has a fingerprint reader for extra security, and you can even open the laptop with one hand.\n\n**$550 Acer Aspire Lite** 15.6\" FHD, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 8 cores Windows 11 Home | integrated AMD Radeon Graphics. DDR4 3200 MHz M.2 PCLE NVMe.\n\nAccording to some reviews, the battery life isn't that good, like 4-5 hours. This is the laptop that the sales clerk recommended. They said the camera quality is decent (like a normal one you would get at this price range).\n\n**$530 ASUS Vivobook Go 15** | AMD Ryzen 5 7520U | 16GB | 512GB SSD | 15.6\" | Windows 11 Home | 2.8GHz (6MB Cache, up to 4.3GHz, 4 cores, 8 Threads) FHD 60 Hz AMD Radeon Web Camera 720p.\n\nNegative reviews say that the fans are slightly loud. It's not suitable for video and photo editing. The webcam is mediocre, not the best one, basically.\n\nPositive reviews say that the battery lasts 7 hours and it charges fully in 1 hour. One review even said that the webcam quality was decent enough.\n\n**$550 ASUS Vivobook 15** AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 16 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM 512 GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD 8 cores integrated AMD Radeon Graphics - 15.6″ FHD windows 11 home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the battery life is not quite long enough to last a full day of work or classes. 1080p display has a cool tint, and it’s heavy at 3.8 pounds.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has above-average build quality and, reliable fingerprint reader on its trackpad. Its backlit keyboard was quiet and satisfying to type on, and its trackpad worked well.\n\nI don't know if this changes anything, but I'm based in Latin America, so do with that information what you will.

  "I have one. Pluses - decent screen for its price, aluminium lid, backlit keyboard. Minuses - pretty noisy, mediocre performance and unreliable. Had freezes and BSODs until the motherboard died after 20 months (Lenovo is infamous for shitty motherboards). Luckily it was within the waranty period so it was replaced. A year later black plastic underneath the screen begin to break, separating screen from the keyboard. So if you're willing to take the risk with the shitty motherboard, low quality plastic and other components - take it. But if you're unwilling to risk and want your laptop to survive more than for 2-3 years, consider other options.",
  "I would go for the Dell 7445 with an AMD 8640hs, 8gb Ddr5 (upgradeable) and 512gb storage. It's a 2- in -1 laptop. I think it suits your needs and performs really well.",
  "It is. I bought something similar 2 years ago. 👍",
  "Honestly, with the right expectations that's probably fine for the price and no one area is critically bad.  Low end 3d games on low settings may run, just don't expect it to be a gaming powerhouse.",

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "I feel conflicted between Lenovo IdeaPad vs Samsung Galaxy Book As the title states, I'm conflicted in which laptop I should have purchased. I was between a \"Lenovo - IdeaPad Slim 3 15.6\" Full HD Touchscreen Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5825U - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Arctic Grey\" and a \"Samsung - Galaxy Book4 15.6\" FHD Laptop - Intel Core 7- 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Silver.\" I'm a grad student who typically just does lot of article reading (no coding) and medical note writing. I'm pretty broke so these two options were within my budget and covered the basics. Any suggestions/reviews would be greatly appreciated!",
  "I’d get the Lenovo personally",
  "I would go with the Lenovo. I have an Ideapad that is 2 year old that has a Ryzen 7 5700u and 12gb of ram (can be expanded). It has been really nice: nice zippy speed, low battery drain, low heat generation, good igpu.\n\nThe Galaxy book has a newer cpu. The new intels are supposed to be better on battery drain and igpu than the older ones like i5 gen 13.\n\nI think Lenovo makes really nice budget pcs. Good ips screen, good battery set up, good hinges. I have never had a hinge issue.\n\nI work on the legal field, and I use a lot of office 365 and Adobe Acrobat Professional, zoom, cisco webex. The Lenovo should handle that well, but there is nothing wrong with the Galaxy Book. They seem to get really good grades in Consumer Reports that tries to test about 200 laptops over a 2 year period.\n\nAs I mentioned the Lenovo budget laptops are better made than some other stuff like Acer and HP. Those 2 are not terrible, but imho Lenovo is better.",
  "What did you get? I was searching for the exact same comparison and this popped up, although I did purchase the Lenovo and was worried I made the wrong decision... thanks.",
  "Thanks for the advice! Appreciate it!",
  "Which laptop is best for coding purposes and multitasking? I don't want a gaming laptop , need it for coding purpose mainly. I am almost going to complete college soon so buying a new laptop which is convenient to carry.\n\nSo, some suggestions are:-\n\n1.

  "NEVER buy asus laptops they are masters in pc motherboards but recently asus is horrible in laptops and their drivers and everything. for you or generally speaking Lenovo should always be your first option because it is with no doubt the best preformance per value in the market or you could also get a HP which are great but i favor Lenovo. and the ideapad slim 5 is THE BEST option, it has the best build quality and also does not break the bank.",
  "Best Laptop For Engineering in AI and Data Science Under $1164 Usecase : 1) as written above just for btech AI & DS, should be durable for 4-5 years.\n2) Gaming isn't priority at all and don't even need seprate GPU for that.\n3) Battery Backup has high priority, and then build quality should be good. \n4) no such brand priority at all but anything that is worth (with good reviews and company support) would be appreciated no matter what company \n\nI am thinking to buy this laptop : PRICE = $1000  (GETTING AT DISCOUNTED PRICE $970 AT AMAZON + 3 YEAR PLANS ) \nLenovo ideapad slim 5 ryzen 7 AI 350 (24 GB RAM | 1 TB | 14 inch | OLED )\nSO if you know anything better and more worth than this above laptop around the range of $1000-$1164 , it would be appreciated. \n",
  "Youre not gonna like me saying this but since your using lots of ai I would recommend a thinkpad p series maybe a p52. I'll give you some reasons.\n1. They are upgradeable and repairable\n2. They are pretty cheap\n3. They have a great community who can help you with any problems you face.\n4.Great build quality\n\nI would recommend buying from ebay but you should see the seller description before you buy it and only buy from reputable sellers.

  "No i am open to any suggestion but the problem is i need the laptop in my hands within next week not more than that which i think is not possible in case of thinkpads they take time to get delivered.",

  "First one, the amd two in one is def a good deal especially if you like the two in one feature.",
  "First fosho, that’s a great price and I *love* having a 2 in 1. If you are a student, see if you can get a discount to bring that down even more and that will be a godly deal",
  "In this case choose AMD Ryzen 8000 Series over Intel Meteor Lake U Series. Similar battery efficiency but the AMD has better integrated graphics.",

  "1",
  "Pure garbage. Don't buy this thing, many reported hinge problems including mine. Few months after the 2-year warranty expired, my left plastic hinge cover cracked and crushes the display glass. Thankfully the LCD still works fine, touchscreen is dead 1/3 of the display. \n\nTried to complaint to Lenovo service center and whaddya know, 2 people also had the same problem (they still got their warranty). Unfortunately they couldn't do anything.\n\nThe screen is also dim and muted in colors. The addition of touchscreen is nice, but not as nice when it broke. Do yourself a favor and get a Thinkpad or Ideapad 5 Pro if you're going Lenovo as they are much more robust.",
  "I have the second one, the Slim 5i and I would not recommend it for $700 in 2025 for three reasons.\n\nIt is slim but takes up a lot of surface area with the taller 16:10 screen ratio. Not something you want to carry around. \n\nThe big screen would be great but it isn't color accurate or bright. Has a 45% NTSC rating where everything including YouTube feels washed out with a layer of white colors. Basically the same screen they were using in 2021, and likely just threw it on here because they have a lot of old stock.\n\nThe internals feels underpowered and lacks quality. Trackpad makes a flimsy clicky noise, keyboard isn't as polished with key travel, speakers sound tinny with no bass, webcam feels like a phone camera from 2015, it doesn't have 40 GBps thunderbolt 4 instead just basic 5GBps USB c ports. The Core 7 is a rebranded 2023 processor, not to be confused with the new Core ULTRA 7 processor from 2024.\n\nIf you haven't already you can go to a Costco and see these on display and play around with them. I doubt this lasts anywhere near 10 years like your old laptop, maybe just 3.",
  "duly seconded. the processor is a beast, the laptop itself is a good size, and it's too good of a value",
  "the second one is a bad deal considering the processor......its no way near close to the 8840hs performance...also the IGPU is very good",

  "Options for general use + work Hello,\n\n  \nI'm looking for a laptop for general web browsing, but also would have to use it for work.\n\nAs for work, I need some basic office suits like document writings and also some programming/data analysis using Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy and scipy.\n\n  \nIt would be ideal that it would have a long battery life. I'm not interested in games.\n\n  \nI found some options that might fit my needs, although there are some notes that I may add further down below. These are my top 3 picks:\n\n  \n1. Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5\n\n* 13.3'' inch screen (100% sRGB)\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7735 HS\n* 16GB LPDDR5x-6400 RAM\n* 512GB SSD\n* Price: \\~ 940 USD\n\n2. Asus Vivobook 14\n\n* 14'' screen (45% NTSC)\n* Intel Core Ultra 5 225H\n* 16GB DDR5 on board (it doesn't specify the frequency)\n* 512 GB SSD\n* Price: \\~ 940 USD\n\n3. Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3\n\n* 14'' screen (45% NTSC)\n* Intel Core i5-13420H\n* 24GB DDR5-4800 MHz (8GB on board + 16GB SO-DIMM)\n* 512GB SSD\n* Price: \\~870 USD\n\n  \nSo, a few notes to be added. I was initially thinking of buying laptops with the U series intel CPUs. But could only find from past generations, at most 13th. By the way, the new Intel name scheme seems confusing to me. Why not keep the same nomenclature as before?!\n\n\n\nThe IdeaPad Slim 3 seems to me like a good option because of the increase in the RAM, even though the CPU is from 2 generations ago.\n\n\n\nI know the IdeaPad Slim 5 is also with a CPU from 2023, but I really like the idea of having a small and light laptop like this. I previously owned a heavy gaming laptop and it was horrible to carry it around everywhere. Looking for the opposite now, so this one looks like a good option. However, I'm also looking for long battery life, and I don't know how a HS CPU would affect this.\n\n  \nThe Asus has the most modern CPU, but I've seen a review where it states that the body, keyboard etc are not so good.\n\n  \nAt any rate, I would appreciate any comment on those options. Is the the new Ultra 5 worth it, even though the laptop itself is fragile and not good? Would the increase in RAM make the IdeaPad Slim 3 a better option on cost/benefit?",
  "All of those should be fine for your use cases. Personally I would choose number 3, because you could upgrade the RAM if you need to in future. Also for your programming are you going to be any machine learning tasks? If so, I might recommend getting a laptop with a GPU.",
  "Help deal ends soon- Laptop for gift-below any good? Gifting a laptop for mother day, will be used for work, will need to handle fast downloads of large files while efficiently running multiple office apps. No gaming or video editing.\n",
  "Yeah, might not be the newest chip on the block, but being 8 cores, 16 threads, it's still PLENTY performant.  With 16GB ram for smooth multitasking, should handle the things you mention without any issues.  The only major downside on it, and it's to be expected at this price, is the display is incredibly underwhelming.  It's USABLE, but never will be confused with a good display.",
  "How large are the files?",
  "The laptop should be perfect for what she needs to do. The SSD will guarantee fast read/write speeds to the drive, so the only limitation on download speed is the speed of your mother's home WiFi.",
  "Good call, knew there had to be some downside.",
  "A couple hundred mbs.",
  "Itll be fine then lol",
  "What laptop should I get? I'm an engineering student who also works in research and coding, and I'm looking for a new laptop. I was currently using my dad's old ThinkPad T450s, and it lasted 8 years and still works smoothly, but the battery life has deteriorated a lo,t and it's just not portable anymore. I'm looking for a new laptop on a more student-friendly budget that would work well with VSCode/Vim, Linux, and VMs. Here are some of my choices:\n\n**ThinkPad E-series 14:**\n\n* Intel Core Ultra 5 125U Processor (E-cores up to 3.60 GHz, P-cores up to 4.30 GHz)\n* 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\n* Windows 11 Home\n* Cost: ₹68.9k\n\nI don't know much about the quality and performance of the ThinkPad E-series, though. Since it has a U-processor, I'm a bit unsure about its performance.\n\n**Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3:**\n\n* 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13620H processor\n* 16GB RAM LPDDR5-4800 | 512GB SSD, expandable up to 1TB\n* Cost: ₹66k\n\nHonestly, the processor seems good, but I've heard negative reviews about the build quality of IdeaPads.\n\n**MacBook Air:**\n\n* Apple M1 chip\n* 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage\n* Cost: ₹59k\n\nAlthough I've heard positive reviews of MacBook Airs from professionals, the storage throws me off a bit, and many people don't recommend them for college.\n\nSome of the other laptops I've considered are Lenovo LOQ and ASUS, but these are my personal top choices. If you guys have any suggestions for any other laptops or experience with any of the laptops listed above, I'd appreciate any advice.",
  "I am also looking at laptops but I can say one thing for sure. **Do not buy a MacBook**, a lot of engineering software is not compatible or doesn't run well. I get that they are attractive in terms of battery life and power but it's just not good for this type of work. \n\n\nI also noticed that intel works a bit better with low level programming and is a bit more stable with Linux. The new intel CPUs are quite nice with battery life and performance. \n\nFrom the laptops that you provided I would get the ThinkPad with intel 5 125U, the performance is alright, I am using a Ryzen 5 5600H and this intel is better in every way. The build quality on ThinkPad was always ok, the E series are a budget friendly for people that can't buy a T series or X1.\n\nEdit: the CPU in the IdeaPad is going to be a bit more powerful in computing but the integrated graphics are way worse and the power efficiency is also worse, so I guess if you value battery life and graphics, the ultra is the obvious choice.",
  "I'm considering a thinkpad with ryzen 7 since it's also budget friendly. Def not considering a macbook anymore. Thanks for the advice",
  "Which laptop should I get? I am deciding between the first two laptops in the below images — Dell Inspiron or Lenovo Ideapad 3 (ignore the 3rd HP laptop, not interested in it). I do not game but will occasionally stream videos on my PC. I also do simple Python coding for my Raspberry Pi.\n\nJust looking for feedback on which is better. I have no experience with Ryzen but the price point is better on that one. TIA!",
  "I did the slim 3 as I wanted the 16gig of ram. Most the time for this 8 is fine but for it to always run \"smooth\" I wanted that.",
  "The laptop that got at least 16gb DDR4 ram 500gb SSD and a  decent CPU not under 2-3ghz and not under 5 cores if you follow that rules you get a decent laptop but for gaming there other rules",
  "I am just about to buy the Ryzen 5.",
  "The Dell Inspiron also has 16gb. I agree that I want nothing less than 16gb though. 8gb works fine today but likely wont be enough in 4 years, and I plan to own this more than 4 years.",
  "Enough for video editing?",
  "I don't really know but the last time I looked you needed some performance for video editing",
  "But I would not buy a laptop with a CPU like Celeron n the CPU Hase 4cores and works only with 1.1ghz and think that hase only 8gb RAM because that's is modern E-waste from a Fabrik and you don't gonna have fun using it .when you don't have mutch money I would recommend you to look on eBay for something decent",
  "My first laptop... What all things would I do? I got the ideapad slim 5 (ryzen 7 chip 16gb ram). As this is my first purchase of a laptop, I dont know what are the settings and configurations to make initially. I'll work on software development, with some minimal multimedia consumption. No games. I'm expecting a longer battery. So what should I setup for a healthy life for the laptop with good performance. Also lenovo has some unwanted softwares like McAfee. I can delete them right? Please share what you guys do when first buying a lappy...\n\np.s. will post a review soon",
  "Sweet starting spot would be to reinstall windows if it came with extreme bloat, then get all the updates via windows update (including drivers) done (don't use 3rd party for now) then get to the Ninite page to install all the apps u want and do it all, plugged in...most importantly check if there's any BIOS update before hand, update it before doing anything",
  "These are the things I do EVERY time I format a windows PC\n\nOpen Edge and get one of these:  \nInstall OperaGX  \nInstall Brave\n\nOpen Windows Store and install 2 applications\n\n1. Hash Checker (the one with the thumb print) Quick and Easy Signed Software Checker\n2. Ookla Speed Test\n\nThen:  \nInstall Keepass  \nInstall BitDefender (optional but I like it)  \nInstall Nord VPN  \nInstall SteamGames  \nInstall EpicGames  \nInstall BattleNet  \nInstall Libre Office (Free and Open Source Software)  \nInstall WinRar  \nInstall VLC Player\n\nUninstall Microsoft Office  \nUninstall Onedrive  \nuninstall all the cheap games\n\nThen run and install Windows updates. I also rename my computer at this stage by going to:\n\nRight click Start > System > Rename this PC. Give it a name that if it came up on the network no one would know what it is. Like SpiderMonkey. That way when people see the name they need to work a tiny bit harder to identify the device.\n\nGo to  windows settings. Start > cog or hold the WIN key + i  \nGo to privacy. Disallow EVERYTHING.  \nGo to Personalisation. Add Extra buttons to start menu. Turn off suggestions of any kind. Pick colours for Menus  \nImport my own 'Desktop Backgrounds' Folder I've built up over time and make one my background.\n\nFinally. Go to the task manager > More Details > Startup tab.  \nDisable anything you don't want to start when your computer starts. (Especially useful for laptops because this will save both processing power and battery life).\n\nWith most laptops you get a charge to 80% option. This means you can leave your charger plugged in and when it hits 80% charge it will trickle charge to keep the battery better for longer.\n\nApplications and customisation is of course subjective but one thing you never do it just give Microsoft everything. Turn off what you don't use and put electrical tape over your camera. I got my laptop back in september and I've not used the webcam once. Of course this is different for everyone. Either way. Safer is better.\n\nEnjoy your new computer. I hope this helps =D+< If you need any help doing any of these things above. Just leave a comment and ill get back to you in due time.",
  "I have the Pro version. If you have questions ask me, I also made a review https://www.reddit.com/r/Lenovo/s/QH4JXUT9QR",

  "Why didn't you go with Asus Vivobook S? \n\nI'm just curious, as I want to get a laptop with this cpu next year:)) \n\nI also have a Vivobook nowadays,but the mobo got brown around vrm chips because I played games in 80-96 c for too long, so I wanna replace it next year",
  "I mean it's more of a personal choice... I really like the centre aligned one.",
  "there's like a million videos on YT to fresh/clean install windows...make sure u have a minimum 8gigs of thumb drive tho to flash the ISO file into",
  "The one with the X elite ? As cool as it is, it’s kinda eh. The 8845HS is still more powerful, the X elite has more compatibility issues and bugs, and stuff like this. Battery still stays on top with the X elite (along Apple silicon)\n\nAnd it’s also more. For a bit more than the price of my Ideapad, you can only have a worse X Plus with 16gb of ram.",

  "Ohhhh this ? For only 1K usd ? If that’s legit rush lol, if I could’ve bought this I would’ve bought it but they had to announce the 370 and 365 a week after I bought my laptop",

  "Need a system for productivity, VM work, and light gaming with good battery I get into a lot of network simulation like GNS3 and EveNG to run network devices and systems VMs. I also am taking some online ethical hacking courses that uses a lot of VMs for Linux and windows. I don’t like staying plugged in all the time, so I’m trying to find a good mix.\n\nLast year i bought the Yoga Slim 9i 16” and it was fantastic except the battery. That was a joke. It would die with casual use within 2-3 hours or less, and that was with me turning down settings and going to 60hz. If that’s how it needs to be used, what’s the point of all the extra power and features? So I sold it. My 15” MacBook Air M2 has been working out for productivity, but I really need a Windows system back for my VM and simulation stuff. I also miss gaming a little here and there. \n\nI am just not sure what will end up being more important to me feature wise (screen, weight, battery, dGPU etc). I am looking at three systems and leaning towards AMD for battery life, but the Core Ultra 9 185h has more cores for VM work and seems to do ok on battery depending on the system. I also love a good screen, but I don’t do a lot of media consumption really. I don’t know I will actually take advantage of miniLED/OLED or not.\n\nThree systems:\nLenovo Yoga Pro 9 w/o miniLED 32Gb, Intel 185H, 4050 (IPS version is on sale for 1299 at Best Buy. The miniLED version is $600 more because it isn’t on sale, and that’s too much extra)\nLenovo Thinkpad P16s Gen 2 w/ 7840u, 64gb ram, 1tb SSD, 4k OLED 60hz New in Box for $910 (AMD does ok casual gaming, so no dGPU is ok but I kinda prefer one)\nLenovo Ideapad Pro 5 w/ Intel Ultra 9 185H, 32Gb ram, 4050, 2k OLED 120hz refurbished for $850. (Has mixed reviews and a loud track which can annoy me)\n\nI am also trying to stick to under $1500.\n\nIf anybody else knows of something, my needs are:\n16” Nice screen w/ higher resolution (doesn’t have to be 4k) don’t care about high refresh rate on laptops. I’ve had it, and it didn’t much for me.\n32-64GB of ram (VMs take up a lot of ram)\nMany CORES (Ultra 9 has more than 8840U or HS, but not sure how much that will impact VM use)\nGood battery life without having to make it feel like a $300 laptop in features.\nNumberpad - Inputting IP address on a top row of keys is horrible. I have to do that some when i work remote for my job since my work laptop is 14”\n\nThere are a ton of options that fit all of this except battery life. It sucks to constantly worry about plugging in to keep working. I wanted the new Ryzen Ai 370 but there are no systems that meet my criteria except one new MSi system that is priced too high for the specs. I wish I didn’t want the numpad, but I really need it.\n",

Problem is when you want a good one for 450. But at 1000 level, all the models are more than decent. \n\nIf you can put 100 more, I would go for the Schenker Via Pro 14. Dual m2 slot, 32gb ram, powerful ryzen, super light, super nice, german company.",
  "Needed some help So I have a limited budget.  (I’m in the UK & have a credit account with Very so wanted to get something for black friday), I am looking for a laptop around £300/350, I’ve been seeing and looking at Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3, Intel Core i3, 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, (  https://www.very.co.uk/lenovo-ideapad-3-amd-ryzen-5-8gb-ram-512gb-ssd-156in-full-hd-laptop-arctic-grey/1600944328.prd) I don’t know much about laptops so I just wanted some pointers. \n\nI will be using the laptop for internet usage, light gaming e.g. Stardew valley, dave the diver, nothing of heavy usage (& I may not even use it for gaming), watching videos & casting them to the TV, productivity uses (writing a new cv, occasional zoom meetings nothing too demanding). I’ve been doing research but stumbling upon not being able to find much information on said laptop and reviews on the performance. \n\nI do also have a few other alternatives but I did initially like the Lenovo Ideapad I’ve just seen people saying the hinges are unreliable and support on Lenovos end is lacking, so I don’t want to spend what little money I do plan to spend on a laptop that will inevitably not be worth the money! \n\nI’ve also linked other laptops i’m potentially considering too: \n\nhttps://www.very.co.uk/acer-aspire-3-laptop-14in-fhdnbspamd-ryzen-5-8gb-ram-256gb-ssd/1600913666.prd\n\nhttps://www.very.co.uk/asus-vivobook-15-laptop-156in-fhdnbspintel-core-i3-8gb-ram-256gb-ssd-silver/1600939485.prd\n\nhttps://www.very.co.uk/hp-15-fc0008na-laptop-156in-fhd-amd-ryzen-5-8gb-ram-256gb-ssdnbspwith-microsoftnbsp365-personal-1-year-amp-norton-360-deluxe-3-devices-1-year-includednbsp--silver/1600944327.prd\n\nEdit: Thank you in advance for any help or advice! :) \n& I’m not a student or going to be travelling much (just to and from my house to my boyfriends which i will get a laptop case for any laptop I do choose to get)!

  "if that is your narrow and limited set of choices, then for sure get the Ryzen CPU (last option on list)\n\nit is faster than i3\n\ndon't bother gaming much on it, all of those options are pretty terrible for gaming, unless you're playing something super old school like Minecraft or Roblox",
  "I forgot to actually edit the information for the main laptop i was considering, i’ve put the details here: Lenovo\nIdeaPad 3, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB RAM 512GB SSD, 15.6in Full HD Laptop - Arctic Grey\n\nhttps://www.very.co.uk/lenovo-ideapad-3-amd-ryzen-5-8gb-ram-512gb-ssd-156in-full-hd-laptop-arctic-grey/1600944328.prd \n\nso i’m not sure if this is actually better or worse than any of the other options i’ve laid out on this post? :)",
  "get the Lenovo with the Ryzen. \n\nthe link you shared in this thread just now.\n\nideapad is a nicer build than the HP\n\nHP build quality improves dramatically on the more expensive Z book and Elitebooks, nothing in the category you are looking at, however, so just disregard HP entirely for your selection.",
  "thank you for your help :)",
  "Is my laptop enough for my needs I recently started college (pursuing Masters in  Computer Applications) and hence was in need of a new laptop. Do note that I had very limited experience with computers prior. In our course we learn programming and coding and other related things, so I had to keep that in mind while selecting.\n\nEventually I ended up buying Lenovo IdeaPad slim 3, with i5 1235U processor and 16Gb ram and 512 GB SSD. But after buying I came to know from many tech reviewers and my friends that U grade processors are good only for light tasks such as internet surfing and content consumption, and one should choose P or H grade processors for programming.\n\nNow I am in double mind as to if my device will be able to keep up with the tasks for the next 3 years or not. So far, I have been using Vscode and Virtual Box and they are working just fine. Can anyone who has experience in this field help me clear the confusion?",
  "The \"U\" doesn't mean it's for light tasks , yes it have lower performance than non U products but it offers far better battery life and that should make things easier for you . \n\n\nI had i 5 5200u (2 cores 4 threads ) and basically it ran any programing app , Microsoft visual studio , microsoft visual studio code , mySQL , matlab , android studio ...\n\n\n\nIt really depends on what you gonna use it for , maybe check what other programs you will need to install in the future and if they requires heavy hardware .",
  "It all depends on the patience of the users. People switching from gaming desktop to on-go laptop are likely to feel performance degradation on regular usage.16 ram is enough of multitasking with Android studio. I purchased an intel i7 13700h laptop because it may start behaving with the performance of the u-series after 4-5 years as the apps keep on upgrading over the years. \n\nGood to go for 4 to 5 years with a stable performance.",
  "U is more power efficient and have enough power to run your daily tasks . Your base frequency might be 1.3 ghz but it can boost upto above 4 ghz when needed.",
  "It's good enough and quite new, don't listen to those guys. You can even code on a 5 years old pentium.\nThis i5 12th gen will be enough for most of your needs."
