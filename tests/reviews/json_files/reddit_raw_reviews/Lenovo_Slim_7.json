  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",
  "This is why I'm planning to upgrade my X1 carbon g5 to g13. It will be expensive, but it will be worth it I hope.",
  "i have one, i love it and find it enjoyable but im not a lappy connoisseur like you ive only had desktops for last decade, i will monitor this touchpad thing and touchscreen issue, but i use a bt mouse mostly, and i dont have this glow on the screen, or not that i notice, everything else seems manageable\n\ntry one more replacement, what other options are there right now? i dont think it looks or feels cheap. i like same things as you, the usb c on both sides, i like the weight and solid feel, the shiny bright screen, speakers, fast solid bt and wifi, keyboard, low bloatware, amazing battery and playing gta v\n\nmy bt 5.3/4 can let me use my earphones all the way in the shower room which i couldnt do with my previous 5.1 or whatever, thats big life immprovement for me\n\ni feel the top function row of keys the backlight bleeds through the bottom of the row a bit much depending on angle but not a big deal",
  "This is a very interesting review. Currently not many reviews for this model. Have you got chance to try other Lunar Lake models?",
  "Nice review! Would you mind sharing how the Aura's screen compares to the SL7 you previously had? And how the fan noise in the SL7 was for you in the same setup you mentioned with external monitor?",
  "Thanks for this insightful review.\nRegarding the fan noise, is it possible to use tpfancontrol (or more recent) to customise it ? On both T15 (Gen 1) and L14 they work well to start the fan sooner than the firmware does, but I do not know whether it is possible to delay the fan startup...\nThanks,\nP.S. : additional question : what is the lowest rpm that tpfancontrol can achieve ?",
  "I noticed a big difference in performance after uninstalling the bloatware. Battery is great, response is snappy, touchpad is fine, not great, screen is lovely.

Best non Mac I’ve ever owned, and I think the x1 carbon will be better in terms of build quality but couldn’t see myself doubling the cost for materials and same specs. \n\nAll in all, a very solid, reliable piece of equipment.",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",
  "For me, the biggest issues so far:\n\n1. Occasional phantom touches - similar to the OP\n\n2. eGPU compatibility (GPD G1) - it used to work with meteor lake laptop which I had (YogaBook 9i).

  "  \nI have had this laptop for a week. I have updated everything that needed updating (Windows and all relevant drivers). Everything is fine except for the Wi-Fi, which is very slow. I usually connect it to my phone’s hotspot (an S23 Ultra), and when I tested it with Ookla Speedtest, the download speed never exceeded 180 kb/s (0.18 Mb/s), while the upload speed reached up to 4 Mb/s. It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do? I bought this from BestBuy in the U.S., but I’m currently not in the United States. While returning it is not impossible, it would be very difficult, and I would prefer to resolve the issue without having to return it.",

  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues.

For example, unless it's one of the newest MacBook pros, you might be used to an incredibly glossy screen that leads to a busted user experience if there are windows or uncontrolled lights nearby.\n\nMy M1 Max MacBook Pro was also incredibly laggy for things like window snapping and some other things where I couldn't get rid of the animation and you just have to wait for part of a second from time to time before you can do things.\n\nPretty amazing that it compares to a multi-thousand dollar laptop, but also multi-thousand dollar laptops these days can be pretty disgusting, or at least that has been my experience with the M1 Max, and some Windows laptops from Dell, Asus, and Framework being laggy with windows 11.\n\nMaybe it's just a software problem though and I shouldn't be comparing wildly inefficient operating systems like Mac OS and Windows 11 to things like debloated Windows 10 or Linux on a 12-year-old Thinkpad originally rated for 24 hours of battery life.",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "How do the speakers compare to the MBP?  Thx",
  "I currently have the G16 and the aura and when it comes to speaker quality, these two are pretty close. the G16 has a slightly fuller bass and slightly wider sound stage. In my opinion if the G16 are a 10, the Aura speakers are a 9.5. I also feel the browsing experience to be much better on the Aura. I experience more lag on the G16 and the fans kick on, the SOC can get too hot for the G16 to sit on the lap, even with light browsing. That being said the track pad on the G16 is better. while the keyboard on the Aura is much better",
  "I was thinking of buying this but it has way too much bass, since I listen to music a lot that's a dealbreaker for me. Also, the bass resonates across the laptop body which creates a weird sensation if you're typing while listening to music. I tried adjusting equalizer in dolby software but still couldn't get the sound right. Did you find a solution to eliminate bass (so chassis doesn't resonate) and music becomes clear?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "I just did, looks good from any angle.",
  "Thanks for your review. I finally decided not to buy this model (it's in my cart for a few days).",
  "Thanks for the insight. Where did you see others complaining about the touchpad issue? If it's not isolated to my machine I'm afraid it may be drivers / firmware.",
  "sounds like an issue with Intel ultra series 2 to be honest.  \n  \ncan anyone who has tested other series 2 intel laptops confirm?",
  "I wud return it for the annoying spinning wheel alone",
  "I wish the X1 carbon line still had good IPS panels. OLED isn't for me. P14s gen 5 has a nice 120hz 3k IPS, I might consider that one.",
  "Hey, I'm thinking of picking up this machine, but I'm curious to know how much battery life you're getting?",
  "Haven't tried any other Lunar Lake laptops as of yet. There will allegedly be a SL7 for business with Lunar Lake next year, thinking about waiting for that. Though knowing Microsoft they'll charge an arm and a leg for 32Gb.",
  "I also posted a review of SL7 a few months ago if you wanted to have a look. The SL7's display is pretty comparable to the Aura's. It had worse PPI (201 vs 222), and worse subjective calibration making it bit washed out, but didn't have the IPS glow issues of the Aura. The AR coating was also better. I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve. The chassis would get way too warm in heavier tasks and the fan would hardly do anything. But still, I prefer the SL7's acoustics. No noise in a docked setup.",
  "Cant seem to get it working on the Aura.",
  "What did you uninstall? ",
  "Which bloatware did you remove?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "Thanks for the recommendation on uninstalling the bloatware.  Any update on the laptop?",
  "It's annoyingly reflective. And it's a pitty because under the perfect conditions it's really nice to look at. But it's a laptop so conditions change and are rarely perfect",
  "Is it a problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "The low RPM noise isn’t too bad, it’s just the fact it’s there at all that irks me. It’s completely unnecessary to have such an aggressive fan curve with a Lunar lake chip inside, but I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker. \n\nThe eye strain comes from the GPU, not the glossy display surface. Same strain when docked. Seems to be recent intel GPU’s from what I’ve read, causing issues for those sensitive to dither, or whatever rendering technique it is that causes the pain.",
  "The Aura screen dimensions are compatible with the MacBook Air 15. Get a MBA 15 compatible matte screen protector, and it'll greatly reduce glare and reflections on the Aura.",
  "was this 16 or 32gb of ram?",
  "BTW, as an update to my experience, I have my touchscreen replaced as it seems to be touchscreen issue instead of touchpad. For a week, touchwood, no such touchpad issues anymore.\n\nThe only remaining gripe I have would be the lack of compatibility with my GPD G1.",
  "Have you uninstalled McAfee already? It will greatly improve system performance. The Microsoft antivirus software built in Windows is better. That's probably the first thing to do after unpacking a new Lenovo laptop.",
  "It's really subjective. Do you have any issues with other modern devices? In laptops I find Intel Xe iGPU's to be bad for eye strain, Nvidia perfectly fine, AMD tolerable but not ideal.",
  "For my ghost touches issue, turns out I went to Lenovo repair centre to have screen replaced, then as of these weeks the ghost touch issue is gone for me.",
  "how did it go? did you send it in and is it still working?",
  "Hello \n\nI am going to buy this laptop soon.\n\nIs there display glare problem a deal breaker?  \nSome people mentioned : glossy displays leading to poor battery life because you have to crank up brightness to max to combat glare.\n\nThanks",
  "Its not easy to buy a laptop nowadays. many models and there are issues on each model. No windows laptop is perfect it seems, unless you pay big amount to Thinkpad series highend one.",
  "Luckily the 15.3\" screen is the same size as the Macbook Air 15, so you could pick up a matte screen protector.",
  "[I just reviewed it](https://smbtech.au/features/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-aura-edition-laptop-review/) and got 26.5 hours. That's a new record on my site.",
  "After using for some time, I think it’s similar to surface laptop screen. It’s reflective but with decent resolution. Colors are vibrant. I mostly work inside so it’s been fine. Working outside might be slightly tough because the screen is pretty reflective (not as good coating as MacBook). If you turn up the brightness to 100% that might make it better for outside work.",
  "I think the same, if not even better.   So loud and clear and good bass too.   I've tested both the 14\" and the 15.3 and had zero issues.  I think the one this person is talking about was just a lemon",
  "Not really, I just got used to it.",
  "Barely but yes. You can be outside (in the shade of course) and make do while in light mode. It's a mirror though, so you gotta find the right angle.",
  "Thank you so much - I really appreciate it. This makes it a buy for me. ",
  "Glad I could help make that tough decision! Not many choices right now that are similar to Yoga 7i Aura Edition but hoping we get some new releases soon...",
  "I read about a couple folks mentioning unresponsive touchpad in some YouTube comments and in r/lenovo comments as well",
  "You probably don't need this anymore but its around 8 hours minimum for demanding stuff, WAY higher with regular use. Much more than one needs. If you plan on using it for several days in a row, just bring the charger.",
  "As I sit here looking at my non-upgradeable to Windows 11 Surface Book 2.  You felt and looked premium, I paid a lot for your middle tier processor, I learned what heat throttling was, sometimes you think the screen is disconnected when it isn't, we had a good run. No more MS laptops for me thanks.",
  "Just read it, some great detailed insights there. Definitely swaying me towards getting the SL7, especially given the low/no noise from the fans which is very important to me. Thanks for replying!",
  "How would you compare the screen reflectivity between the SL7 and the Aura? Still waiting for my Aura to arrive",
  "OK, thanks for trying, it is good to know that it is not compatible... by the way, there are several variants, depending on the model (eg 1 or 2 fans) : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qjlal2/tpfan_control_on_newer_thinkpads_share_your/\n\nOn the Aura, there is also a built-in BIOS configured power management, accessible through Fn+Q command : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1fufeoa/lenovo_yoga_slim_7i_aura_edition_ama/lqcjek5/",
  "What if you set the performance/fan mode to quiet? Does that make it quiet enough? I'm thinking of getting this too and have heard mixed reviews about fan noise",
  "Ya, it’s been hit or miss on battery life. Touchpad gets finicky w longer use, appears to be pretty sensitive to the oils on the skin and any grime so I try to use the mouse. I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",
  "Its actually not too bad in person (at best buy) when viewed side by side to the book 4 screen.   I think the book 5 screen has more anti-reflective coating and they did not have that model for testing.",
  "Is the reflection problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "Does anyone tried this?",
  "It had been on sales for £1100 for the Aura 258V 32GB RAM model in the UK (e.g. Lenovo Store, Currys).",
  "Yes the 32 GB version with Intel 258V. Seems like some of the discounts are now gone.",
  "I have the same ghost touch issue, sending it in for repair under warranty in 2 days.  \nhow was you experience with the repair and is it still working?  \nAsking since i have heard many bad things about Lenovo's repair service.",
  "May i ask if you’ve found a solution for connecting to the gpd g1? I am looking to buy a compact egpu to use with the slim 7i aura on the go. 🙏",
  "That was one of the first things I did",
  "I'm looking to replace an old Dell XPS 9360 laptop with the following specs: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz 2.00 GHz. If I had no eye strain issues with this, do you think I should be ok with the Slim 7i Aura?",
  "Tell me how the type of graphics card can affect eye strain. Eye strain and other discomforts are caused by PWM and temporal dithering. These are defects or characteristics of displays, and intervening components are unlikely to be the cause, but I could be wrong. Please comment.",
  "I exchanged it",
  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast. The screen is very glossy though. if you work in a very bright room with bright background/light behind you, then yeah it can be very annoying to clearly see your reflection on the screen even at 80% brightness. it's depends see if you can find a sample in the nearest store.",
  "I like your little candy cane for scale",
  "Can you share me the settings that you have used while testing this and was there any major tweaks done to this? I got the same laptop but seems like my idle drain is little bit higher, although I did clean install of windows.",
  "Is it good?",
  "HP's new OmniBook Flip looks good, but its battery is a bit small. Maybe I'll wait for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura edition. It'll be very expensive at the release time though.",
  "A few alternatives appeared in recent months:\n\n[**MSI Prestige 14 AI Evo C1MG**](https://smbtech.au/features/msi-prestige-14-ai-evo-c1mg-laptop-review-2024/) – MSI’s, matte-screened 14-inch, business-oriented rival is larger, but more powerful.

  "Ah, interesting. Looks like a universal issue then.",
  "Both are glossy glass surfaces, but I remember the SL7 looked less reflective. The aura can look a bit mirror-like at times.",
  "My bluetooth is awful.  I can pair all devices, but they will NOT stay connected.  My earbuds connected, and I was able to use them for about 1 minute or so, but I could only get the Right side to receive sound.

  "You could try to check if the problem is related to your Windows install, or a hardware issue (e.g. WiFi chip, antenna connection). \n\nOne relatively easy way would be to create a Linux bootable USB stick (e.g. Ubuntu). Boot up from the Linux USB stick and check the WiFi speeds. \n\nIf the speeds in Linux are normal, you could then try a \"clean install\" of Windows (download Windows USB install media from Microsoft website).\n\nIf the WiFi speed in Linux is also very low, then it might be worth opening up the laptop and checking the WiFi chip and antennas (does not void warranty). Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",
  "Did you exchange with the same model? Or what else did you get instead?",
  "Understand it looks like a deal breaker to me, however spec is really good on this pc.",

  "If it's dropped like that again it will be Number 1, or very near it. Prices are a rollercoaster at this time of year and there's not much in it. There's a whisker between these and choosing what suits you best will leave you with a great laptop either way.",
  "The 9i looks like a nice machine especially with mini-LED, but the chassis is quite cheaply made, like the Pro 7. All plastic interior, including the hinge assembly.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo. I have a desktop that goes 165hz and that's more for gaming. sure it's smooth and all but eh not worth the batt life tradeoff).\n\nif you realllly wanna stretch the life, use MS edge as ur browser cuz that's the least battery draining browser out there.

It has a 60Wh battery. Or IdeaPad slim 5 gen 10 with ai 7 350. The processor and battery combination in this one is deadly (and so is the price). 55k\n\nI think this would help you in picking up a good battery life laptop hopefully.",
  "yes, it should be sufficient",
  "Thank you",
  "Any reviews/experience for the ThinkPad E14 G7 with Intel Ultra 7 258v CPU? I could only find reviews for the version with the 255U, because that version launched first.\nI'm mainly interested in it's battery life, because I'm looking for a laptop with decent performance and long battery life. \nNeeds to be x86 (want to dual boot Linux), so I've been looking at the Lunar Lake chips. Because Ram is soldered I'm going for 32 GB.\nThe other laptops I'm considering (Asus Zenbook, Vivobook 14, Lenovo Yoga slim 7, Acer Swift ai 14) all have glossy screens, the E14 G7 seems to be the only one in my price range (<1500€) with a matte screen. ",
  "its just gonna be maybe an hour less i dont think battery life is that deep of an issue",
  "I have a 268v cpu in my laptop and it is pretty slow compared to my desktop cpu. You would be better of getting an AMD HX 370 or 395.",
  "Did you buy the laptop OP?",
  "Yeah, I'm almost certain it will be fine, I just don't like the idea of buying a laptop without seeing at least one review of the specific model. Will probably buy it because spec wise it fits my needs the best",
  "Yeah, I bought it, I'm quite satisfied, mainly with the battery life. I haven't stress tested the performance, because so far I've mostly used it for office type work.\nDo you have a specific question about it?",
  "Cool",
  "Great, yes I wonder about fan noise. I would like a TP but with recent new CPU's I worry some of them get hot under load. I also would use it mostly for office work though.\n\nWhen doing basic task, does the fan turn on often, if so, is it audible? If it turns, does it stay for long?",
  "Do you know anything about fan noise on 258V?",
  "During typical office work I'm not hearing the fan at all. The lowest fan setting is also barely audible. \nBecause the lunar lake chips are tuned to be energy efficient they don't generate a lot of heat. \n\n\nI just ran a few CPU benchmarks and found out that while running on battery there are rather strict limits on power, so even during a (admittedly short) high load, it doesn't get very hot or loud. During the entire benchmark the CPU temps never exceeded 70°C, fan on medium. \n\nIf plugged in it gets louder and hotter, in return for almost double the score in 3D Mark. And still quieter than some other laptops.\n\n\nIf its charging the fan is more likely to turn on, I'm guessing because charging also produces heat.",
  "Thanks, those user reports are very important to me, and other people sensitive to noise since revies often ommits fan behaviour. \n\nAnd what power modes did you use for the tests? I wonder if for example power saver+plugged on AC will be noisy, since you stated if plugged it gets hoter. That has obvious explanation for the new design of fast charging PSU, unfortunate in modern latops.",
  "Lenovo Ideapad slim 3 gen 10 AMD 14\" So i bought this laptop for £469 in the UK for university and i have had it for about a week now and I have not seen any reviews so i thought i would leave a review. It has a ryzen 5 8640hs with integrated radeon graphics, 16gb ram dual channel and a 60wh battery\n\nBuild quality: This laptop is made of sturdy plastic, the finish feels very nice but it is nothing to boast about, it is good enough for the price. I like how it is very lightweight and is really easy to carry around.\n\nDisplay: The anti-glare coating is great for this and really helps when it is sunny outside and the sun is very bright. 1920x1200 is very sharp but other than that its a regular 60hz IPS panel but it definitely gets the job done.\n\nKeyboard: This one does not come with a full size keyboard but I am not too bothered by this personally as I dont usually use the rest of the other keys. Sometimes I do press the wrong keys but once you get used to it, its a solid keyboard.\n\nPerformance: The CPU in this is very fast, whatever I do happens in an instant whether im video editing, watching videos, playing games or in a meeting. The 16gb ram also plays a huge role in this. What surprised me the most was the performance of the GPU considering its only 15W. I dont play very heavy games but this GPU was able to run forza horizon 4, fortnite, GTA, battlefield 1 and hollow Knight at good fps(these are the games I usually play). I also did some wii u emulation and it was flawless. One thing I will mention is that the laptop can be quite noisy when gaming on extreme performance mode but is very quiet when not being pushed.\n\nBattery: The battery on this is great for what it is. I was able to achieve around 7-8 hours from 100 percent to 20 whilst just doing my assignments(on battery saver). I got around 5-6 hours on netflix. When gaming the max i got was around 3 hours of battery life which is not too bad.",
  "wow thanks for this review! I was thinking of getting this laptops but couldn't find a lot of reviews so thanks <3",
  "Nice review, I just bought the version with AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS with dual RAM of 8 GB each. I hope I don't regret it, but the price of €630 seemed very advantageous to me honestly",
  "How good an idea is it to get this same version but with 24GB of RAM for $800? Considering that I live in Chile and our prices tend to be higher than those in first-world countries.",
  "Hi! Thanks for the review. Do you think it's worth getting the Ryzen 78840HS version for 40€ more?? I'm gonna be using it for university work. Music production software and other music related software and some gaming",
  "Hi, I am interested of this Laptop, i.e. the 8840HS variant, supports DP alt mode 1.4 on the USB-C port.",
  "I know it's an old post but how is the laptop holding up so far ?",
  "Hi I’ve had this laptop for over a month now and it’s been pretty good thus far but have a few issues/concerns and wanted to see if others are having! 1. The trackpad is not good my fingers dont move on it well and it doesn’t feel sturdy it feels pretty cheap. 2. I might of banged it at some stage but I noticed with the display when it shows black things the pixels are blue in a certain spot only a little you can barely notice it but it bothers me.",
  "No problem its a great laptop for its price, still going strong right now",
  "How is the battery?",
  "As far as I'm aware the \"24GB\" version doesn't exist, it can just support up to 24GB, as in you need to buy extra memory and install it yourself. If that's 800USD that's a disgusting price. Are Apple products also more expensive there? Personally I'd be looking into an Air M4 for that price.",
  "Dont get it, its not worth it at that price point",
  "Absolutely, that ryzen 7 is quite a bit faster and will be better for running multiple tasks, the igpu on it is slightly faster than the ryzen 5 one by about 10%. For €40 more yeah i would say its worth it",
  "Cant really say but its most likely similar to this one but with a stronger gpu and cpu",
  "Its holding up great the battery and performance is still good",
  "In reality it has yet to arrive, they're taking a long time to ship and maybe I'm changing my mind, opting for a thinkpad for €100 more though",
  "Hi, this I assume. Does your model support DP Alt Mode 1.4?",
  "I can buy the slim 3, witht he ryzen 7 only 16gb ram and 60Wh battery for £466, worth ?",
  "ciao, potresti fare un aggiornamento? quale PC hai preso alla fine? a che thinkpad stavi pensando? ti trovi bene?",
  "Whats that",
  "Yeah thats worth it",
  "This is the standard describing how video signals are sent over the USB-C port. ",

I went with the Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition (Gen 9) with the Core Ultra 7 258V CPU, purchased directly from Lenovo’s website.\n\nIn Australia, I had the option to upgrade to an **OLED display**, but I intentionally chose IPS instead. While OLED is great, it comes with the risk of burn-in, and since I plan to use this laptop primarily for productivity tasks like Office apps, browsing, coding, I didn’t want to constantly worry about screen longevity. With an IPS display I am not surrendering too much for 1 less headache I have to worry about.\n\nI note that OLED has its time and place - but really depends on what you want to do with it",

  "Impression + AMA - Core Ultra 7 258v VS Ryzen 7 AI 350 for a casual user (feat. Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Gen 10) Hello there! Just a quick introduction to explain why I'm making this post: I'm currently in the market for a new laptop (coming from a Blade 14 2021 w/ RTX 3070). Here are my requirements:\n\n* Thin and light\n* Decent battery life (doesn't need to exceed 10 hours)\n* Most importantly, good unplugged performance\n* Casual gaming (mostly indies)\n* Quiet and at least not hot to the touch\n\nMy Typical Usage:\n\n**Two Browsers** – about 20–30 tabs each\n\n* **Browser 1** – TradingView, multiple crypto trading exchanges\n* **Browser 2** – Messenger, WhatsApp, X, Telegram, Discord, Databricks, Reddit, YouTube, Chatgpt etc.\n\n**Other apps (background + foreground)** – Spotify, Outlook, Teams, ShareX, OneDrive, Steam, Excel spreadsheets (2–3 at least)\n\nSo, I narrowed my choice down to the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7, but I have a big dilemma due to the CPU choice—Intel 258v vs. AMD AI 350. Naturally, being an AMD fanboy, I would have picked the AI 350 without question, especially since AMD has usually been the battery champ in Windows laptops over the past few years. After doing further research into Lunar Lake, I'm very intrigued by its efficiency but wary about the lack of multithreading.\n\nThe problem is that there isn't a review out there that really focuses on actual unplugged user experience in terms of performance and multitasking. Most reviewers dish out raw numbers like everyone is a content creator or something. Sure, user experience is rather hard to quantify, but I need a laptop that feels smooth in daily use.\n\nTherefore, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I went to my local retailer and ordered both models. They just arrived today, so now I have the AMD model with a touchscreen in Tidal Teal and the Intel model without a touchscreen in Lunar Grey. After setting them up and playing around for a few hours, here are my early impressions (mind you, these are not scientific results).\n\n**Performance (Unplugged) – Nitpick Alert**\n\nNo, I don't run benchmark scores—you can find those online easily. I care more about actual system responsiveness: how the laptop feels in day-to-day use and under light loads.\n\n**Intel 258v** – To my surprise, the 258v delivers much better responsiveness. I'm talking about switching windows, animations, moving things around the screen, having multiple windows open, and running background apps during my typical workload. Additionally, it’s able to handle everything I need without a single lag—I even had a 4K YouTube video playing in a floating window while working. Even in 'Best Power Efficiency' mode, the scrolling animations remain smooth, which is a nice touch. Sure, my workload isn’t the heaviest, but this is an ace in my book. One thing to note: I started noticing slight sluggishness in animations when the battery falls below 15%.\n\n**AMD AI 350** – While the AI 350 can also do everything without slowing down, the general animations aren't as smooth as the 258v’s when unplugged. Things like minimizing/maximizing windows and bringing up the quick menu feel less fluid. This is particularly noticeable in 'Best Power Efficiency' mode, where I lose the smooth scrolling animation while charting on TradingView. It’s not bad or slow per se—it works fine—it’s just that the 258v keeps things consistently smooth across all settings.\n\nI'll run some games during the weekend and see how it goes. However, gaming performance is not my main requirement—nice to have, but not a must-have. You can find plenty of benchmarks online anyway.\n\n**Noise & Heat**\n\nAnother win here for the 258v. Aside from the initial setup, the fan rarely ramps up. While running my typical workload, it gets just a little warm at the top left corner of the keyboard—not bothersome at all. Otherwise, it remains cool and quiet. \n\nThe AMD AI 350 also fares pretty well—it gets *slightly* warmer than the 258v, but I'd say it's negligible. The fan kicks in more often than the Intel 258v’s, though. However, I'd say both can achieve silent performance.\n\n**Battery Life**\n\nToo early to tell, as I haven't gone through a full battery cycle on either laptop yet. First impressions suggest both are neck and neck. I'll update the post once I have more results.\n\n**Build Quality**\n\nNormally, they should be the same, but I noticed a few differences worth reporting. The AI 350 has some backplate creaks—it makes a slight noise when picking the laptop up or moving the lid. Meanwhile, the 258v feels more solid, but it has a rattly touchpad, which kind of drives me nuts at times. Lenovo's QC seems poor here.\n\nI find this surprising since I usually hear Lenovo has the fewest RMA cases—or maybe I just have the worst luck.\n\nAs of now, the Intel 258v is more likely to stay with me. I'll update this post once I have more testing results. **AMA!**",
  "Well, the Intel Is Better in every category except multi core performance, battery Life Will be mutch Better(around 15% more), if you want tò go amd with some reason tò not go with Intel you should get a ryzen 9 365, or if you do not care using Intel the ultra 7 258v or if you want also multicolore performance (loosing the bonus battery Life ) the 255h",
  "I'm having the same experience as you with a new AMD AI 350 Laptop (HP OmniBook X) that for some reason doesn't feel as smooth for casual use which is surprising coming from a Ryzen 5 5600H as reference.  I'm not sure if it's the HP bloatware and I should try a fresh windows install before returning. \n\n\nI'm getting in the meantime a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i with the Core Ultra 7 258v so I will be able to compare between those.",
  "I'm thinking about whether it's worth paying $200 more for the 258V?",
  "I'm planning to upgrade from my Lenovo with a 5500U because it's starting to feel a bit slow in everyday use nothing heavy, mostly just browsing. I was leaning towards AMD for the performance, but your comparison really got me thinking, and now I'm considering the 258v. Did you end up keeping it? How’s it been after using it for a while?",
  "Hey mate, what did you notice with the battery life?",
  "Any updates on the battery life?^^",
  "How did it go?",
  "I guess this really depends if you need that 32GB. As far as I know, there isnt too much CPU performance different wbeen 256v vs 258v but yeah the price different is rather steep.  \nPersonally, I only upgrade my laptop like after 5 years or when it dies, so 32GB could futureproof'' things down the road for me.",
  "Ended up getting a HP Omnibook Ultra with the Intel 258V. So far way smoother experience than the Omnibook X with the AI 350 for some reason even though the specs of the AMD sounded better. The Yoga Slim 7i was equally smooth experience when I tried but found a great deal on the HP.",
  "Sorry, I meant that I'm also looking at the Lenovo Yoga 7i and the Intel version with the 258V is $200 more than the Ryzen 7 AI 350.",
  "And how is the battery in comparison?",
  "sorry i misunderstood your question.  \npersonally I would, considering Im only mostly doing light but moderate multitasking, I dont need that extra horsepower considering the 258v has plenty for me.\n\nMoreover, the extra battery life, silence and lower temp gives a nice feeling.\n\nBut anyway, I've returned both of the laptop due to build quality issue.\n\nI've just picked a 2024 Omnibook Ultra Flip 14 on sales, 10% less than what I paid for the yoga 7 258v, which has way better build quality. However, the Yoga has better screen quality though as the screendoor effect on the HP is crazy.",
  "Hye, any update on the battery life comparison? Did you test it out completely before returning them?",
  "yes please any battery life updates? what are your thoughts",

  "help deciding between lenovo yoga 7 ryzen 7, lenovo yoga slim 7i and lenovo yoga slim 7i aura edition hello! ill hopefully be going to university this september and I'm looking to buy a decently well-built, durable laptop that can last me the whole 3 years of my course and maybe some time after that. \n\nmy budget is between £850 - £950. can't really go over that..\n\n2 of my friends have the lenovo yoga 7i and they're enjoying it a lot but im not 100% sold on it because I've heard mixed reviews, especially about the hinges.

  "definitely the yoga slim 7i aura edition from lenovos website \n\nit would have the best battery life and igpu out of all these. the core ultra 226v and the 200v series processors are REALLY good at everything. tlou2 and rdr might be fine, if i remember correctly it should be fine at 1080 low/medium. search for some gaming benchmarks on youtube for this. roblox/valorant/ow should be fine \n\nonly problem is 16gb of ram which might struggle in gaming but for everything else itll be fine. the oled screen will be really nice for watching movies",
  "ooh okay, thank you!!\n\nin the specs of the slim 7i aura, it says 16GB (memory on package) instead of (soldered)\ndoes this mean i would be able to change the memory to 32GB? i don't actually know how to do this yet, but would that be possible?\n\nalso, is it worth getting any security software (norton) or should i just leave that",

  "nooo dont get norton, windows defender is perfectly fine\n\nand no sadly the ram isnt upgradeable. with the new core ultra chips, the ram is soldered (memory on package is another way of saying it), so that the ram has higher speeds=better performance especially for the igpu\n\nand clicking on the build your pc option, it seems like we cant even get 32gb which sucks\n\nthe only option with 32gb ram is the core ultra 7 258v, which seems like it is an extra 110 in total. if youre willing to spend that much, its gonna be worth it (better cpu and gpu performance+more ram).",

However, given the Acer's reputation on overheating and its  build, Im thinking twice if I should take a risk on Acer Swift 14 AI, given this is one of their latest premium models (released 2024).

  "Review of Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 (15in, 16gb, 512gb SSD, AMD Ryzen 5700u) I bought the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 (15in, 16gb, 512gb SSD, AMD Ryzen 5700u) in India. Here is my review about it after using it for about 2 weeks.\n\n**Build:**\n\n* Update after 14 months (16 Oct 2022): Shit quality hinge. Broke twice till now without ever dropping the laptop.\n* Full plastic build. Metal Lid. Matte finish. Feels great and solid.\n* Keyboard and touchpad are great\n\n**General things:**\n\n1. Initially I had some problem with the speakers when they would stop working and I had to restart the laptop to fix. I got a driver update a couple days later, haven't had that same problem since.\n2. The fingerprint can be a hit or miss sometimes due to its design, I then added my fingerprint from multiple angles so mostly works but sometimes have to try again.\n3. My unit had some backlight bleed on the bottom right corner noticeable when in a dimly lit room at above 70% brightness. Not a problem for me since I dim the screen to around 30% in the dark. This will vary by laptop though.\n4. I have a problem with OBS recordings. It seems that OBS is recording at same volume as windows master volume. I haven't been able to find a fix for it. Every program I tried which captures audio from speakers to record/broadcast (OBS, XSlit, Anydesk) have the same issue.  **(EDIT: FIX: Roll Back Realtek (R) Audio drivers so that the manufacturer is Microsoft, Dolby audio will stop working though if you do it. Not recommended.)**\n5. The product description states that it has Bluetooth 5.0 but the device manager says its Bluetooth 5.1.\n\n**Expandability**:\n\nI opened mine up coz of curiosity. The internal design is the same as last years version.\n\n1. The RAM is soldered in dual channel. (Task Manager)\n2. There is one M.2 NVME SSD slot which is already populated with the 512 GB SSD.\n3. There is a space for an HDD but it doesn't come with the SATA cable installed, the SATA cable will need to be purchased separately to install a hard drive within the laptop.\n4. The laptop comes with WI-FI 5 and not WI-FI 6 unlike last years version. The WI-FI card is upgradable if you need WIFI 6.\n5. The internal battery can also be upgraded to 70 Whrs version. However note that if you do upgrade, it will occupy the HDD slot aswell.\n\nLink to Lenovo's Spare parts website of this model. [IdeaPad 5 ALC05 Type 92LN Spare parts](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/in/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/5-series/ideapad-5-15alc05/82ln/parts/display/compatible)\n\n**Battery life estimates from 100 percent battery (70% brightness):**\n\n1. Watching movies (Chrome with 5 extensions - 1 tab open, discord, telegram, anydesk, Battery saving mode active from Vantage software, Better battery saving mode in windows.) - 9hrs\n2. Moderate Multi tasking (Listening to music, actually using chrome, discord, qbittorrent (downloading) and a bunch of other background programs, Battery saving mode from Vantage software, Better battery saving mode in windows.) - 6 to 7 hrs\n\n* Note: I use my laptop on conservation mode all the time so it charges only to 60%. The battery life is based on the time it take to drain the laptop from 60% to around 30% and multiplying that by 3.\n* The conservation mode is not customizable. Its either 60% charge or 100% charge.\n* Also, I absolutely love the conservation mode, ~~no other brands have this~~ Asus and Dell also have it according to the internet. My laptop remains on the desk most of the time so I don't have to worry about it remaining on 100% all the time.\n\n**Fans (In an air conditioned room)**\n\n* On Battery- The laptop fans are completely off when watching movies. They may or may not turn on when multi tasking.\n* Plugged in- The fans only turned off when set to Battery Saving Mode in Vantage and doing light tasks.\n* Fans are inaudible (if they do turn on) when doing basic tasks in a room with air conditioner running, only slightly audible with the air conditioner off.\n\n**iGPU**:\n\n* Out of the 16gb ram, 2GB is dedicated for the iGPU, this can be changed in BIOS to 1GB or 512 MB.\n\n**Lenovo Power Management modes:**\n\n* Extreme Performance- TDP is 35 Watts.\n* Intelligent Cooling- TDP is 25 Watts.\n* Battery Saving Mode- TDP is 15 Watts.\n* On Battery, change to best performance (windows) and these modes function the same as plugged in.  I did notice that Battery Saver Mode (Vantage) turns on the fans later than the Intelligent cooling mode which is I guess nice if you're trying to save battery.\n\n**Performance Benchmarks (Plugged in)(Extreme Performance):**\n\n* **Cinnebench R23**\n   * Multi Core **-** 9655 points, 3.65 GHz across all cores, Max: 85 C, Power: 35 W\n   * Single Core **-** 1245 points, 4.3 Ghz single core, Max: 70 C, Power: 10 W\n* **Crystal DiskMark-** 2481 MB/s Read, 1726 MB/s Write\n\n**Performance Benchmarks on battery:**\n\nThe laptop can achieve full performance on battery as well, change from Better Battery mode to Best performance mode in the Windows battery settings.\n\n**Note:** On battery, Better Battery (and Battery Saver) mode locks the CPU at base clock of 1.8 Ghz to get maximum battery life. While using this mode, I did not suffer any hanging when doing casual tasks, (Web browsing, YouTube, Discord etc.)\n\nIf you wanna know something else about it. Please let me know. I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.\n\n* EDIT #1: Added Benchmarks.\n* EDIT #2: Photo of the internals. [https://imgur.com/a/5WCUKW4](https://imgur.com/a/5WCUKW4)\n   * Disassembly video from YouTube (not the exactly same model): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKF\\_9L1qfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKF_9L1qfY)\n* EDIT #3, #4: Added battery benchmarks, then deleted them because I tested them on Better battery mode which locks the clock speed to 1.8Ghz.\n* Edit #5: Cleaned up the post.\n   * Update as of 8 Sept 2021: I have been having some weird touchpad problem. [Details here](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-IdeaPad-1xx-3xx-5xx-7xx-Edge-LaVie-Z-Flex-Notebooks/Touchpad-sluggish-Latency-Lag/m-p/5095310). This has not been fixed after a touchpad replacement so currently working on it. The issue does seem isolated to just me though.\n* Edit #6: Update as of 16 Oct 2022: The hinge is shit quality, it has broken twice till now in the exact same manner with completely normal use.",
  "I can confirm that the hinge quality is garbage. I use mine almost entirely at home, after 2 years of use I have used it no more than 30 times outside. I very rarely open and close the lid when I use it at home because I can sense right from the beginning the hinge quality is not the best although I did not expect it to be this bad. And yet the hinge broke! Together with the LCD!\n\nI paid RM170 (around 39 USD) just to get the one time on site repair because they said repair at the depot would take around 2 weeks time and I had no spare laptop. The basic, send in to the depot warranty covered the spare parts, luckily. So if you guys are planning to buy this model, **do consider to upgrade to the onsite warranty to 3 or 4 years** (depending on how long you plan to use the device). \n\nThe technician who came even told me this model and the model 3 are plagued with this problem. 7 and thinkpads fair better. I wish I'd known.\n\nPerformance wise, it is amazing. Still running strong after two years. (I open many tabs on Edge daily, at times 30-50 tabs, rarely any hiccup.) i5 11 gen, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Heat management is superb as well. It heats up but never overheat, not once.\n\nCheers,  \nR.",
  "Thank you for the review! This is by far the most comprehensive one I've read about this laptop as it's just been released.\n\nI have a few questions-\n1. Do you notice a significant drop in performance (general multi tasking) when on battery vs plugged in?\n2. Does the 100% screen brightness hold up in well-lit rooms or under the sun?\n3. How was the initial set-up process like? Did you install any specific programs/drivers that helped?",
  "Thankx for the review, based on it I will no more 'struggle' with choosing a new laptop from Lenovo, I got a bit scared haha. I'm gonna carry on with my HP's. They have not failed me yet, and I have been happy with performances so far. :)",
  "**Beware: Major Touchpad Problem**\n\nI bought a Lenovo Ideapad Silm 5 laptop in Aug 23, and I thought all is well until a few months in. My touchpad stopped functioning but thankfully, the onsite warranty allowed me to change my motherboard. A few months down the road, the same issue arose, and I was told by the customer hotline to undergo numerous upgrading of software, restarting of laptop, etc, and the touchpad would mysteriously function after a months/weeks until it breaks down again. This laptop is reaching its 1 year mark, and the same issue still persists. It has been a major inconvenience, especially since a mouse cannot entirely replace the functions of the touchpad (i.e. pinching in/out to enlarge the text). To my dismay, I was told by the onsite warranty engineer that the touchpad issue is rampant in laptops of this particular model. I asked for an upgrade of my laptop or replacement of another model, but I was told that this was not Lenovo's usual practice. Am still monitoring the issue after the engineer has replaced the touchpad (for second time), but if anything, **please do not purchase this model** unless you are willing to forgo its touchpad.\n\nTrust me, their onsite warranty they provide is not worth in exchange for your sanity if you were to constantly experience the same issue. The warranty team somehow does not understand what \"intermittent issue\" mean, and they'll put you through the arduous process of troubleshooting and restarting, only for you to find yourself back to square one.\n\nP.S. My USB ports were also not working, but it's fixed atm.",

Cause right now, it is 68k INR. And is it worth the price?\n\n\nHow is the cooling on this laptop? Does it heat up under medium-heavy loads? Especially without air conditioning.\n\n\nDoes it stutter or lag a bit when you launch an app or open a web browser or type? Especially when on battery?\n\n\n\nI tried the Intel model for the Ideapad which apparently uses the same body and parts as the Ryzen 5700U model. I did not find the keyboard and the touchpad as good as I was expecting (but I could be wrong cause I only tried it for a few seconds). \n\n\nIs the battery replaceable/ easily removeable by the user? Or does one have to take it to a service center?\n\nI was also considering the HP laptops with Ryzen 5500U but the 15in (my preferred screen size) has a TN panel while the 14in does have IPS but is glossy (I need antiglare so it doesn't strain my eyes).\n\n\nThe Ideapad 5 and Legion 5 just seem so much better.",

Would I see a major difference in battery drain and temperature, if I turn on Extreme Performance in BIOS but Balanced mode on Windows?\n\nAlso, does it make any sense to do this for gaming purposes? Because if you're going to play while the system is AC wired the TDP would be higher than 25W anyways, am I right?",

  "Hi,\n\n1. The performance drop is not noticeable doing casual tasks on battery vs plugged in. Tried loading web pages and video playback. 4k60fps video playback is smooth on both. \n2. 100% screen brightness definitely holds up in a well lit room, I cam easily manage at 70% brightness in my room. This is probably the best you'll get in this price range, most competition only offer 250 nit screens while this is a 300 nit screen.\n3. Set-up process is pretty classic for windows. The only bloatware was McAfee which I promptly uninstalled. I found once that Lenovo Voice assistant was using 50% of the CPU (it may be updating), so uninstalled that as well. As for driver updates, Lenovo Vantage software is great, check for system updates and install the updated audio drivers from there.",

  "I didn't really have a preference, absolutely wanted to get 16GBs of RAM but the 14 inch version only offers 8Gb of soldered memory. There is only a 200g difference between the two, so didn't make a difference.\n\nPlus the extra HDD slot might be a nice benefit in the future.",

  "IdeaPad 5 is still a good option for 68k. \n\nApart from this, Asus K15 Oled with 5500U, 8GB seems like a sweet deal at 58k on Flipkart during sale. Downsides would be 8Gb of RAM and a 42Whr battery. The ram is expandable to maximum of 12 or 16 gb idk. If you can look past the smaller battery, it has a freaking Oled. You might be able to get some extra battery life by using dark mode because of the Oled display.",
  "No need to go into BIOS to change performance mode, you can just change them from within windows with Lenovo Vantage. Or press Fn+Q\n\n***About the second question:-***      \nWhile AC is connected windows power modes don't really do much so you can ignore them. Between the three windows power modes there is very little difference in terms of CPU power usage (maybe 1W difference between each mode).\n\nBIOS performance modes behave exactly the same both on battery and AC. Which means TDP limits will be the same on both AC and battery. Which means if the game demands more than 25W sustained power, Intelligent cooling mode will limit performance.\n\n***About the first question:***\n\n**Under low load:-**   \nThe difference in battery life will only be caused by the fact that extreme performance mode likes to enable the fans even under very light load.\n\n**Under moderate load:-**    \nThere should be no difference for battery life and heat output in between the different BIOS power modes or windows power modes.\n\nThe reason why low and moderate load don't cause significant differences in battery life between the different power modes because the CPU only uses as much power as it needs, it is not going to consume more power if the program itself doesn't require it.\n\n**For heavy load:**\n\n**If using better battery mode (windows):**    \nThere should again be no difference in between any of the BIOS power modes.\n\n**If using better performance or best performance mode (windows):**     \nThere will be lesser battery life and greater heat output in Intelligent cooling mode compared to Battery saving mode. The difference would be greater in Extreme performance mode. However, you will also be getting better performance.",

  "Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5i VS Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 I got 2 laptops from Lenovo on sale to compare them before deciding which to get.\n\nIdeaPad Slim 5i: 646$ after tax\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS w/ Radeon 780M Graphics 3.8 GHz\n\nYoga Slim 7: 1046$ after tax\n\n* Intel Core Ultra 7 256V 2.20GHz w/ Intel Arc 140V GPU (8GB)\n\n  \nFrom all the reviews of the Yoga Slim 7, I've seen that the iGPU for the Ultra 7 256V (Intel Arc 140V) should be a great one and a much better improvement on previous iGPUs. They also run games on it and it works pretty well (but they usually use the 258V which has the same GPU).\n\nFrom testing however, I found that the AMD one is performing much better. I'm using Fortnite as a comparison/reference: AMD was able to run smoothly with Medium preset settings while the Intel one quite literally blue screened me and crashed the laptop twice. Eventually I got it to work, but at less than 30fps while the AMD one held \\~60fps or more.

Is this something with the settings or drivers (I updated all drivers)? I made sure both screens had the same refresh rate and resolution for a fair comparison too. Both laptops' battery lives are equivalent and the only difference between the two is that the Yoga has a really good display. I'm kinda lost here.

  "ASUS TUF A15, Lenovo LOQ 15 or Lenovo Legion Slim 5 with slightly lower specs? I’m an architecture student, I want a budget-friendly gaming laptop that is strong for renders and 3D softwares, also I don’t own a PS5 or a next-gen gaming console, which might be the case for a long while, so I want a laptop that also performs well in games. I currently have 3 options that I cannot decide between:\n\n1-ASUS TUF A15 Ryzen 7 7735hs RTX 4060 8gb VRAM 1080p 144hz\n\n2-Lenovo LOQ 15 intel i7 13620h RTX 4060 8gb 1080p 144hz\n\n3-Lenovo Legion Slim 5 intel i7 13700h RTX 4050 6gb VRAM 2K display 165hz\n\nThe ASUS is the cheapest, with both the LOQ and the Legion being equally priced. I went to a store and asked one of the workers there about the ASUS and told me so many good stuff about it compared to the LOQ, such as the cooling system and build quality, but watching reviews on this model of ASUS, all comments on it are kinda mixed which makes me scared of getting it, I’m more convinced about getting the LOQ because I heard it has a better display which is something that strongly matters to me. \n\nAs for the Legion, I heard that it’s the BEST budget gaming laptop there is, though considering that it’s gpu is 4050 instead of 4060, it makes me scared of regretting my purchase, since 4060 is significantly better than the 4050.\n\nSorry for all of this text, but I would love some advice, if it is based on personal experience that would be a lot better, but all suggestions are welcome, thanks! :))\n\n",
  "I'd do the LOQ or the Legion in your scenario. I know they're promising to be better but the ASUS support stories still scare the shit out of me.

I am happy if I can watch movies (Netflix & downloaded), manage 15+ tabs while browsing and play some lightweight games (like Hearthstone) while traveling, obviously I wouldn't mind playing some more demanding games but it's just a bonus. I don't do any video editing or anything like that. I would use it mostly for the things mentioned and work related tasks which is mostly trading via web browser.\n\nI can not upgrade anything on the Macbook Air version without getting outside of my budget. I would have looked at Macbook pro 14 m1 if I had US prices, alas I do not.\n\nI really like the design/look of the M2 and the fact that it has a long battery life. Since I also handle sensitive data I like that Mac inherently have less malwares going around and being developed to target them (even though that number is steadily increasing). It also feels like less of hassle when on the go, lighter, won't have to always bring a charger if I know I have a full charge when heading somewhere etc. My concern is that 8 gb of ram will be pushing it even for non heavy workload stuff (I heard conflicting things, as a PC user 8gb ram sounds like nothing in 2023 tbh) as well as being shoehorned into not ever doing anything demanding would the need arise (I really can't think of anything myself on the spot though).\n\nThe Lenovo clearly is a stronger machine (not in all, but most areas) and since I am a PC guy it's slightly more intuitive to use (I have a Macbook pro from 2015 and honestly, I never found it very confusing when I used it either). Another positive is that I can simply transfer a lot of the stuff I need from my desktop, mostly a convenience thing though. I have tried my best to find reliable reviews of the Lenovo as specced above but they are rare to find, I am concerned that the battery life would be a disappointment.\n\nI am a Android user so I won't be syncing anything with the Macbook if that is a consideration at all.\n\nAny advice or just ideas that could tip me in either directions would be great.

All laptops were running minimal background programs, plugged in, and set to the 'Best Performance' Windows power mode. I haven't adjusted any TDP settings or undervolted anything.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 4700U and i7-1065G7 both crush multi-core tasks compared to the entry-level 10th gen i5.  While 4700U single-core performance is very comparable across the three latest chips, it is an undisputed winner in multi-core tests. It's crazy how far computing power has come - the 4700U is over 5x as fast as the old i5-3427U!\n\n[CPU Benchmark Scores](https://preview.redd.it/tnx8rsmhjl151.png?width=1089&format=png&auto=webp&s=473ac2c5dbc977afb15c8cdfe549f9308b04bafd)\n\nI ran Cinebench R20 multi-core tests back-to-back to get a sense of the steady state output. The 4700U does drop 16% from a peak score of 3189 but still has over a 50% edge on the i7-1065G7.\n\n[Cinebench R20 Multi-Core Runs in a loop](https://preview.redd.it/90ylvczjjl151.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=2797a6c4c5dd8e5b7f2f44b330db09637e9d70fe)\n\nThe integrated Radeon graphics on the Ryzen 7 4700U is supposedly Vega 7, but I didn't see that specified anywhere. Nevertheless, this was a comparison I was excited to do because of the curiosity around how the Radeon graphics stack up to Ice Lake and separately a dedicated entry-level NVIDIA MX250.\n\n[GPU Benchmark Scores](https://preview.redd.it/qwvzaoomjl151.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c6051fc635579017d31e0ede02ce0be0f562770)\n\nLastly, I used Novabench to gauge speeds on the RAM and disk. It seems like the Slim 7 has the more premium configuration and parts (LPDDR4X at higher MHz).\n\n[RAM + Disk Benchmark Scores](https://preview.redd.it/yu56pbdojl151.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=77982e67ac1b50499c63548ca0b37aaf74894f56)\n\n# Ideapad Slim 7 vs. 5 Display Comparison\n\nInitial reviews of the Ideapad Slim 5 have been largely positive other than the display quality and brightness. I don't consider display brightness an important factor as I typically work on the lowest brightness settings all the time. However, I was curious to see the difference between 60% sRGB and 100% sRGB because I do video/photo editing from time to time.\n\nBelow are a few comparisons of the Ideapad 5 (left) and Ideapad Slim 7 (right) screens at max and min brightness. Having used each device for a couple days, I do appreciate the color accuracy of the Slim 7 a lot, but I prefer having an anti-glare screen over a glossy one.\n\n[Ideapad 5 \\(left\\) vs. Ideapad Slim 7 \\(right\\) in the desktop view at max brightness](https://preview.redd.it/bluvfvzrjl151.png?width=2568&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ff576eea4dc66a8532f9e1fb3d39498dba9d5b4)\n\n[Ideapad 5 \\(left\\) vs. Ideapad Slim 7 \\(right\\) with a random picture at max brightness](https://preview.redd.it/95gnxayvjl151.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7eaf22d5060bd69a5dc0baccdc8c0d10ed832d)\n\n[Ideapad 5 \\(left\\) vs. Ideapad Slim 7 \\(right\\) with a random picture at min brightness](https://preview.redd.it/ucmlu9dyjl151.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e688ef20e4dcce8628ad85cabc7ea3b6f725ade)\n\n# Other Thoughts\n\n**Acer Aspire 5**\n\nThe A515-54G-53H6 felt like a decent deal for the price and specs. Supposedly, I could have upgraded the RAM from 2x4 GB to 20 GB, but I never opened up the internals. The fan was surprisingly loud during idle and web browsing, and the battery life of 7-8 hrs on idle definitely left more to be desired. The dimensions felt a bit large for a 15.6\" and the construction felt ok, just not super solid.\n\n**Lenovo Ideapad Slim 7**\n\nThis felt like a premium laptop right away. The fan came on during light games and benchmarking, but didn't seem too loud in a quiet room. The two USB-Cs + Thunderbolt 3 are definitely a great feature and left me spoiled once I received the Ideapad 5. The laptop did feel a bit heavy at 4.1 lbs and the nice metal finish seemed to scratch easily, although you can buff out minor ones.\n\nI would have kept this machine if it had an anti-glare screen and if there weren't a substantial price difference vs. the Ideapad 5. I don't think I would notice 4700U vs. i7-1065G7 performance differences in real world use that much.\n\n**Lenovo Ideapad 5**\n\nAfter using the Slim 7, this laptop felt like more of a budget choice. The bezels aren't as razor thin and elegantly trimmed. The trackpad has a greater click depression that makes it feel cheaper. Otherwise, as other reviews have mentioned, the build quality is surprisingly good. I'm perfectly happy with this given the effective price that I got it at. I also prefer the portability of the 14\" over premium features such as an IR camera. This is a strong upgrade over my Dell Latitude 6430u and I would be happy to keep this for the next few years!",
  "The Ideapad Slim 7 looks good! But it would much better with the Ryzen 7 4700U from the Ideapad 5",
  "Thank you for this post!",
  "Does the IdeaPad Slim 7 support Tb3 or data transfer on both ports? Based on the psref it seems one of the usb-c only does power delivery and doesn't carry data?\n\nThank you.",
  "I'm happy with the same model you had at the $750 price point I got it at but I would be much more excited if I could just swap the processor for a 4700U and keep the 16GB of RAM.",
  "The psref is right, the back USB-C is for charging only.",
  "If you’re talking about the Slim 7, then yeah, you’re in the same boat with lots of people!",
  "That's really silly and a waste of a perfectly good port... No idea why there is no true successor for the 720s and S730 13 inch...",
  "Yes the Slim 7. Like a lot of others have commented, it almost seems like Lenovo is intentionally trying to pin AMD into the \"budget\" category by relegating it to a much lower price point and only 8GB of RAM. I saw the 14\" Slim 7 with 4700U/8GB/512GB for $769 on pre-order at Adorama (they just removed it apparently). It makes no sense because the 4700U is like 75% faster in multi and the GPU is 20%+ faster than the 1065G7 with lower TDP. Intel still gets better Super Pi 1M scores though, so that's something hahaha.  \n\nI'm not sure you're right about the Slim 7 1065G7 having a $905 MSRP. I think that was a sale price and MSRP is still $1200ish.",
  "Yes you’re right, the Slim 7 i7-1065G7 full price is $1200, but the release batch had promotional pricing at $905 until it sold out.\n\nIt looks like the Slim 7 14” AMD is finally out, but just with an 8 GB configuration and with no promotional pricing. I have no idea why they would pair 4700U with 16 GB in the 5 line, but not the 7. The 4800U would be the real jewel, and with this release strategy and the pandemic, who knows when that might be",
  "Pretty late to the party but did you seriously get the 4700U slim 7 for $769? It's currently [$899](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-700-series/IdeaPad-Slim-7-14ARE05/p/88IPS701400) at Lenovo's website right now and I feel like paying that much would be a ripoff compared to yours!",
  "No I got the 15.6\"/i7 1065G7/16GB/512GB for $750, and I said I saw the 4700/8GB/512GB for $769 on Adorama before they took the product page down.",
  "Ah I see. Thanks! How do you like the build quality of the Slim 7? Is it one of the cheaper feeling metal devices or is it something that feels really premium? How's the display? Battery life? I'm probably going to purchase it in a week or two (if it's available) and would like to know your general take on it as well if you don't mind. I'll be getting the model with the Ryzen 7 for $899 (before I apply student discount).",
  "Feels mid-high-tier. Very similar to the C940 except the hinge design uses more plastic (cheaper). The 15.6\" version definitely feels like a $1000+ laptop, but if you look very closely you can tell the tolerances in manufacturing are worse than in more premium devices like the XPS, i.e. small gaps or asymmetries in the chassis, and the plastic hinge is a bit of a bummer. The Slim 7 still looks and feels better than anything HP/Acer/others have on offer in the price range currently.",
  "Thank you for the insight! I'm not looking for XPS build quality but just something that is a good step up from plastic and feels pretty sturdy for college. Hopefully this fits the bill!",
  "Yeah man. I can only attest to the 1080p 15.6\" Intel one. The display is over 300 nits and looks really good, but having a brighter display would definitely be better. The one thing I wish it had that the C940 has is that brighter 400 nit display. Guess that's Lenovo's way of establishing that the Slim 7 is in its premium but still mid-range category; giving it a nicer than average 1080p screen with a mundane brightness output. I think the 14\" you are looking at is in a similar category.",
  "Would this be a good/long lasting laptop for university? Hi, I’m very new to the laptop world I’ve never owned one and I was wondering whether or not this laptop would last me at least 5-6 years. I don’t game at all I just need something to do research, write papers and practice test taking on, I’m primarily looking for something that has a good battery, will last me ~1 day, a decent screen nothing too fancy and nothing that’s gonna be annoyingly slow or get annoyingly slow over time. Please let me know whether or not this is a good laptop thank you! ",
  "Thinkpad would be better.",
  "8 gb ram on Windows is quite questionable",
  "For your use case, it should be fine. Not sure about battery life, though. And you'll probably need to buy some external storage, because you'll fill that 256GB *very* quickly.",
  "The SSD is upgradeable, but it is a 2242 instead of the more common 2280, and the RAM isn't. You may hit a wall with just 8 Gigabytes of RAM. Honestly, you are better off getting a refurbished business laptop. They are generally better-built and repairable. I assume that you're in Canada based on the ad.  For a little more at a local refurb shop, you can get a P14S with more RAM and diskspace and it's repairable & upgradeable.

  "Get a refurbished Thinkpad, better build quality for the same money",
  "If you're expecting to use a bit of Canva or something graphically intensive it's not the good  laptop",
  "8gb of memory is really 2017. Those days are over.  \nIf you can get this with 16gb and you treat it with CARE (it's cheap, so the build quality will be an issue).  \nIf you will only use it for studying you'll be fine, but 256gb is not a lot if you want to put movies and music, games, videos on it.\n\nI also would always fully format and reinstall cheap laptops. In order to keep them cheap they pump them full of software you don't want that makes them REALLY slow.\n\nIf you want a great laptop for the money, go for a 3, 4 year old ex-business laptop. Usually you'll buy a 1500 dollar laptop for 400 dollars that way.",
  "I have this exact laptop. I like it realy ( i study fysiotherapie)",
  "Lenovo has recently been popular for dying motherboards in the long run some happen in 2 years.

  "Get a MacBook, best money can buy.",
  "I purchased a similar model earlier this year and would not suggest a model with soldered ram that's not expandable/replaceable. You'll find that this machine will be annoyingly slow. I have a few chrome tabs up and they eat up a little over 3GB alone.  You can find something way better for the same price at Best Buy.",
  "If you find anyone with 16gb ram and more storage (at least 512gb) it would be much better, anyways that one isn't bad either, all depends on your budget",
  "Slim 3 and long-lasting in one sentence?? No chance",
  "I would get a IdeaPad or any Lenovo laptop that is either made from actually strong plastic or metal… Or get a used ThinkPad for less",
  "I would not recommend…8gb ram is low, but 256 SSD will get used up fast for any school work. I recommend at least 16/512. \n\nAt $500 you have options…look at places like Costco or wait for Black Friday. I bought my IdeaPad 5 with 16gb/1tb SSD for $600 including tax and shipping this time last year. Even though the one shown is “on sale”, it’s still probably $200 more than I’d pay for it.",

  "Thank you!! But I’m a little worried on getting something refurbished just for it to have hidden issues that I’ll discover too late and I’ll have wasted my money",
  "How so? Like what specifications should I look for instead?",
  "First of all thank you so much for this in depth response! Also what do you mean by fully format and reinstall? I considered getting a used one but to be honest I’m extremely concerned with issues that may come with that and lack of warranty and potential hidden issues that wouldn’t show until it’s too late",
  "Really?? How long have you had it and how is the battery life and is the computer slow to process things or not?",
  "Ohh I didn’t know! I assumed since so many people around me bought Lenovos that they were better than hp and asus, also I know this may sound stupid, but does the motherboard die due to lack of care or is it like a wear and tear thing I can’t prevent?",

  "At least look for something with 16GB",
  "If you want to erase a hard disk so there's nothing left, you have to format it. It'll actually not erase anything but it'll make the computer think there's nothing in that location. and when it needs space it'll just overwrite it. To you the disk will seem empty.  \nYou will then need to reinstall windows by making a usb stick from the microsoft website (it's free), starting the computer from that stick and then putting windows on it from scratch.  \nIt's not something I recommend you do if you have no experience, but it's usually not that expensive to have it done. Or maybe you have friends who want to do it.   \nI'd do it for you for free but I see the price is in dollars, so you're nowhere near me (Netherlands :D).",

  "ASUS ROG Zephyrus Gaming vs Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 So I need to get a laptop and I’m between these two:\n\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 Gaming Laptop – Ryzen 7 4800HS 2.9GHz 16GB RAM 512GB SSD 4GB FHD NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti (No Webcam)  $1,218\n\nLenovo Yoga Slim 7 Laptop – Ryzen 7 4700U 2GHz 16GB RAM 512GB SSD AMD Shared Graphics FHD (Webcam) $1,092\n\nI know they’re different as one is gaming and the other is a normal laptop, however I was wondering whether their performance varied that much differently. I don’t need it for gaming but I might need to use data analysis softwares like SPSS and programming with R and Python. I could also be processing large datasets (rarely). \n\nI also need very minor video editing (just cropping unneeded frames from videos and rendering the final video). Also, the videos I would edit are 720p and max 1080p. \n\nI do need a webcam because I have meetings that require a webcam so if I got the Asus, I would have to buy an external webcam. \n\nMy worries are cooling and the laptops overheating because I heard ASUS laptops overheat. \n\nAny comments or suggestions based on these? Any reviews if you use either laptop would be most welcome. \n\nThanks!",
  "I would choose the ROG. because of the GPU. and laptop webcams sucks so you're better off buying a external one anyways.. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhy not try other laptops like acer nitro, legion, tuf. they're cheaper than the rog and has the same specs..",
  "So the GPU makes a lot of difference? Keep in mind I don’t game at all and I’m not sure if a dedicated GPU would make programming and light video editing easier. But at the end of the day their specs are similar except for that so I just wanted a feel of their general performance, cooling and durability as well. \nI heard the ROG was better than the TUF in terms of a lot, so that’s why I picked it. The other laptops you mentioned I’d have availability issues with. Tbh I picked a local supplier to make later interactions with them easier so these are the best they have in terms of my requirements for now. I also don’t mind paying more if the product would last longer. I’m not a fan of changing my laptop very often. \nDo you have any other laptop recommendations?",
  "yes it makes a lot of difference. having a gpu is better than only having an integrated one. in video editing, gpu can lessen the load of your cpu that means it will generate less heat, and it can render your videos faster. If you're worrying on cooling, overheating there is a fix for that, all you have to do is undervolt your laptop. I believe there's a way to undervolt ryzen cpus now.   \n\n\nIm using Predator Triton 300 right now. i5 9th gen with gtx 1650. it works great, and the frame of the laptop is steel not plastic so its faster to pull away the heat from the cpu and the gpu. my only regret was buying this laptop too early because they released a ryzen version of it :(\n\n&#x200B;\n\non the other hand, the downside of owning a gaming laptop is your battery life. on max it can only last up to 3 hours..  \n\n\nHaving a notebook laptop like the lenovo yoga is cool if you want long battery life but for me thats really it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have the budget and you dont care about the battery life, choose the rog :D",
  "Hmm, yeah that makes sense. I also just saw that they provided the ASUS ROG Strix G15 (Ryzen 7 3.2GHz 5800H 16GB 1TB 6GB 15.6inch) its significantly more expensive at $1,842 but its newer and the processor is better. It’s more SSD and graphics as well and it’s comparatively bigger. Any thoughts on this laptop? I will say, it is tempting but it’s priced pretty high and I’ve only just started my research on it. Do you think it’s worth it?",
  "Actually, no. The difference on the cpu is not that high, they're both 8 cores and the only difference they have is the base clock. You're not gonna overclock it so the G14 is definitely good for you. As you said, you don't game and you're just gonna use it for programming and video editing, you don't need a higher gpu. gtx 1650 ti can serve you a long time. \n\nYou can just upgrade the SSD of the G14 to 1TB or more and even buy a decent webcam that you need \n\noh! and if you buy the G14 you can even buy yourself a monitor.. that would even  decrease the temps of your laptop",

  "My review of Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro 5900HX, provides surprisingly good CPU performance for its slim factor. **Info:**\n&nbsp; \nThe performance is incredible for its thin form factor; read further to understand why.\nThis laptop was bought from a nordic retailer called Elgiganten\n\n\n[Retail store](https://www.elgiganten.se/product/datorer-tillbehor/barbar-dator/windows-laptops/266806/lenovo-yoga-slim-7-pro-14-barbar-dator-r9h161tb)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nHere's a pic of the laptop: \n[Pic here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/583295616470220811/856933484484362300/IMG_20210622_182621.jpg)\n \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\nThe price is pretty hefty, but this was the one with 8 cores in stock, so I went with this after waiting almost 1 year since the announcement of AMD Lenovo Yoga slim 7 Pro 2020 August.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI will be using laptops performance mode called extreme capacity and a third party software called AMD APU Tuning Utility (that allows the cpu to consume higher power in longer run) AATU for short which will be used as comparison reference to see if there's performance difference with and without AATU during benchmark.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/JamesCJ/amd-apu-tuning-utility\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinnebench 20: Extreme capacity mode:**\n\nMulti Score: 4520\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 64 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 45 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/DvmFls1.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinnebench 20: AATU:**\n\nMulti Score: 4891\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 72 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 60 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/Dw1aXon.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinebench 23: Extreme capacity mode:**\n\nSingle score: 1470\n\nMulti score: 11442\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 65 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 44 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/1GeKm4H.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinebench 23: AATU:**\n\nSingle score: 1478\n\nMulti score: 12547\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 73 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 60 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/UFIqDe8.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Geekbench 5:**\n\nhttps://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/8527380\n\nEDIT: redid the geekbench putting the laptop under ideal condition this time\n\nhttps://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/8539588\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n**Aida64 Memory Benchmark:**\n\n[Benchmark](https://i.imgur.com/ZDONu1F.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**LatencyMon:**\n\n[Result](https://i.imgur.com/qXYhvga.png)\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Keyboard and trackpad:**\n\nThe key travel is a bit short to my liking, but I get used to it eventually. Lenovo comes with FNlock in escape key, which makes it easier to disable and enable. This is still a better keyboard to type than M1 macbook, though.\n\nTrackpad is a glass surface; while it's not that good compare to macbooks, it is still pretty damn close. Very smooth and enjoyable surface to touch. \nThe trackpad has a quiet click and doesn't rattle at all. The trackpad is firm in its stationary position.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Battery:**\n\n6 hours, with 60hz enabled and using multiple battery optimization. The screen itself chugs a lot of watt due to the resolution. Considering I'm primarily at the library with power plugged in, I don't find the low battery performance an issue. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nLenovo has built an excellent cooling solution wherewith restrictions temporarily removed, and it can sustain 60 watts in such a slim form factor that provides fantastic performance. Gaming laptops with 5900hx scored 4912, while my laptop with AATU reached 4872, which is incredibly impressive considering how thin the laptop is. \nSee hardware unboxed score of 5900hx [HERE](https://youtu.be/pdO4u87UCYI?t=229)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe build quality is up there with m1, and has a premium quality feel to it. The chassis doesn't budge when twisting the base. The screen hardly wobbles, although you kind of struggle to open the lid with 1 finger. The structure rigidity in this laptop case is excellent.\nCuriously, Lenovo decided to throttle performance, capping the max temp at around 85-89 degrees celsius. Doing this prevents the cpu from consuming more watts, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. \n\nAATU bypasses Lenovo throttle restriction and allows the cpu to get a bit more hotter while still staying within acceptable temperature according to AMD. This removal allowed us to consume higher power consumption which brings us better performance. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe fans are also pretty good at idle, where its very quiet and also very good when it ramps up to faster rpm speed. It's very subtle when the fans adjust the RPM speed. \nThe laptop fans stay very quiet even when watching twitch streams in 1080p streams, which is fantastic.\n\nThis laptop came with a lenovos premium warranty service where they offer live support and send technicians to your home to fix the laptop. I've waited close to 1 year for this laptop ever since lenovo announced the 4800H version of this laptop, and I'm delighted with this laptop.",
  "Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 7 GTX reviews? I notice that the IdeaPad Slim 7 GTX (with 15.6\" FHD display, 16 GB RAM, discrete GTX 1650 graphics) has recently become [available](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-gaming-laptops/IdeaPad-Slim-7-15IMH05/p/88IPS701407) for purchase in the US on Lenovo's website. However, I can't seem to find any reviews online yet, so I'm wondering if anyone has experience with this laptop or similar models available internationally (i.e., Yoga Slim 7 etc.)? I'm particularly interested in the configuration with the 6-core i7-10750H - specifically re thermals and noise.",

  "Might be worth checking out r/laptopdeals",
  "Get something used. Definitely don't need to spend 800 if you don't want to either. XPS 15 or dell precision equivalent of the XPS is my recommendation. You are getting a way higher end machine than what you can get for $800 new. \n\nI bought a 10th intel gen one with 32GB ram and 1TB SSD for $400 and then I spent another $100 for a brand new battery from dell. I like that dell actually sells parts, it's especially important for laptop batteries because all the ones I've gotten on eBay in the past have been low quality.",

  "Honestly, I think it could handle everything, maybe not at MAX settings, but at good ones and also reviews don't always mean anything, just because something doesn't have a ton of reviews doesn't mean it sucks,just means not that many like to write reviews or that many people haven't found this laptop yet and people also buy such laptops on other sites as well.",
  "considering laptops often get like 20 reviews, its fine",
  "Gotcha.",
  "OK thank you. Have a good day.",
  "Is this laptop good? I’m only gonna use it to watch shows, play Roblox, and school work ",
  "as for specs it's not the best but it'll do. what concerns me is the processor and the storage. celerons are not very good and 128gb is too small.\ni'd recommend strengthening those two areas",
  "Not at all. 1. No Celerons. 2. 16GB RAM Minimum for Windows 11. 3. 256GB or preferably 512GB Storage.",
  "I wouldn’t call it “good” but it should be able to handle Roblox and basic daily tasks.",
  "It's pretty much shit honestly. Save up and get something better. Sorry.",
  "The worst thing about this garbage is that they sell it at a high price. \nThat thing should cost at most 200 usd\nThey are useless, I have one but on HP and it is crap",
  "Its an ideapad. It will be almost dead in 3 years and UFS is what they use in the shitty phones",
  "Funny seeing this on here. Bought this for nursing school, broken 3 or 4 months later. I now have a used HP that was much cheaper, much older, and performs way better.",
  "Fwe years ago i got ideapad gaming 3 for 300 euros is not that good either but it can do ewrything i want i advise you to buy somthing else you have plenty of options",
  "Yes, i've been using that CPU for almost two years for backend development, it's just not good, but for watching videos? Perfect one since it uses almost-nothing power",
  "No",
  "I’m not really looking for something great\n/good tbh, I’m only gonna use it for what i said in the title",
  "Well it’s on sale for 200 at Best Buy right now",
  "Well I’m not gonna play any high graphic games, I’m only gonna play Roblox which is not graphically demanding",
  "This is like a $120 laptop",
  "Yes but better specs you have you will have better windows experience and baisic tasks will be faster windows is nowdays demanding",
  "Do you have any recommendations on laptops?",
  "Expandable RAM vs premium feel Hello, I want to buy a laptop for university, and I’m between two models:\n\n- ASUS expertbook p1\n- Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5\n\nLenovo has aluminum body, better screen and that premium feel.\nASUS has good build quality, and expandable RAM + SSD.\n\nI don’t know which one should I choose, both of them are similar and seem good spec wise, and I haven’t seen many bad reviews for either. Love the looks and specs of the Lenovo but I also think that expandable ram would be ideal. \n\nExtra info: \nLenovo: Ryzen 7 7735HS, IPS sRGB 100%, 13,3”, 16gb lpddr5x-6400mts, 512gb ssd PCIe\n\nASUS: i5 13420H, IPS NTSC 45%, 14”, 16 GB DDR5-SDRAM (2x SO-DIMM, 64 max), 512 SSD PCIe 4.0",
  "Lenovo RAM is not upgradable.",
  "It depends what your usage is. 16GB is great for everyday usage with some to spare.\n\n\nWith both laptops I doubt there will be a use case where you will need a laptop with more than 16GB ram but I'll let you judge that as you'll know your usage and if it's going to change over time.\n\n\nIf you feel your usage might change and you'll do more intensive tasks than the one with upgradable ram might be the better option.",
  "Get the MBA. Thank me after your graduation.",
  "I know! That’s why I don’t know if I should get the asus for the expandable ram or the Lenovo for everything else",
  "Thank you I think Im getting the Lenovo, appreciate the advice!",
  "Can you give any reason why MBA?",
  "I would love to but it’s out of my budget unfortunately, you can’t get it for $800 in Spain",

  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

  "Am I about to make a mistake? Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i \nhttps://www.lenovo.com/au/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-pro-series/lenovo-yoga-pro-7i-gen-10-aura-edition-14-inch-intel/83kfcto1wwau2\n\nI am thinking if buying this. Cannot for the life of me find a single review directly of this model. Or a related one with different specs. It's all Slims and 2-in-1s. \n\n\nWHY AM I LOOKING AT IT?\nNot for gaming, other than maybe a light cozy thing here or there. It's so I can do office type and browsing functions while I am on the move and potentially some light music production. \n\n\nThin and light would be good. Want to be able to carry it around without hassle. \n\n\nNeed a good battery life but not insane. 8 hours would be fine. Sales tech said this would get at least 10. I'd reduce the refresh rate to 60hz, I won't need 120 most of the time. Presumably that'll eek more time out. \n\n\nBest I can tell CPU should be pretty future proofed. Seems basically as good as it gets for this category. \n\n\nRAM is confirmed by sales tech as dual channel. Unfortunately there doesn't seem an option to do 64gb instead which would give me future proofing comfort. \n\nBut as far as I can tell the RAM (LPDDR5X-8533MT/s) is basically top of the line for portable laptops. \n\n\nWHAT AM I WORRIED ABOUT?\nMain thing keeping me from pulling the trigger is glossy screen as I like bright rooms and sitting outside haha but... seems like nearly all of then have that. I assume I can maybe put a screen film over it of some kind? \n\n\nSecond thing is overheat potential. Without reviews on this specific configuration, seems a risk the ultra 9 285H might get SPICY. I presume I can maybe manage this by reducing power in the settings...",
  "Idk about this model specifically as I'm researching a 2in1 to purchase, why are all the Lenovo 2 in 1's so much more expensive than their pro counterparts?? My local retailers won't even stock them as their price is just absurd.\n\nAlso, because these brands make multiple laptops of the same format with different specs, usually have to look at them as a whole, then the changed specs individually. Look for reviews on the yoga/yoga pro (compared to other brands, some great reviews and minimal complaints), then make sure the cpu is good.",
  "Hmmm. Interesting. What region are you in? I'm in Victoria Australia and here it seems like the 2 in 1s are pretty affordable, they just use the less heavy duty specs (Vs instead of Hs). \n\n\nBut yeh that's kind of what I've had to make do with RE reviews. Kind of gettins the vibe of similar names and judhing it off that. My exact thoughts on it. The complexity of the seemingly similar but not quite same laptop models with different nearly the same name and completely different specs has made the review space completely fucked to navigate hahaha.",
  "Im in QLD, I should have clarified for the same specs, the 2in1's are more expensive. Currently I'm trying to find specs for a version JB hifi sell but Lenovo have removed completely from their website. Of course they do that and JB don't specify.",
  "To be fair JBs laptop prices are uniformly atrocious hahaha. They charge amounts for specs that are several tiers below what that price point should provide. I think their target market is mostly people who know nothing about computers haha",
  "That's true, but jb for at least one of the models is the exact same price as Lenovo website, without the 3-5 week wait.",
  "Yeh they sometimes might be ok generally, but i notice A lot of the lenovo website prices themselves are inflated. \nLike the one I posted is apparently 40% off, as are other ones im considering which are slightly less speccy, full price of 3.2k or so. But the literal same laptop at a retailer like HN or Office Works is like 2.3k full price. \nSo lenovo website on sale is a genuine sale price but not on sale they're wildly expensive."
