  "Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11 - But which configuration Hi all! I will start to work as a bioinformatician and therefore I'm in the need of a new notebook. I think the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11 is the perfect match for me, due to many positive reviews, its longevity, the keyboard, and its light weight. Of course, it's also a high-end business laptop. \n\nHowever, I'm a little bit overwhelmed by the amount of different configurations I can choose from. It should be powerful enough for my work, but I don't want to overkill on some parts.  For now I'm thinking about getting it with 32GB RAM (due to large datasets + ML + future proofing) and a 256 GB SSD (Will upgrade it in the future and save some money now). However, I have no clue which CPU I should get. I can choose between i7-1355U, i5-1335U, i5-1345U, i7-1365U and the i7-1370P. \n\nFrom what I've heard is the U version a low power version, that will be better for battery life and heat. But I don't know if it will too weak. Can anybody help me out? :) I would be grateful for any kind of advice!  \n\nBest ",

  "Help deciding between these Lenovo ThinkPad and Dell Inspiron laptops - any insight appreciated I need to make a decision on a new laptop and could use help deciding. I'm down to the ones listed in the below table (though if you think I should consider a different one let me know). I don't use this for anything particularly intensive or specific (e.g., no gaming, programming, CAD, etc), this is just an all-around laptop. I would say my main criteria is reliability/build quality - I tend to keep laptops a long time (e.g. 8-10 years) so I want this to last a long time. That said, I would appreciate a nice screen (I do use it for some photo/video editing) and would like decent battery life (though it spends most of its time plugged in).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/709cqhhecbke1.jpg?width=1110&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee5190ab219f2ce43705c9a4dff1d2b935e69fc9\n\nHere is my current thinking on these - I would appreciate anyone's input/thoughts, personal experience, etc.\n\n* **Lenovo vs. Dell** \\- I like Lenovo a lot, I have one for my work computer and I love the keyboard. I'm leaning that way, but per the below I am trying to figure out why I wouldn't get the Dell...\n* **Yoga 9i** \\- I love this and this was going to be my choice (particularly love the design and screen), but I'm concerned about (i) only 16 GB of RAM (I could bump it up but that's $500-600 more) and (ii) lots of reviews say the real-world battery life is very poor.\n* **X1 Carbon Gen 11** \\- I know this is a prior gen but the new one is too expensive. Main concern with this one is the lower resolution screen (obviously has an older processor, but again shouldn't make a huge difference in what I use it for).\n* **ThinkPad T14** \\- This is obviously more expensive and has the same drawback of lower quality screen, but it's on the list because (i) it seems to be basically a tank that would last a long time (and could be easily repaired if need be) and (ii) it comes with a 3-year warranty.\n* **Dell Inspiron** \\- The background here is I went to Micro Center to try out the Lenovos and saw the stats on this one and I'm basically trying to figure out what the catch is with this. It generally has the same or better specs than all the others for quite a bit cheaper. What is the catch or drawback with this one? My one concern (other than the fact that I must be missing something) is that it has a lower brightness of 300 nits (which I feel could be an annoyance when using it in a bright room for example).\n\nI hope to buy this in the next day or so, so thanks for all the help!",

  "Help me choose: Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 13 or HP Elitebook X G1a Hi folks, can you please share your thoughts on this choice?

And I really appreciate it works good after 8 years, I don't like to refresh often. But yeah it gets outdated, I feel the lack of cpu power etc.  \n\\- I like the power specs of AMD 375 in HP. I have big servers for really long calculations, but still a lot of computation, programming, photoediting, all these require cpu power.   \n\\- I like light weight of Lenovo, and I like my current Lenovo, but Intel 258V is so frustratingly slower than AMD 375. It may play no role now, particularly considering I have servers for computations. Still in 4 or 5 years it may make a lot of difference...\n\nThanks for reading all this, and particularly if you can add some value to this choice!",

  "Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 12 fan noise issue I have recently bought a Lenovo Carbon X1 Gen 12 based on Ultra 7 165U (21KC000MUS) with Win 11 Pro. To my surprise, the fan noise level is very disappointing, especially when connected through a dock (34\" Xiaomi monitor and Thinkpad 40AS dock). The noise level is very disturbing even with basic tasks such as web browsing (without any videos). Sometimes the standard fan noise is accompanied with a high pitched noise which wasn't the case with my previous X1C Gen 8.\n\nApparently I haven't done my research properly before buying. I incorrectly assumed that since these CPUs are more energy efficient than the ones that were used in X1C Gen 8, the noise level will also be at least not worse than in Gen 8.\n\nAfter reading Reddit posts and asking Perplexity, I tried the following fixes to lower the noise:\n\n1. Installed the latest Windows updates and drivers (via Lenovo Vantage)\n2. Updated BIOS to the latest version (N3YET74W 1.39)\n3. Changed the power profile to Balanced both in BIOS and in Windows\n4. Turned on the battery saver mode even when docked\n5. Set the maximum processor state to 99% for both \"on battery\" and \"plugged in\" modes.\n\nAs I type this with only a few Chrome windows open, the CPU temperature fluctuates around 60-70C and the fan is noisy.\n\nI'm also planning to try a cooling pad, but I doubt that it will make a difference. I'm afraid I will have to sell the device on the secondary market and go for another model / brand.\n\nMaybe I'm missing some additional tweaks/fixes that could improve the fan noise?",

However, the battery degraded from \"Original design capacity: 52.06 Wh\" to \"Full charge capacity: 37.36 Wh,\" which is normal for an old laptop, I guess. Still works fine, but it gets dodgy if I need to take it out. I have about 1-2 hours of battery life doing my usual work.\n\n  \nMy usual work involves a lot of writing in Word and screenwriting programs, as well as reading. I don't play games on the laptop (obviously), but I enjoy a YouTube video here and there.\n\nI'd like to get the new X1 Gen 13, and was dreaming about an OLED screen. I don't care about upgradeability. However, while researching (for the past 2 weeks), it seems that OLED is not the best for my needs because of PWM. On the other hand, I found that people tend to exaggerate.\n\nThose of you who have Gen 13 and do similar work to mine, do you notice any problems (such as PWM) with day-to-day work on that particular OLED screen that is in Gen 13?\n\nFor more information, I watch movies on LG C4, which is, of course, OLED. I usually watch movies with English subtitles in the evening so my brightness is set between 0 and 10 pixel brightness (as I understand, PWM happens at lower brightness) - and I don't notice any eye strain. Although I suppose that my intended use for Gen 13 (reading, writing) is different than watching movies from a distance.\n\nOne more thing: if OLED is not good for the things that people usually do on Thinkpads, how come they decided to put OLED screens in those machines made for office work?",

  "CES 2025 Lenovo Laptops. Thoughts? Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition vs X1 Carbon Gen 13 vs X9 Aura Edition CES 2025 Laptops just got released for preorder. I think these 3 options looks and feel great but I do not know which one to choose. Would love to hear any opinions from anybody.\n\nI am mainly using the laptop for simple tasks such as checking emails, editing documents, using Office, general web browsing and media consumption. I travel a lot so the X1 Carbon's weight is a plus but not sure whether the battery life is good and I am lowkey worried about having fingerprint stains all the time on my laptop as I had a bad experience with the XPS 13 2in1. \n\nThe X9 and Yoga 9i 2-in-1 looks like they will not be attracting so much stains but I wonder if the extra weight will be noticeable.\n\nWould love to hear u guys chime on this! I would be most likely pulling the trigger by the start of February!",
  "More consumer slop that has minimal improvements over last year's models.",
  "My wife is getting a new Yoga 9i Aura Edition, I'm curious to see how it works out...  Looking at the new 2-in-1's hitting the market, it seems to be the best option.  It got the top nods from people at CES.  Followed closely by the updated ASUS.  She's an educator and the school district is supplying it.  She got to order whatever laptop she wanted through their IT portal, which basically lets her pick anything from Apple, Lenovo or Dell.  She's been predominantly Apple based for several years, lives on her iPad Pro, but changed schools this past fall.  Apple does not play nice in her new environment that is a mis-mash of Windows and Chrome, so she asked for the new computer.  Went 2-in-1 so she could keep with her notes and annotations workflow and PDF authoring as she's been doing.  \n\nAnyway, should have it by the end of the month, config:  Ultra 7 258V w/ 32GB RAM, Windows 11 Pro, 512GB SSD, 2.8K 120Hz OLED.\n\nFrom my perspective...  I agree with the other poster here that it looks like more consumer slop.  The Ultra 7 2xx CPUs (Lunar Lake) seem to be an improvement over the 1xx series, but still lagging behind others.  Lenovo seems to at least be using a decent screen and apparently the speakers are not complete trash.  Still chunkier than it needs to be, mostly to keep using those Intel CPUs and chipsets.  Battery life on the current 9i looks to be underwhelming and I don't expect an improvement on this slightly upgraded version with the 200 series CPU.   2-in-1 laptops are always a handful of compromises, but I think my wife's use case is what they're made for.",
  "Yea I think the 9i 2-in-1 would work well for your wife since she does annotating a lot. I like the current 9i due to its curved edges and design and i think the Lunar Lake chips would improve the battery life enough to give a decent full day usage or if not close to it.\n\nRight now how I would look at the 3 options I have would be:  \nYoga 9i 2-in-1: Bigger Battery and 2-in-1 is nice for its versatility   \nThinkpad X9 14: A Windows Mac that does not attract fingerprint stains like the X1   \nX1 Carbon G13: Really light and great for travel but fingerprint/stain magnet\n\nI was leaning to the X1 Carbon G13 before CES 2025 released the new models and X9 seems like a good in-between option due to its metal design. I do know its getting a lot of hate for it not having the trackpoint but I don't see myself needing it anyway as I never owned a Thinkpad before.\n\nIf the X1C isn't so prone to stains and all like what people claim it to be, I would definitely get the X1 Carbon for its weight. Otherwise, the X9 is a good workaround for me and 9i would just be for its bigger battery.",
  "Hi can you tell as how is the battery life?",
  "lunar lake literally is best in class. not else touches it on windows.",
  "Battery life seems reasonable for an intel chip.  My wife is getting a full day out of it pretty easy but she’s not pushing it too hard.  Mostly email, Office apps, Google Docs and such.  Notes / annotations.  The pen is OK, not as good as the Apple Pencil or the Wacom based ones on the Surface.  I couldn’t tell you more specifically than that.",
  "Can HP Elitebook Ultra G1i 14” be considered a worthy competitor to Thinkpad x9 14\" or Carbon X1 Gen 13, or are HP laptops still not in the same league? Hey everyone,\n\nI'm looking to upgrade my current Thinkpad Carbon X1 Gen 5 and wanted to get your thoughts on whether [HP Elitebook Ultra G1i 14](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-elitebook-ultra-g1i-14-inch-notebook-next-gen-ai-pc-wolf-pro-security-edition-p-b69ytua-aba-1#techSpecs)” could be a solid alternative to Thinkpad x9 14\" or Carbon X1 Gen 13, or are HP laptops still not up to par?\n\n**Build quality** is very important to me, beyond just basic reliability. Also, the **keyboard**, **touchpad**, and **screen** need to be \"very good+\" to \"excellent\". I understand that the keyboard of any HP laptop won't be at the level of a Thinkpad keyboard, but it still needs to be really good (definitely better than Macbook keyboards).\n\nIt is worth noting that my last experience with HP's laptops was about 15 years ago, and it was honestly terrible..\n\nI'm not looking to dive into performance comparisons or nitpick small details right now. I just want to understand if HP have genuinely improved over the past 15 years to the point where the Elitebook series (and particularly the HP Elitebook Ultra G1i 14” laptop) is truly at the level of the Thinkpad series (and specifically the Thinkpad x9 14\" or the Carbon X1 Gen 13).\n\nI'll note that I saw one review of HP Elitebook Ultra G1i on [Notebookcheck.net](https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-EliteBook-Ultra-G1i-14-laptop-review-HP-s-new-business-flagship-is-a-great-total-package.984955.0.html), which was overall quite good, and another review here on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1izv3v7/hp_elitebook_ultra_g1i_full_review), which was somewhat lukewarm, but not negative in a way that would rule out this laptop.\n\np.s. the machine will be running Linux.\n\nWould love to hear your opinions and recommendations :)\n\nThanks in advance.",

  "Dell 7450 2 in 1 or Thinkpad X1 Carbon G12 for Business Hi there. I am being offered a choice of a Dell 7450 2 in 1 or Thinkpad X1 Carbon G12 for my work. I am a consultant. I spent most of my day on Teams and in Excel, Powerpoint and Word. I work from home and am docked most of the time, but  also travel about once a month, \n\n  \nAny suggestions would be appreciated.

Both are around 450-500USD. What should I choose? Thanks!",
  "I would say it really depends on your use case. I would go for the mac if you want to do video editing or music/ design work, for the better display (probably). \nIf you want CPU performance, I would go for the ThinkPad, as it will have better cooling. I believe the ThinkPad also has a newer processor, by one generation. Geneally the ThinkPad will be more repairable and replacement parts will be cheape. It also has more ports. \n\n\nIf you have an iPhone, the mac will integrate nicely, less so the ThinkPad as things like handoff, air drop and messages on the lapop won't work nearly as flawless.",
  "ThinkPad P14s Gen 4 VS ZBook Firefly 14 Gen 11 Hey guys, can you please help me choose the best model? \n\nI'm a software engineer who heavily uses Visual Studio and Docker.",
  "both are great but Thinkpads are known for their great performance, build quality and overall life. Plus lenovo has a better customer service reputation than Asus so i will say go for Thinkpad.",
  "I actually have a P14s Gen 4 AMD and a Zbook Firefly 14 G10A.\n\nComparing them, the Zbook is smaller and lighter.  It's 2 SODIMM's so can have the ram upgraded, while the P14s G4A is fully soldered.  If you're looking at G4 Intel, then if it's iGP only it has up to 16GB is soldered and there is a single SODIMM available for expansion.  If it's the dGPU version, then all the ram is soldered.  If you're doing memory hungry tasks this can make a difference, the Intel P14S will max at 48GB (iGP) or 64GB (dGPU) while the Firefly can go 96GB.\n\nI also like the displays available on the Firelfly 14 better.  Both have several WUXGA options, the P14s has a 2.2K that's a great display (ideal resolution for 14\" IMO) but isn't very bright, and the 2.8K OLED that I hated utterly (ugly text and absolutely HORRIBLE battery life).  The Firefly after the WUXGA's has the option of the 2.5K/WQXGA 500-nit screen.  Better IMO in every way to the 2.8K OLED.  Can use it at native resolution without scaling for 14\" (not as pleasant as the 2.2K, but still just barely usable), brighter, text if scaled fractionally doesn't look horrible.",
  "Thanks!",
  "Firefly is HP, but nice try",
  "Thank you very much!",

  "Lenovo x1 carbon gen. 5 not booting. Hello.\n\nI have an issue with my lenovo x1 carbon gen. 5. As described in the headline, the pc isn't booting.\n\nI've tried everything from holding down the power button to disconnecting the c-mos battery, including disconnecting the main battery and try booting it with only the charger plugged in. I've tried with another outlet and another power brick. Nothing have worked.\n\nI'm a little bit techy, so i've disassembled the laptop and disconnected all external components that could lead to a short in the mb. That didn't work either. The only thing the laptop does is blink 3 times, when the charger is plugged in.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1ilhjjz/video/tqxargd6x4ie1/player\n\nThe CPU is getting hot as pointed to in the video.

  "Ouhh Lenovo tech here, specialize in industry grade machine like X1. Definitely a bad mobo, replacing it is doable, getting it is the challenge. They don't usually sell them like that unless you call them and they do diagnostic, support, dispatch, pricing...... As for bit locker, try logging into m360 if you've to find the code. They usually are activated if you've synced with it"
