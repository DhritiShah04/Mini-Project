  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

  "Will the ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2025) Handle My Workload ArcGIS Pro + AutoCAD & Tons of Multitasking? I am looking for a laptop to use as a workstation in case I need to provide my own equipment in the future. I am a Design Engineer working with Aerial & Underground fiber optics in the Telecom field. I mainly use ArcGIS Pro & AutoCAD for drafting & designing routes. While I have one of those programs open, I also must have MS Teams, MS Outlook, MS Excel, Adobe Acrobat, Google Earth Pro, 2 to 3 File Explorer folders, plus a web browser running Katapult + Katapult Photo + Katapult Map + Client Engineering Support Platform + Sharepoint + Smartsheet (around 6-7 tabs depending on Google Earth Pro/Google Maps) all running at the same time. I can get away with Google Maps most of the time. Long story short heavy multi tasking processing is a must.\n\nI do not know much about the difference between AMD & Intel processors but from what I have heard AMD excels at multi tasking & Intel is better at running single tasks. Please correct me if any technical information is wrong. Things have evolved a lot since I last purchased a laptop a decade ago for college.\n\nMy current position supplied me a laptop I am very happy with. Here are the specs:\n\nDell Precision 5690\n\nIntel Core Ultra 7 155H (3.80 GHz)\n\n32 GB RAM Speed 7467 MT/s\n\n1 TB SSD\n\n128 MB Intel Arc Graphics\n\n16 inch touchscreen\n\nI have had bad experiences with the Dell I used throughout high school. After having it serviced 7 or 8 times because of the cheap plastic hinge, I replaced it with an all metal Asus in 2017 when I started college. Here are those specs:\n\nASUS Q504UA\n\nIntel Core i5 7200U (2.5 GHz)\n\n12 GB RAM Speed 2133 MHz\n\n1 TB SSD\n\n128 MB Intel HD Graphics 620\n\n15.6 inch touchscreen 2 in 1\n\nEven though I had bad experiences with Dell in the past, this Precision 5690 is really nice. I like the all metal design for the shell & hinges. My only problems with it is that I have yet to see them go on sale and I hate that it only has USB C ports. The XPS goes on sale from time to time but I do not know if that will give me what I need.\n\nAfter doing research the unanimous answer from coworkers, gamer friends, the internet, & even AI was that the bare minimum I need is 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, an AMD Ryzen 7 or 9 / Intel Core Ultra 7 or 9 / Intel Core i7 or i9 processor, & a dedicated graphics card. Preferably I want something that has an extra RAM slot & an extra M.2 slot so that I can upgrade RAM & storage in the future.\n\nI pulled an all nighter last night going through all of the Best Buy Black Friday deals trying to find THE ONE. I narrowed it down to Lenovo, & Asus. I ended up with three options: Lenovo Yoga 9i Pro, Lenovo Legion Pro 5, & the ASUS ROG Strix G16. All three had 16 inch screens but the Yoga got kicked out because it does not have expandable RAM or storage. That left the Legion Pro & Strix G16. I watched a ton of review & comparison videos, checked rtings, & I think I finally did it. I chose the ASUS ROG Strix G16 based on my personal preferences, AMD over Intel processor, & the nail in the coffin was my childhood friend’s recommendation plus his father’s recommendation. They preferred Asus over Lenovo. His fathet owned a Legion Pro, the best Alienware 16 inch, & recently switched to the Strix G16 & loves it. The only difference between my choice & his is that mine has the RTX 5070 while his has the RTX 570Ti, which in my opinion is not worth the extra 800 dollars which is the current difference with the black friday sale favoring mine.\n\nHere are the specs for the winner:\n\nASUS ROG Strix G16\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9000 9955HX3D (2.5 GHz with boost up to 5.4 GHz)\n\n32 GB DDR5 RAM (5600 MHz)\n\nExtra SO DIMM slot (tool free)\n\n1 TB SSD PCIe 4.0\n\nExtra M.2 slot (PCIe Gen 5 ready)\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 with 8 GB GDDR7\n\n16 inch 2.5K 240 Hz 3 ms Nebula Display\n\nNow here are my questions for you all:\n\n1) Will this do what I need it to do?\n\n2) Do these laptops last or will it brick in a few years?\n\nI plan on babying this laptop if that helps.\n\n3) Is 20% off the best sale I am going to find for a current generation ROG Strix G16?\n\n4) Do I need an external cooling pad or fan? If not needed, would you still recommend one, & if so which one works best with this laptop?\n\nThis is going to be my personal computer that can double as a workstation if I need it. The fact that it is a gaming laptop is a plus for when I finally make the switch from console. I like the fact there are 2 x USB-A 3.2 in addition to the the 2 x UBS-C ports. I do not know if I will ever be a full PC person since I like being able to move around, laptops are my power meets portability. My job tried to give me a computer but I declined as I visit family and a tower is not a realistic option for me to travel with.\n\nI am sure this is probably way too much information & I might be making too big of a deal out of this. This thing will probably do everything I need & more. I just like doing my homework before sinking a grand or more into something. Buying a new car took years & the only reason I finally did it was because squirrels totaled my old one.\n\nThanks for your help guys and gals I really appreciate it!",
  "Honestly, think about if you actually NEED a laptop. With this budget you can build a WAY faster desktop.\n\nPersonally, I'd build an equivalent desktop which would save some cash, sell my current laptop and use that money to buy like a 4050 laptop.\n\nYou'd have a capable workstation at home, and a machine to get you by during the day.\n\nThat's of course if you don't NEED portability at all times. \n\nIf you do, this should be fine. I know a engineer who uses a RTX 2060 laptop for work to this day. And my dad's company (which is for construction), had some similarly powerful workstations a few years ago.\n\n\n\nTldr; This is fine, but if possible get a desktop + a reasonable laptop, for your use-case.",
  "I would say get intel, it had a lot more cores then amd, but in all fairness the laptop should be enough for all of your tasks, 32gb might not be enough so consider upgrading, but i think you should get the laptop",
  "I appreciate your feedback. I actually did think about it. Right now I'm doing well in my position, just was getting worried about the future. I have that ASUS that still works, & a back up Lenovo that was a hand me down to replace the eye sore that was my old Dell. The 2 in 1 ASUS got me through college using AutoCAD, Inventor, ArcGIS, & Solidworks. I don't think I need a new laptop (or desktop), I may have just been giddy at the prospect of getting a deal. I am a sucker for deals & have been known to be impulsive not to miss out on them. The deal is good for 1 more day so I'm going to sleep on it again tonight, but more than likely I may not move forward on it right now. As long as things are going well with work I don't need a personal work station. If I do need it in the future I will have done all this research & it will be an easier ordeal not having to start from scratch. \n\nThank you for your candor!\n\nEdit: I slept on it. I did some more research based on the other person's comment I looked for more comparison videos between the Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 U9 275HX & AMD Ryzen 9 9000 Series 9955HX3D on the ROG Strix G16 (2025). Based on that research I've decided to move forward on my purchase but have switched from the AMD to the Intel processor since the Intel model is newer, has an improved chasis,  & has a lot of newly improved features that support more future proofing and quality of life than the older AMD model. \n\nI am not a desktop kind of guy, portability is more important to me than strictly power & perfomance. I understand PC will outperform & be lower cost when compared to laptops. Also having both isn't a realistic option for me, it would be one or the other. My personal preference or bias is laptop > desktop.",
  "I did more research after posting & it looks like you were right. JarrodsTech compared the Intel & AMD versions. The Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 U9 275HX model came out ahead of the AMD Ryzen 9 9000 Series 9955HX3D in most cases. It also has easier access to the internals with a pull tab instead of 12 plus screws just to remove the bottom panel. The Intel model supports the next generation PCIe 5 for future proofing on both SSD ports whereas the AMD only supports PCIe 5 on 1 of 2. The Intel version includes 3 USB A ports where as the AMD only has 2 USB A ports. They have the same number of USB C ports but the port speeds are faster on the Intel than on the AMD model. The Intel also has WiFi 7 compared to WiFi 6 on the AMD.\n\nThe Intel model looks better with the 360° RGB, & it runs cooler thanks to the updated vapor chamber design. It also uses liquid metal & cools both the CPU & GPU, while the AMD version only cooled the GPU. The Intel also support facial recognition whereas the AMD does not. The Intel was more energy efficient and has a 29% longer battery life when compared to the AMD.\n\nI really appreciate your comment because it pushed me to dig deeper and helped me make a better informed decision. I was close to skipping a laptop upgrade this year, but based on Jarrod’s testing & how this newer Intel model performs and looks, I have changed my mind & am going to stop by BestBuy after work today to go ahead and place my order!\n\nIn case you wanted to see the comparison video I was talking about here is the link to it. [ASUS Strix G16 (2025) Review - Intel or AMD? Don’t Choose Wrong!](https://youtu.be/Qd-SXvTEjbk?si=wKORVbO8jDhPyMsf)",
  "I just realized in the checkout that the Intel has the RTX 5060 GPU (the 5070 is available but at a +$400 price hike) vs AMD which has the RTX 5070 GPU. The sale price between these 2 is exactly the same at 1,699. I'm thinking about sticking with the Intel because of the new and improved chasis, both M.2 SSD ports being PCIe Gen 5 compatible, improved cooling, ports, wifi, battery life, energy efficiency, and RGB.",
  "Upgrade, or try to fix and/or live with it? [Legion Pro 5 16ARX8] Hey there! I bought a Legion Pro 5 16ARX8 (82WM0006US) just over two years ago. It's been great, but recently it's starting to accumulate some wear/issues and I'm wondering if 1) it's new enough that I should get it fixed and live with whatever can't be repaired, or 2) upgrade to something new?\n\nCurrent issues: \n\n- The screen got damaged when I had the laptop in a checked bag while traveling, wherein there's a faint thin line midway up the screen, which is functional for some colors but shows as a faint blue line for others. I've gotten estimates for repairs, which are always in the $400-500 range. But currently it's fine enough that I can live with it, it'd just be a nice plus to have it fixed.\n- It's been overheating badly lately, and some components haven't been working well. I cleaned out the fans to some improvement, but since the overheating issues, my keyboard sometimes stops working intermittently (usually fixed with a restart).\n- The trackpad mouse has been acting up, but it's probably because I badly reconnected the ZIF connector when cleaning out the internals, and could probably fix this.\n\n\nCurrent specs:\n\n- AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX\n- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070\n- 32GB DDR5\n- 1TB SSD\n- 2 TB SSD\n\nI've been thinking of upgrading to a newer Legion 5 Pro (maybe the new [Gen 10](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-pro-series/legion-pro-5-gen-10-16-inch-amd/83ltcto1wwus1)?) or an Asus ROG Zephyrus, either the [G16](https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/asus/rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gu605) or maybe something more compact for traveling like the [G14](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-3k-oled-120hz-gaming-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-1tb-platinum-white/6613954.p?skuId=6613954&sb_share_source=PDP).

  "ThinkBook 16 vs Swift Go for multipurpose everyday laptop? Hi, first post here after reading TONS about laptop brands, multiple reviews, lots of 'best laptop for school' posts, youtube reviews etc etc. Yes, I am a student. I wanted a good laptop that will last a good 3 to 5 years. Im mainly doing lots of word, excel, powerpoint, and have lots of tabs open at once, watching videos. Im also interested in some amateur photoshop stuff. I also will be watching a good amount of movies, and I'd like play some video games. I think if the laptop would support it, I would play newer more demanding games, like Cyberpunk and Alan Wake 2, but gaming is not the focus. If I could at least play games like Witcher 3 and maybe baldurs gate 3, and some emulators for PS2, PS3 and PS4 games I would be happy. \n\nOriginally I bought a Legion pro 7i with the 4080 and intel i9, because I wanted a laptop that could handle most anything and be relevant for years.

  "What should I get to replace my aging acer nitro 5 ? I love mine but I want to replace it because the battery is starting to degrade, I already had an issue with the SSD overheating and now the networking is starting to go. However the hinge assembly has essentially. disintegrated with the actual metal frame cracking. This means the frail display cable is probably going to get disintegrated. \n\nI have upgraded it with the 2 NVME slots and the 1 2.5 inch slot.

He has these in stock that he can get me a discount on.\n\nA  Lenovo LEGION Pro 5i 16\" Gaming Laptop  with a 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13900HX processor and a GeForce RTX 4060 GPU\n\n An MSI GE68HX Raider 16\" Gaming Laptop  with a 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13950HX processor and a GeForce RTX 4060 GPU\n\nAn MSI Katana 15.6\" Laptop with a 12th Gen Intel Core i7-12650H -and a GeForce RTX 4060 GPU \n\nA  MSI Cyborg Gaming Laptop with an 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13620H and an GeForce RTX 4050 GPU\n\nSo what would you get and why ? I want to see your reasoning and compare them with my own. \n\nAlso if you own any of these or have owned them what is your experience like ? ",
  "The ge68hx will be the fastest but I personally prefer legion as it has slightly better build",
  "I read a few reviews on Lenovo 5 Pro or 5 Slim. They seemed to be really designed regarding good build quality and an above average keyboard and screen.",
  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",
  "My mac just died I need help to choose a new laptop. It's a laptop for personal use. I will use it mainly for web browsing and gaming (no triple-a games, mostly old ones). Note that my mac was not able to run half life 1... I know nothing in this regard, but I want something reliable and tough. I'm looking for one of those 2 models. Which one would you suggest me and feel free to recommend other model as well (specs close to : intel i5 or AMD, 16gb ram, 512gb memory and a dgpu). Budget around 1-1.5k.\n\nhttps://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-pro-series/legion-pro-5-gen-8-(16-inch-amd)/82wm0000us#reviews\n\nhttps://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadp/thinkpad-p15v-gen-3-(15-inch-amd)/21em0034us\n\nThx a lot !",
  "Help me to chose  \n\n**Hello,**\n\ni am a life time windows user. But on my last notebook (*asus TUF A15*) windows 3-4 times a week shuts down for no reason. I assume thats the problem with the OS on my notebook. Im kinda tilted bcs of it.\n\nSo i am thinking of rerolling to macbook. This asus cost me about **1000€** and i would like to keep the price point also with the macbook. I was so hyped about pro version but its way out of my budget.\n\nSo thats why i am here. I would like to ask you if macbook air m1 16gb unified memory would be enough to edit full HD and 4k videos with effects (i am a video/photo editor). I saw some reviews about that. Some of them were like \"No don´t buy it, because it throttles\" on the other hand some people say that it is usable and power doesn´t go down bcs of thermal throttling that much.\n\nI am kinda torn between:\n\n**- Macbook air M1 16gb unified memory**\n\n**- Lenovo legion 5 pro, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, RAM 16GB DDR4, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 6GB 130 W** \n\nI must poke out that i play only one game which is **League of legends** nothing more. I don´t play high demand graphics games or something like that.\n\n*Thank you for your answers :-)*",
