  "Lenovo Thinkbook 16p Gen 6 (2025) Hello everyone, for those who have the Thinkbook 16p Gen 6 (2025), can you give us a brief review on perfomance, display, keyboard, constructive quality and of course.. some photos?\nThank you",
  "Hey recently I bought it from china will use it and let yall know \n\nSpecs \nUltra 9 275HX\n32Gigs of ram\nrtx 5070\n1 tb ssd",
  "I am also interested to know more about this product.",
  "Greattttt",
  "Hey so here are my thoughts on my laptop.\n\nI also do not know anything about its gaming capabilities as i have only played Forza horizon 4 on it and its an absolute breeze but I believe the 5070 will hold up\n\nSo my main use case is on Ansys mechanical and Optislang so I don’t find delays of any sort and also when using the GPU acceleration my simulations run pretty quickly as compared to my previous laptop which had a i5-1240p with no graphics card and the difference is astronomical especially all CAD tasks are smooth as butter with that said I do feel that the battery like could be improved as on a single charge it only lasts about 4.5 hours  and prolly 6 hours of light usage and also the magic bay i have not used it but i feel it is not really required.\n\nThe build quality is top notch\nThe keyboard is also good but not thinkpad p1 level \nAnd display is actually pretty good\n\nAlso there is little to no thermal throttling so far and the fans don’t even spin at light use cases\n\nAnyways my verdict is that it’s a really good laptop go for it if your budget allows you to. It costed almost  $1900",

I am looking forward to playing Rust, The Forest, GTA V, Rainbow, Six Siege, PUBG, Rocket League, and maybe Forza Horizon.\n\nOn medium-high settings. Do you think this configuration would be a good idea?",

  "Thinkbook 16p gen 4 vs legion slim 7 (Amd) I’m coming from a 2020 MacBook Pro 13 with gen 10 i5 and I’m gonna need a windows machine for university (last two years in mechanical engineering). I’ve been flawlessly using boot camp since now but I don’t think it’s gonna be able to keep up with the other programs we are gonna use.\n\nThe choice came down to these two mainly because of the design, portability and power/price ratio. I’ve also been thinking about using a desktop remotely through my Mac but I don’t need that much power nor having to leave it on every time.\n\nWith actual sales they both sell for ~1600€\n\nThe main differences and concerns between these two are the following:\n\n- bigger trackpad on the thinkbook, and I’m a big trackpad user\n\n- the battery is bigger on the legion (99 vs 80)\n\n- the thinkbook gets the i9 13900H or the i7 13700H for roughly the same price but maybe the i9 is “overkill” and drains too much power. On the other hand the ryzen 7 on the legion appears to be much more powerful efficient while on battery\n\n- I was also concerned about the number of p cores on the intel vs the amd, which instead has no e cores\n\n- apparently the silent mode on the legion allows better performances, is it because of different cooling system?\n\n- the thinkbook has ir so works with face unlock\n\n- on the thinkbook configurator it doesn’t allow me to have both 32 gb of ram and the 3,2k monitor. Fortunately both the ram are upgradable (the legion has a soldered one) so I can buy the 8+8 version and switch them in the future if I need. \n\n- the WQXGA display has better nits on the legion than the thinkbook (500 vs 400)\n\nI’d like to know if the 3,2k monitor is any better than the WQXGA (2560 x 1600) and if it’s battery killer too because is available in both.\n\nThey both have the 4060 8gb that is more than enough for what I need but should allow some gaming and 3d modeling and rendering room.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, or maybe can suggest another laptop, with similar design, I’d be really happy.",

  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",

  "i have one, i love it and find it enjoyable but im not a lappy connoisseur like you ive only had desktops for last decade, i will monitor this touchpad thing and touchscreen issue, but i use a bt mouse mostly, and i dont have this glow on the screen, or not that i notice, everything else seems manageable\n\ntry one more replacement, what other options are there right now? i dont think it looks or feels cheap. i like same things as you, the usb c on both sides, i like the weight and solid feel, the shiny bright screen, speakers, fast solid bt and wifi, keyboard, low bloatware, amazing battery and playing gta v\n\nmy bt 5.3/4 can let me use my earphones all the way in the shower room which i couldnt do with my previous 5.1 or whatever, thats big life immprovement for me\n\ni feel the top function row of keys the backlight bleeds through the bottom of the row a bit much depending on angle but not a big deal",
  "This is a very interesting review. Currently not many reviews for this model. Have you got chance to try other Lunar Lake models?",
  "Nice review! Would you mind sharing how the Aura's screen compares to the SL7 you previously had? And how the fan noise in the SL7 was for you in the same setup you mentioned with external monitor?",
  "Thanks for this insightful review.\nRegarding the fan noise, is it possible to use tpfancontrol (or more recent) to customise it ? On both T15 (Gen 1) and L14 they work well to start the fan sooner than the firmware does, but I do not know whether it is possible to delay the fan startup...\nThanks,\nP.S. : additional question : what is the lowest rpm that tpfancontrol can achieve ?",
  "I noticed a big difference in performance after uninstalling the bloatware. Battery is great, response is snappy, touchpad is fine, not great, screen is lovely. Does everything I need it to do but couldn’t handle Spotify for some reason. Took up all the cpu and memory and crashed the computer. Got rid of it and everything has been great since. Best non Mac I’ve ever owned, and I think the x1 carbon will be better in terms of build quality but couldn’t see myself doubling the cost for materials and same specs. \n\nAll in all, a very solid, reliable piece of equipment.",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",
  "For me, the biggest issues so far:\n\n1. Occasional phantom touches - similar to the OP\n\n2. eGPU compatibility (GPD G1) - it used to work with meteor lake laptop which I had (YogaBook 9i). Now I am not able to make it work stably with the aura. It will work for a minute or 2, then it will start to get disconnected, sadly.",
  "  \nI have had this laptop for a week. I have updated everything that needed updating (Windows and all relevant drivers). Everything is fine except for the Wi-Fi, which is very slow. I usually connect it to my phone’s hotspot (an S23 Ultra), and when I tested it with Ookla Speedtest, the download speed never exceeded 180 kb/s (0.18 Mb/s), while the upload speed reached up to 4 Mb/s. It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do? I bought this from BestBuy in the U.S., but I’m currently not in the United States. While returning it is not impossible, it would be very difficult, and I would prefer to resolve the issue without having to return it.",

  "u/AetherSprite970 Your reviews are excellent and so helpful. Thank you! As a person constantly suffering from eye strain, you've made me aware of the importance of looking beyond just the basic screen specs. In this case, this laptop is an absolute no-go for me based on your experience. I am wondering if iPads suffer from the same problem. I always thought my iPad Pro M1 should give me the most pleasant viewing experience of all my devices, but after just 10 minutes, my eyes hurt like crazy. Is it possible that modern iPads can cause eye strain too?",
  "regarding the Surface Laptop 7, why do you say that arm64 was a too big obstacle? because of some specific application?",
  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues. And if anyone has solved the above issues i'd like to know how to fix it. (I tried bloat removal and even windows reinstall but the issue still persists)",

  "I currently have the G16 and the aura and when it comes to speaker quality, these two are pretty close. the G16 has a slightly fuller bass and slightly wider sound stage. In my opinion if the G16 are a 10, the Aura speakers are a 9.5. I also feel the browsing experience to be much better on the Aura. I experience more lag on the G16 and the fans kick on, the SOC can get too hot for the G16 to sit on the lap, even with light browsing. That being said the track pad on the G16 is better. while the keyboard on the Aura is much better",
  "I was thinking of buying this but it has way too much bass, since I listen to music a lot that's a dealbreaker for me. Also, the bass resonates across the laptop body which creates a weird sensation if you're typing while listening to music.

I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve. The chassis would get way too warm in heavier tasks and the fan would hardly do anything. But still, I prefer the SL7's acoustics. No noise in a docked setup.",

If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far.

  "Ah, interesting. Looks like a universal issue then.",
  "Both are glossy glass surfaces, but I remember the SL7 looked less reflective. The aura can look a bit mirror-like at times.",
  "My bluetooth is awful.  I can pair all devices, but they will NOT stay connected.

Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge.

  "hi I am someone using this laptop for a month. Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo.

I've also watched some review videos on YT about it but most of them are sponsored  by HONOR so I dont rly know how objective these reviews rly are. But I must say I rly like the magnetic Camera feature and it would be also one of the reasons I would but it. Now I especially would use it for Office works and daily tasks, browsing, writing docs..... Also the use of streaming services for YT/Movies and TV Shows. Another factor ofc would be the battery life, that would be especially important for me when using it im School. Thanks in advance for your help! :)",
  "My biggest worry would be to get parts or support if something goes wrong. I don't believe you'll find a replacement keyboard, screen or battery for consumer laptops in general, let alone a niche brand.",
  "Pretty great in terms of hardware but the Snapdragon elite has turned out to be awfully supported by software unlike the Apple Silicon. You should avoid buying unless you know all the software you’re going to use has an arm version available to install otherwise get their intel counterparts. But overall very good laptop and especially the display.",
  "Using one for a year and the one in the title for half a year, pretty good build quality, decent enough preice to performance and good tech support, feels like I've stumbled on a hidden gem so far",
  "yea I've heard abt it, like the change from x to arm software or sth like that? But does it also mean that in the future the Snapdragon ones would be a better option than the Intel ones or no difference between them?",
  "Intel and AMD use the x86 architecture, which is outdated compared to Snapdragon, which uses ARM. ARM is, by design, a generational upgrade—it was meant to be efficient and powerful, and it has finally reached a point where it can match desktop computers in performance. The problem is that Microsoft has a terrible ecosystem; even their own Windows apps are often several versions behind on their latest OS when compared to Apple, which maintains tight control over its ecosystem and has a much better software update lifecycles. \n\nTechnically, ARM is the future, but if I were to buy a Windows laptop today, I would prefer AMD first, then Intel, and lastly Snapdragon, because it’s risky to invest in a product being sold on promises. If ARM on Windows improves significantly over the next few years, I’d consider reselling the laptop and buying a new one—but personally, I don’t like betting on promises.  \n\nThat said, it all depends on your workflow. When I first bought the Apple M1, I knew it would feel like being a beta tester—constantly finding workarounds and dealing with issues. But I also knew it wasn’t my only work device; I had a desktop and an older laptop I could use if something didn’t work. So it was a manageable risk—think about it that way. Similarly, I bought an Android tablet a decade ago, back when they weren’t really mainstream, but only for entertainment and experimentation. If you need a device for important work and there are no easy workarounds, it’s probably not worth it yet.",
  "What a good answer that is sir. Well said everything and completely agrees with you.",
  "thank you🫡",
  "I deliberately bought an ARM laptop to 'beta test' the architecture.\n\nAs long as you aren't running software on it, like anything from adobe or most games, then it's completely usable. Libreoffice for some reason is not usable despite claiming to support. Games from MHY have official support and run really well.",
  "No, I would just use ift for Office work and Streaming Tv shows and Music. I wouldnt play games on it. Just want sth that would be good for daily work with decent battery life....",
  "Microsoft office works great so it would probably be just fine for you.",
  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience). I have a Lenovo duet 5 now which I love but the snapdragon is feeling a little long in the tooth when I have more than a few tabs open.\n\nI guess my heart says Lenovo but brain said MacBook Air.",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop. Having good speakers is a great bonus for the Lenovo for me, as well as a bright screen. Don't need maximum power as for heavy workload I want to rely on remote desktops.",
  "Check your local best buys, in my area (SE Michigan) the Lenovo is on BB as a used excellent for $530 which is the right price point. So see if you can find one in your area for that price",
  "Unfortunately not near me but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nWhat do you think the chances of the kompanio lasting close to apple silicon?",
  "Not sure, thats a ChatGPT quesiton lol \n\nHappy hunting, hopefully you can find one soon.   I hear that they are high-end Chromebooks with Spandragon x Elite processors coming; I'm hoping they are here just before the holiday season.",
  "Ended up with the m4 MacBook air. It went on sale on Amazon for 750(!) and I can't find the Lenovo near me. Also mixed in the surface laptop for fun but the air just seems too good. Thanks again for your help!",
  "HP Elitebook Ultra G1i Full Review Hey r/laptops,\n\nFirst full review here. I'm a recent convert (or attempted convert) from the world of macOS. For context, I've been daily driving a 2018 15\" Intel MacBook Pro for the past six years and reasons I won’t bore you with, I decided it was time to jump back into the Windows world.\n\nMy initial plan was to wait for reviews of a few more Intel Lunar Lake laptops before making a move. But, as fate would have it, my trusty MacBook met an untimely demise (coffee, laptops, and kids don't mix), so I was forced to upgrade immediately. \n\n**My needs**:\n\nComing from a MacBook, battery life was super important. I wasn't expecting miracles, but I needed something that could realistically get me through a transatlantic flight or a full day of cafe work on a single charge. My workload is heavily productivity-focused: emails, Google Docs, PDFs, Office suite (Word, PowerPoint), Slack, Teams, web browsing, and the usual social media (primarily Facebook/Messenger). I also do light Python coding in VS Code occasionally.\n\nMy first attempt was the Asus Zenbook S14. On paper, it looked promising, but two things killed it for me. First, the non-haptic trackpad was a bigger hurdle than I anticipated. After years with one, it felt like a significant downgrade in daily usability to go to a precision trackpad. Second, and more critically, it flat-out refused to work with my external USB-C display (Dell U3219Q). This was a dealbreaker for me, so it went back to BestBuy. \n\nAfter the Zenbook, I was now specifically looking for a 14\" laptop with a haptic trackpad, Intel Lunar Lake (mainly for optimized battery life and compatibility), and premium build quality. Price wasn’t really an object. I just wanted the right machine.\n\nDell  XPS was out due to the function row layout (no physical keys. The one thing I hated about my Macbook Pro). I briefly considered Surface Laptops, even without Lunar Lake, but the lack of USB-C charging ports on both sides felt like a bizarre step back after years of convenience. It's a small thing, but these little annoyances add up.\n\nI ended up zeroing in on the new HP EliteBook lineup. Specifically, the EliteBook Ultra G1i and the EliteBook X G1i. Initially, the X G1i was more appealing due to the built-in HDMI port (less dongle life) and the lack of an expandable USB-A port like the Ultra (less potential for mechanical failure down the line). However, the X G1i had three dealbreakers: no haptic trackpad (again!), no OLED display (the LCD isn't bezel-less), and the baffling placement of the Page Up/Page Down keys above the side arrow keys – a recipe for accidental key presses.\n\nSo, I bit the bullet and went for the HP EliteBook Ultra G1i. I opted for the configuration with 32GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, with a plan to upgrade the storage later (it uses a standard 2280 NVMe drive).\n\n**HP EliteBook Ultra G1i – The Review:**\n\n**Build Quality:**\n\nGenerally excellent. Very close to my Macbook. The chassis feels solid and premium. My only real gripe here is display wobble!! The hinge itself is tight and holds the screen at any angle, but the display panel itself is surprisingly wobbly. Even when stationary, it seems overly sensitive to vibrations and movement. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s definitely noticeable and less refined than I expected. See video below where I have it next to my work laptop which is a 14\" Macbook pro. I tap the table a bit with my leg and the wobble is pretty noticeable.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1izv3v7/video/peee1onmxrle1/player\n\nI also noticed a minor annoyance with the up arrow key. It feels mushy compared to the rest of the keyboard, which is a bit jarring in an otherwise premium experience.\n\n**Keyboard:**\n\nApart from the one mushy key, the keyboard overall is a strong point. Coming from a MacBook, the keys require a bit more actuation force, but they are satisfyingly clicky and tactile. I was able to get up to my usual touch-typing speed quickly. Key travel is good, and overall, no complaints about the typing experience itself. My only minor quibble is the font choice on the keycaps. It’s fine, but I think a slightly different font or a smaller text size on the keys would look nicer. Purely subjective, though.\n\n  \n**Haptic Trackpad:**\n\nThis was a major selling point for me, and thankfully, the haptic trackpad is good. It replicates the feel of a physical click pretty well. However, I did notice a couple of quirks. There seems to be a subtle difference in pressure sensitivity – it feels like it requires slightly more pressure to click towards the top of the trackpad compared to the bottom.\n\nMore noticeably, I found that palm rejection isn't perfect. If the palm of my other hand rests slightly on the trackpad, clicks can sometimes fail to register. Also, and this might be a Windows thing (coming from macOS), you can't two-finger scroll and click simultaneously. On macOS, I'm used to being able to two-finger scroll and then click without lifting my fingers. On the EliteBook, you have to lift your fingers from the trackpad before clicking for the click to register. It took me a while to realize this was happening and why some clicks were being missed.\n\n**Display:**\n\nThe OLED display is gorgeous. Colors are vibrant (if not a bit too vibrant at times), blacks are inky deep, and everything just pops. However, and it's a significant \"however,\" it is **incredibly reflective.** It’s like working in front of a mirror in bright environments. While the display is sharp and detailed, it's not bright enough to effectively combat the glare in well-lit spaces. In my typical dimly lit workspace, it’s fine, but in brighter conditions, the glare becomes a real problem, more so than I experienced with my MacBook Pro’s display.\n\n**Camera:**\n\nWecam is fine, although my skin tone is really off and colors are over-saturated. This isn't just an OLED display issue. When I'm on a meeting, other people look fine, while I look either jaundiced or red as a tomato. The Poly Camera Pro software that comes installed weirdly doesn't allow me to adjust the white balance. This issue aside, the resolution and quality itself is great. It's just the colors are a bit weird.  \n\n**Performance:**\n\nPerformance-wise, the EliteBook Ultra G1i is snappy and responsive for my productivity workload. As I mentioned, I'm mostly doing a bunch of productivity work, some light coding, and general web browsing. It handles everything I throw at it without breaking a sweat, and stays very quiet. Apart from initial setup, I basically never heard the fans. For my use case, performance is more than adequate.\n\n**Battery Life: The Unforgivable Sin**\n\nAnd now we come to the absolute dealbreaker: battery life. It is, in a word, abysmal. I’m consistently getting only 4-5 hours of real-world use, maybe 6!! And this is regardless of what I'm doing. Whether I'm just browsing the web in Edge, working in Google Docs, or doing anything else, the battery life hovers around the 5 hour mark. I have yet to break the 8-hour barrier, let alone reach the double-digit figures I was hoping for.\n\nI consider myself fairly tech-savvy, and I’ve gone through all the usual stuff: checking startup apps, monitoring process usage, disabling unnecessary browser extensions, tweaking power settings – all to no avail. I can only conclude that HP hasn't properly optimized battery management on this laptop yet, or the hardware is simply power-hungry.\n\nFor a modern ultraportable in this price range, and especially one marketed towards business professionals, this battery life is simply unacceptable. It completely defeats the purpose of portability and long work sessions away from a power outlet. My old 2018 MacBook Pro, even with its old battery, often lasted longer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a tough one. The HP EliteBook Ultra G1i has a lot going for it. The build quality is generally excellent, the keyboard and trackpad are good (albeit with some quirks), and the OLED display is stunning (if overly reflective). Performance is more than sufficient for productivity tasks. However, the catastrophic battery life completely overshadows all its positives. For a laptop that is supposed to be a premium, ultraportable business machine, lasting only 4-5 hours on a charge is simply not good enough. It fails in its fundamental purpose as a portable device in 2025.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I've decided to return the HP EliteBook Ultra G1i. It’s a shame, as I wanted to love this laptop. But battery life is a non-negotiable for me, especially at this price point (I dropped $2,300 USD on this). I’ll be going back to using my work laptop while I do more research and wait for more Lunar Lake (and maybe AMD Strix Point?) options to become available and reviewed.\n\nHappy to answer any questions you have about my experience with the EliteBook Ultra G1i. Hopefully, this review will help others in their laptop search!",
  "I've been daily driving a Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition 15.3\" Lunar Lake 258V 32GB 4TB SSD (upgraded) for a while. Similar productivity focused use. Easily getting 10+ hours out of it. Sometimes I don't charge it for two days or so if I don't do video calls. Excellent build quality, keyboard, and display. No haptic touchpad though, but I have never used one and am comfortable with this.",
  "Thanks for the helpful review. My choice came down to this one and the Lenovo Thinkapd X9.\n\nHave you checked out the new Lenovo Thinkpad X9 14\" ? Antiglare OLED (30-120 Hz VRR); Haptic touch, Lunar Lake, Thin and light, strong build quality but \"only\" 55 Wh battery. However, this should last at least 10hours. Check out Andrew's Review Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRuzefBwUVQ&t=324s&ab\\_channel=AndrewMarcDavid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRuzefBwUVQ&t=324s&ab_channel=AndrewMarcDavid)\n\nWhat you can also consider is maybe Snapdragon X Elite Laptops, Even more efficent than Intel / AMD and with better performance. I am currently typing on a Lenovo Slim 7x. Overall its great but I will probably switch to X9 because there some (minor) X86 apps I need (plus I prefer an antiglare screen).\n\nEDIT: I just ordered the X9",
  "How big is the battery? 5 to 6 hours is achievable on my old ZBook workstations and they're not exactly designed around efficiency.",
  "Do you remember what power (Windows) / performance profile (myHP) you were using? I'm on a much older Elitebook (G8 generation with \\~50Wh) and I still get \\~5 hours of light browser use on the original battery + 80% charge cap.",
  "Intel Core Ultra 7 268v supports PCIE 5x4 ... Yet the drives that ship with the Elitebook Ultra G1i are specced at PCIE 4x4. I am wondering however if upgrading the drive to a Samsung PRO 9100 PCIE 5x4 drive would be possible, with the Elitebook supporting full PCIE 5.0 speeds? Could anyone provide any insight here?",
  "AFAIK, both the X G1i and G1a has OLED options.",
  "so has there been updates to improve the battery life?",
  "Great review. Quite a niche question, but do you know if it's possible to 'write' on the screen with a passive stylus? I only ask as the HP EliteBook 8 G1i is so much lighter than the Flip alternative. My needs are to annotate pdf's, but I'd rather lose the 'artistic' functionality of the FLIP and shave 200g lugging it around. Appreciate you'd also lose the active stylus accuracy etc, but for simple note taking (I'm thinking the equivalent of a fingertip writing)... could be just the job.",
  "Here's [my review](https://www.reddit.com/r/elitebook/comments/1meprmh/hp_elitebook_x_flip_g1i_review/). I had quite different experience. Battery life should be WAAAAAYYYY better than that. Did you have it in Performance Mode the whole time? That would make a massive difference.",
  "[therewasonceaman123](https://www.reddit.com/user/therewasonceaman123/) i had exactly the same experience with the elitebook ultra g1i. i really loved the portability, was very fast, screen was good, good resolution, fantastic haspic touchbad, good keyboard But at the end there were 2 things i could not really handle, it was the screen wooble and the screen door effect. The wooble was almost constantly when typing or just using it. But the major reason was the screen door effect. Yes i know it is not as bad as cheap Zenbbook but still there and noticeable for me.\n\nI am so glad that i have read this thread otherwise i wouldnt even have known that there was a surface laptop 7 with intel. I had the qualcomm intel but found it quite slow, as it was emulating most of my software. now i have the business intel ultra 7 and i just love it.",

I hv no issue with brute the hinges nor any wobbly screen. The whole unit just feels very solid n well built except it can be a magnet for fingerprint smudges. Battery life easily last 10-12hrs when Im working on MS office/ SAP ERP/ occasional Power Bi / Teams video calls / browsing on Edge basically  all the office tasks. So good that Im considering to get one myself for personal use, maybe the cheaper Elitebook with ARM snap elite for longer battery life. Highly recommended the HP elitebook for its aesthetic n durability.",
  "Hi - I recently picked up a HP Elitebook X G1a and it has Win 11 25H2 installed. While it seems to be running OK, when the device goes to Sleep for an extended period of time, it crashes and powers off. When I wake the devices it prompts you to login as if started up from shutdown.  None of the prior apps are open, etc. It seems to work OK if put into hibernation mode but Windows 11 sleep mode. It working. I’ve tried disabling Windows Fast Startup and installing all available Windows Updates. I’ve tried both the HP AMD chipset and video drivers as well as the latest available AMD Adrenaline drives directly from AMD website. Upon reviewing the Event Viewer, it appears something is causing it to consistently encounter repeated unexpected shutdowns.  I believe it has something to do with AMD ACPI issues but cannot quite tell.  Was hoping someone might be able to assist before I return/RMA this unit.  Thanks.",
  "It looks like a beautiful laptop. I considered it, and it's 14\" sibling and the 9i too (though that one has a weird extra column of keys and an under display webcam), but I can't live without the haptic trackpad. Glad you're enjoying it and getting great battery life!",
  "Thanks for the feedback. I did see the Thinkpad X9. Actually I would have bought it, but for some reason I don't like the engine hub design. I prefer an even thickness laptop. This looks really weird to me. But it looks like it might work for you. Let me know how you like it! \n\nI did consider snapdragon but like you I have a couple pieces of software that don't play well with them (I tried) so I decided I wanted to go lunar lake.",
  "It's a 64 WHr battery. Middle of the pack for what I've seen on Lunar Lake laptops.",
  "Your old Zbook Fury wouldn't have a 120hz OLED 2.8K touchscreen panel.  That is why the battery drain is so severe on the Elitebook Ultra.  Simply dropping the refresh rate to 60hz will net you a 30% battery life gain.  Take away touch screen and you get another 20-30% in battery life gain.  That alone will get you from a 5-6hr device to almost 10 hours alone.  But for any device right now with a 2.8K 120hz OLED touchscreen panel, the battery life is going to be abysmal unless you put a 90WHr battery in it.  Then the device will be much heavier and not as sleek.",
  "What's interesting is that the myHP app doesn't have any  power profiles itself and just kicks you back to windows, where I have it set to balanced. I'm really wondering if they're still ironing out the kinks in their software. It just doesn't make sense.",
  "Answering my own question … Yes the HP Elitebook Ultra 1Gi does support PCIE 5.0 drives … Crystal Diskmark just delivered a first benchmark with read speeds going up to 14071 MB/s on a Samsung PRO 9100 2tb 🔥",

  "The keyboard and screen reflection is also dogshit, which i can't really tolerate",
  "The Lenovo Thinkpad x1 carbon gen 13 has a haptic track pad option. The haptic track pad is not available yet in the US but I believe some markets have already gotten the option.",
  "Have you considered the ThinkPad X9 14\"?",
  "So my initial thoughts, X9 itself is great but the amazing screen unfortunately has a screen door effect and it is hard to ignore it. My Slim 7x does not have the effect. The non-touch FHD OLED for X9 is far less appealing.\n\nThe \"enginge hub\" is not an issue at all, you barely notice it and you get used to it quickly.\n\nI am looking for alternatives:\n\nX1 Carbon Gen 13 (OLED Matte screen) with haptic or new Microsoft Laptop for Business, also haptic and great screen. (IPS, anti reflective).\n\nWhat do you think?",
  "That probably plays a role. My ZBook 17 G8 can do 5 - 6 hours running web tasks even with its full fat hardware purely due to its battery being big enough to compensate.\n\nBe interesting to see a lunar lake machine with a battery of equivalent size.",
  "I mean it does have the 4K dreamcolor panel, which on the G8 and newer is a 120hz unit - albeit an IPS panel, not OLED. It's also not a touch screen so that probably plays a part.",
  "Thanks, any idea how to reinstall windows on the new disk?",
  "Thanks for the feedback. I actually ended up getting the Microsoft Surface Laptop for Business. I love it. Build quality is even better than the HP Elitebook Ultra. I have two complaints that I've just learned to overlook. The first is a lack of USB-C ports on both sides of the laptop. An annoying issue I haven't had to think about in many years. The second is that when the laptop is plugged in, and under load, there's a tiny bit of coil whine coming from the charger port. Seems like an issue with the surface laptop as I found other posts where people are complaining about this on the snapdragon model. But as I said, I'll learn to live with both. I think this is the best we've got for the time being. I'm happy to answer questions about the laptop if you have any.",
  "Likely one of the 16inch?",
  "I just used the HP Cloud Recovery USB disk",
  "What is your experience / impression now?\n\nHow is the screen (reflection)?\n\nHave you considered the following?\n\n\\- X1 Carbon Gen 13 - ticks a lot of boxes, not sure if I like the \"corporate\" style\n\n\\- X1 2in1 Gen 10 --> Nice Aluminium version with touch but probably also has screen door effect\n\n\\- X9 with FHD+ OLED 400 nits 60Hz Screen, actually for a 14\" inch it might be alright.",
  "I'm happy with the Surface Laptop. I'm going to be keeping it. The screen is not as reflective as my old Macbook as is on par or slightly less reflective than my work MBP, but certainly not as matte as the newest generation of MacBooks. My only real complaint at the moment is the lack of a USB-C port on both sides of the laptop. \n\nI'm not a fan of the corporate style of the X1, and don't like the 2 in 1 form factor either. The X9 might work for you, but 400 nits is kinda low. The Surface Laptop is 600 nits, moderately anti-reflective, but it's not an OLED display. \n\nGood luck with your search!",
  "4 months later. Are you still happy with your purchase?\n\nI am currently trying to choose between the Surface Laptop 7, X1 Carbon, EliteBook Ultra g1i and EliteBook X g1a.\n\nAnd I was wondering, why didn't you originally consider the EliteBook X g1a with the much more powerful ryzen 9 hx 375 chip?  \nAlso, what windows resolutions scaling do you use?  \nDid you find a natural scaling spot where the text was larger or smaller than with the 2880x1800 panels vs the 2304x1536 found in the surface?  \nHas the coil while gotten better or worse, or do you simply not think about it anymore? Also does it only come from the surface connect charger or also when using usb-c charging?  \nHow is the battery life for demanding tasks?",
  "Yes, I'm happy with the surface laptop! It's not perfect, but I don't have any major regrets. \n\nI didn't consider the elitebook X g1a because it didn't have a haptic track pad and it has the split right/left arrow keys with the page up/down buttons which I despise. It's an abomination. \n\nI'm using 150% scaling at full resolution and that's perfect for me. No complaints there. \n\nThe coil whine is still present when plugged in, but I don't really notice it anymore most of the time as I'm usually very focused when I'm working or have headphones on. I'm also on battery most of the time. I think I noticed it for the first time in months just the other day. So not bad. \n\nI haven't actually ever used the surface connect charger. It's still wrapped up in the box. I carry a single USBC charger and cable with me for all my devices and don't feel like carrying another. It certainly would have been nice to have a USBc port on the right side of the laptop for this reason, and it's caused me an issue twice now, but I've learned to live with it. \n\nThe battery life is... Okay. I really don't know how reviewers are getting the insane battery life they're reporting. For my Macbook which I had used in an identical manner I was getting 50% or so more battery life out of it. That's really the only thing that's making me miss Apple. For my overall work style, their battery life is just superior!",
  "Thanks for the answers! One final question for you. Do you notice any screen door effect due to the touchscreen even though it's IPS and not OLED?",
  "You're welcome! Nope I don't see any screendoor effect. The display is great! I wish it were brighter, but that's it. Good luck with your decision!",
  "I had exactly the same. i had the elitebook ultra g1i and i loved it expect two things made me return it. 1. was the screen door effect which was notable to me althought high resolution. it was not real bad like on cheap zenbook but still there and it botherd me when browsing, read news, on hight brightness. 2. the screen wooble was bad too, sit on sofa, touch the screen wooble, type wooble. the rest i really loved, portable, fast, oled. now i also have the surface laptop 7 and i love it. i wish is was ratio 16:10 instead 3:2 but i can live with it.\n\nthe screen door effect comes onyl with oled displays, and it depends on ppi, the higher and the higher the resolution the better it should be. The worst ive seen so far are on Asus Zenbooks. IPS display never have a metal mesh. Surface Laptop has PixelSense which also not has a mesh.",
  "Asus ExpertBook P5 (P5405) Review I just got the Asus ExpertBook P5 with 32gb RAM and here are my impressions from a few days of using it. My review isn't based on any benchmarks but instead based on my regular daily use.    \n  \nI like the clean/simplistic design and I'm impressed by the Lunar Lake performance (it's life changing for me coming from a 3-year old Intel laptop that lasts 2-3 hours on battery). I picked the Expertbook P5 over the Zenbook S14 because of the lower price point and ventilation design, which allows me to use it with the lid closed while docked without losing performance (I am assuming that the S14 would lose some performance since the ventilation grills above the keyboard would be blocked with the lid closed but please correct me if I'm wrong). \n\n* **Battery Life:** In my experience the battery life lasted 8-9 hours in a regular office work environment, which I define as having Chrome open with several tabs, listening to music, and working on some basic desktop apps like Office365/Google Drive suite. However, it seems the Zenbook S14 battery lasts almost twice as much from the benchmark tests I've seen online, which doesn't make sense to me since it only has a 15% larger battery (72 Wh vs 63 Wh). If this is a Chrome battery drain bug, hopefully a future BIOS update can fix it. On a similar note, when I first booted the laptop the battery wasn't charging but the issue was fixed after I downloaded a BIOS update that was already available.\n* **Build Quality:** This is a big negative for me. The touch pad feels like a loose piece of plastic and it makes a click noise even with the slightest touch which is bothersome. The keyboard feels cheap and some keys make a crackling noise if you try to move them slightly with your finger tips. I also have an issue where the laptop fan makes a click noise every time it starts, which is not a big deal but can get annoying when you hear it every time. Additionally the lid creaks a bit when opening and closing the laptop. When I first got the laptop it didn't lay perfectly flat on the table, so I had to twist it a bit and now it's even.\n* **Software:** The laptop also comes with a bunch of bloatware (McAfee and Asus software) but at least it can be uninstalled. I tried the Asus Business AI tools that are supposed to be unique about this laptop but they are not that useful IMO (but in fairness it's in beta). The video transcript / summary tool is slow and seems to be processing stuff on the cloud (not locally), and other features like having a business card overlay on your webcam is silly.\n* **Price:** I think the price point ($1100 to $1300) compared to other Lunar Lake laptops in the market right now is pretty good, specially since the P5 comes with a 3-year warranty for no additional cost. \n\nOverall I give the Expertbook P5 a score of 6 out of 10. It's almost a good laptop but I can't get over the build quality and the business tools don't seem useful to me. I think for now I will wait for more Lunar Lake ultrabooks to come out and throw in a few more bucks to get better quality. Lunar Lake is an amazing upgrade but right now I feel like some manufacturers are trying to rush these into the market. I am in need of one of these laptops badly so I'm just waiting for the right one to come out, but it's definitely not the Expertbook P5.",
  "That's interesting, hence there is only 1 review on Youtube about this new guy from Asus, and it was quite positive... What about the sound? and its display? It's supposed to be awesome, isn't it? At least for me, it's only one laptop with IPS 2k without PWM and +- normal battery life.... However, the question is - can be the build quality and shitty webcam a deal breaker... Now I can't see direct competitors in that price range and IPS + Luna Lake...\n\n  \nAny ideas?",
  "I wouldn't stress too much about the battery part, I've never even remotely achieved the battery life tested in reviews with any laptop.\n\nThey just click run on a battery benchmark or let it play back a video, this isn't applicable to actual usage.\n\nIf you got 8-9 hours of genuine office work, Chrome, YT running in the background, cloud sync etc., that's a very good result in my experience.\n\nI've also pre-ordered the ExpertBook P5, but no shipping info so far. The build quality sounds like a downer, but could be unit to unit variance. If mine is as bad as yours, I'll just return it.",
  "I purchased this laptop too. Chose it over last gen processors that were heavily discounted. The screen is very good in my opinion. Sound is also pretty good for casually watching movies and video conferencing. Might need a little tweaking like turning off unnecessary spatial sound and such. On my unit, there are no issues with creaking of the lid and the touch pad. Keyboard feels pretty standard to me, maybe a bit heavier actuation for my taste. I am not sure if it is the fan but the laptop makes constant crunching noises like there is and silent HDD inside and not SSD. Have not tested the battery life that thoroughly yet so I cannot speak to that. Maybe it can be the higher refresh rate? By default it was set to 60Hz but I did put it to 144Hz.\n\n  \nOverall a good package for me. Only real issue for me is the webcam quality. I would have paid more for a better one.",
  "There are some more reviews coming in , found this one: [https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ExpertBook-P5-P5405-laptop-in-review-Intel-s-M1-moment-in-a-business-laptop.910455.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ExpertBook-P5-P5405-laptop-in-review-Intel-s-M1-moment-in-a-business-laptop.910455.0.html)",
  "You should really try to test the performance on battery. I have the same model and I noticed that the performance drastically decreases on battery, so is the package power draw. From 35-37w while plugged in down to 25w for a short time(about 10 seconds) then down to 15w. This decreases Cinebench R23 scores down to 7800 multicore, but the one that suffers most is the GPU, as it struggles to keep the clocks high enough for for it to be considered usable. Any idea as to why did they artificially limit performance while competitors such as the Lenovo 7i Aura with the same CPU can keep the plugged in performance while on battery?",
  "I've had mine a few weeks and don't have any of the quality or noise issues OP described. Maybe I got lucky or they were unlucky. It's definitely not a premium laptop like a Macbook or Surface, but it's close and appropriately less expensive. It has some practical benefits that some more expensive options lack like a matte screen and extra M2 slot. Light, fast, quiet, and relatively cheap.\n\nAlways annoyed I have to peel off stickers and uninstall bloatware, but that seems to be unavoidable on Windows laptops unless you get a Surface.",

  "I want to confirm the sound made by the fans when they start.\n\nIt also feels like a \"haptic vibration\" when you have the hands on the laptop.\n\nThe fact that several people have encountered this makes me think that it is a kind of manufacturing defect and not a particular defect on my laptop.\n\nApart from this, the laptop meets expectations:\n\n* solid\n* good screen\n* decent keyboard and touchpad",
  "I recently got this laptop. Agree with most of your points. My biggest problem is the trackpad. it definitely feels loose and cheap and not for extended use. My unit makes an odd electric noise i can hear from the bottom.   \nBattery lasts between 7-10hs with casual use on 80% brightness (7h if i go 144hz and closer to 10h if i do 60hz+ windows battery settings). I actually quite liked the keyboard. Never tried thinkpads but I liked mine better than macbooks (deeper travel, better feel). screen is good, not on par with oleds but at least its matte and not glossy. ports (2 type-c TB4 and 2 type-A + HDMI) and extra ssd + replacable network card are great. My fans don't make that sound you mentioned, but they do turn on and off in daily use a lot, but i don't hear them. Overall i'd give it an 8/10. Only if the trackpad was better and battery was closer to what was advertised.",
  "Surface or Aura",
  "Yeah I've seen that Youtube review and I'm wondering why there aren't any others. The Expertbook P5 seems to be out of the radar for a lot of people.\n\nThe sound and the display are good. The only area where the display could be better is extra brightness. The P5 only goes up to 400 nits brightness, whereas some of the more premium Lunar Lakes go up to 500 nits. If you are working in an outdoor environment the extra 100 nits could be useful. Indoors I was using the second highest brightness setting (that's what went into my 8-9 hour battery life test).\n\nAgree on price point... the other one I'm considering is the Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition (15″ Intel) Laptop but it's $200 more and it's a 15\" laptop (vs 14\" P5).",

  "FWIW it's worth, the best two battery life benchmarks out there are UL's PCMark 10 Modern Office, and its Procyon Microsoft Office battery benchmark. They'll never be perfect as everyone's usage is difference. But, they do offer a consistent, best case scenario comparison across models.",
  "Hey, thank you for your comment. I was considering ordering this laptop, but I really hate these electronic noises that you described.",
  "any update on that noise?",
  "How is your battery life?",
  "Hey I saw your post and was curious about how good the matte screen was? Is there any reflection as that is a deal-breaker for me and hoping that this is not reflective. Thanks in advance for any info.",
  "Anybody who is facing the fan issue have found a solution?",
  "So I've managed to find a solution I think. The good news is that it's not the fan itself making the noise, but another component rattling in there, every time the fan kicks in.\n\nAs you open up the laptop – It's the leftmost metal tab holding the battery into place. When the fan kicks in this metal tab tends to vibrate and hit the opposite bottom plate, where it rattles against an extruded piece of plastic, which amplifies the sound.\n\nTo fix it, you just need to put a piece of electrical tape over it so that it stops vibrating. This solved it 90% for me. I can still hear the fan very faintly if i pay attention, but not as distracting as before.\n\nHere is a visual guide: https://imgur.com/a/L90amx5\n\nLet me know if this works for you.",
  "someone above mentioned there's a piece of metal holding the battery which is the rattling electric sound.\n\nAs for 3 months later, how is it? Are you still a happy customer with it?\n\nHinges still a'ight?",
  "Yes, Yoga is a cool option, however, that glossy display is a deal breaker for me... I can't stand the displays which harm my eyes more than it's necessary...  All my hopes are on an update or other magic from Asus that should fix the issue with the battery, cause there is not a normal explanation for 7-8 hours for the IPS and luna lake",
  "Did you received it? I'm interested in your opinion! thanks you",
  "Nope, my order was through the official Asus store and they've refreshed the expected shipping date to 12. of October.\n\nThey still haven't shipped anything.",
  "Seems nice and matte to me, but I'm sure there's still some reflection. I too am really annoyed by glossy screens and I use this thing all over the house without being aware of reflections.\n\n6 months in now and I'm still really happy with this laptop. It's been a good performer and stable. For the body I'm still happy with the tradeoff of it being high end plastic (top lid is metal) but cheaper and lighter. Only annoyance has been accidentally sliding the physical camera shutter when opening it.",
  "Mine is doing the same clicking sound. I want to try what you suggest however I struggle to open it. Is there a screw in the middle under the rubber bumper ? If yes how did you remove that rubber thing.  Or is it under the stickers ? Thank you very much",
  "This is a review I found that also references the battery problem: [https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/asus-expertbook-lunar-lake-review/](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/asus-expertbook-lunar-lake-review/)\n\nHonestly I would have keep the P5 with a score of 7 or 8 out of 10. Maybe I just got a faulty unit but I felt that I had to return it, otherwise these quality issues would continue to grow over the next 1-2 years. It felt like a laptop that I would only own for a year before wanting to get a new one.",
  "[deleted]",
  "okay! thanks to reply. I will wait for your review!!",
  "I am curious if you've received your laptop and if so, what your impressions are. I am seriously considering it as it hits every single point on my check list. However, if the build is really cheap, that would be a deal-breaker for me.",
  "Awesome. Thank you for this info. I have an Asus ux430u laptop that I bought 8 years ago and it has held up extremely well but it's time for the upgrade. This one seems very similar in style to that with future proof specs. 32gb should hold for several years. \nThe price I'm seeing online is $1,200 which I guess is fair with the specs but just checking if you found any good deals or discounts anywhere. Thanks again for the info.",
  "ok I managed to open it. There is no screw in the middle only on the edges. It seems it indeed solves the clicking noise. The metal battery holders are loose and when fan starts, the air flow moves them and that's the cause of clicking noise. Thank you very much for sharing information",
  "true haha",
  "I've received it by now and the only issue I can confirm is the fan making a click noise when spinning up.\n\nOnce the fan is continuously running, it's quiet compared to most other laptops and doesn't have annoying high pitched noises, but the startup sound is noticeable and quite odd.\n\nThe keyboard is on the louder side, but feels nice to use and is on the same tier as HP ExpertBooks and Thinkpads, no crackling here.\n\nThe lid and keyboard deck feel very solid, I don't have any creaking and I'd say they are comparable with much more expensives laptops.\n\nThe bottom of the device feels a bit flimsy, though. You probably won't touch it a lot, so it's not a huge issue, but it doesn't match the quality of the rest of the device.\n\nI'm getting 10-11 hours of real world light usage (browser, mail, some small code compiles in between), which I've never seen on a non-Mac laptop before.\n\nOverall I'd recommend it, if you aren't too bothered by the fan making a click when it kicks on. I've heard this on industrial fans before, but never on a laptop.",
  "I got it off the Asus site and I think it was on sale for $100 off or something, but that's off the so-called \"regular\" price they make up as well so who knows. I know it was significantly cheaper than the similar spec Zenbook which has the more premium body and screen. But the ExpertBook one being intended for business despite being cheaper has the advantages of a matte screen and extra M2 slot. I also prefer the simple plain style on the lid.",
  "Ok the sound is still there. It seems the root cause is that the fan is loose too. [https://imgur.com/a/WGQrnfx](https://imgur.com/a/WGQrnfx)",
  "Sorry to bug you, but I'm wondering about how loud the fan clicking noise is and how long it lasts. Any chance you have a video or audio clip of it?

  "\"business laptop\" my azz.\n\nI've had a TUF which after severe abuse with work, does this on the CPU fan, but after 5 years I got no business to complain, but that's the \"dirt cheap gaming laptop with questionable QC\", this is supposed to be a business laptop.\n\nThe thing is, finding a decently priced alternative without \"OLED\" display seems impossible these days, lenovo offering either oled or some 60% sRGB crap display on just about anything",
  "It's a single click every time the fan goes from off to on, probably from the electric motor.\n\nIt's not too loud, probably about as loud as a mouse click (different sound profile, though), but it is noticeable. My phone doesn't really capture it well.\n\nIf you are used to a room with a high noise floor due to AC or similar, you probably won't care. If you are used to a more silent environment, you might.",
  "It's not loud, but it definitely gets annoying once you realize it's there. It was strange to me that the fan kept turning on. I ended up settling for the Lenovo Yoga Aura Edition and it doesn't make any clicking noises...",
  "It's very large, glass and uses Windows Precision drivers.   \nIf you've had other laptops with this setup, you know what to expect, there isn't really anything special about it.\n\nIt's not a fancy haptic touchpad, it still has traditional clicks. The clicks are decently quiet and it doesn't have rattle.\n\nIt's a well executed but basic design. The classic 7/10, good but nothing special",

It's a great laptop and lasts me about 8 hours on battery life for typical workday tasks. One tip if you are getting accessories (case / screen protector) is to go for the Macbook Air 15 inch accessories (same screen dimensions).",

  "Thinkpad or Zephyrus My current laptop (Surface Book 2 13.5) is still doing quite well but I'm looking to upgrade, mostly because of performance restraints and reliance on cloud for ML tasks. I work with applied AI but all the tooling I need from work is provided, but I want to have more power for my tinkering outside of work.\n\nI have narrowed it down to 2 options: The Lenovo Thinkpad P1 Gen 7 or the Asus Zephyrus G16\n\n\n\nThe Thinkpad is on sale for £1800 with the following specs:\n\nIntel® Core™ Ultra 7 165H vPro® Processor\n\n4060 8Gb 60W\n\n32Gb (upgradable, but expensive to do so)\n\n1Tb\n\n16\" 3840x2400 IPS 60Hz\n\n\n\nAnd the Zephyrus G16 is more modern and also not on sale (\\~£2650) with the following specs:\n\nIntel® Core™ Ultra 9 Processor 285H\n\n5070ti 12Gb 120(?)W\n\n32Gb (soldered)\n\n1Tb\n\n16\" 2560 x 1600 OLED 240Hz\n\n\n\nMy usage consists of the following:\n\nMy laptop goes about 13 hours between long charges, with 4-6 of those being light usage (coding/web browsing/reading and highlighting academic papers) and the rest is just idle with screen off and shut. I can charge it with a very low wattage USB-C connection when out. When I'm at home and I have the main charger I will often be hooked up via USB-C to an external monitor, I'll do more coding and web browsing but I'll also be running ML models (mostly Graph Neural Networks and Multi Agent RL - not LLMs). I also don't train locally, but having the ability to prototype small models before I send it up to the cloud and leave it to train would be useful. I do also want to perform data processing with pandas locally. Aside from that whilst I do game it's only League of Legends/Minecraft so I don't need to worry about running AAA games. I'm looking to use this laptop for the next 5+ years so having longevity in mind is important, although if the Thinkpad becomes outclassed because it is cheaper I'd be okay with upgrading earlier.\n\nI haven't been able to see either of them in person to get a feel for them, and I can't decide off of specs and reviews alone, so hoping I can get some help deciding. \n\nOne final and somewhat important point is I am British, I prefer the English UK ISO layout - which means a big enter key, if that is or isn't possible on the laptop that does have some sway in my decision.\n\nI am also somewhat open to suggestions. I have also considered:\n\n\\- MacBook Pro - but I need windows/WSL and x86 (as well as NVIDIA for local CUDA)\n\n\\- Framework 16 - I don't think the 16 system is mature enough yet, especially for the cost",

  "Comparing 2020 Macbook Air M1 with Asus TUF F15 AMD Ryzen 7 6800h RTX 3050 Ti I did a search comparing these two laptops because I'm more of a casual user and light gamer. I read some posts comparing these two and rather than making a comment there, I figured for posterity (since these are both pretty old) I would say something about them.\n\nI'm on a budget, not much money to work with but still wanted quality. The 2020 Macbook Air with M1 processor was $650 used on Ebay purchased last year, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD. Has been a rock solid laptop, very lightweight, super efficient and runs the host of great Apple softwares (Final Cut Pro, RAW Power, etc). The Asus TUF F15 gaming laptop was $455 shipped (eBay), purchased last week, 2022 model, Ryzen 7 6800h RTX GeForce 3050 TI, 2TB SSD. If I was a college student right now I would be thrilled with either one of these laptops.\n\nThis is my first Windows machine since 2012. I didn't realize how much I don't miss Windows, what a shitshow, incredible amount of bloat. Macs have zero bloat, no annoying questions, nothing to setup, nothing to delete, just go. The Mac has insane battery life. In 30 mins of typical use it might go from 90% to 88%. The power brick went bad on my Asus TUF few days ago. In 30 minutes I watched the battery go from 90% to 60%, WTF?? I hadn't realized the power brick went bad and it kept switching between 144hz refresh rate and 60hz, switching between performance mode and efficiency mode (I was playing a game).\n\nI should explain my gaming needs which are extremely modest. I play Weird Gun Game on Roblox which isn't graphic intensive. The RTX 3050 Ti is more than sufficient to play that game as well as Counterstrike Source. These are the only 2 games I play and I'm not really worried about \"future proofing\" my rig since I don't even play with max settings on the games I'm playing now. I don't need to see every shadow and every reflection.\n\nI started playing Weird Gun Game a month ago while on vacation and really enjoyed it on my Macbook Air. I kept noticing I was dying before it would even show on my screen which bothered me and realized my Mac has 60hz refresh rate and limited graphic processing power. I will say though, the M1 processor is able to do an adequate job and I would probably be happy if I could simply get the 144hz refresh rate.\n\nI also have a 24\" iMac desktop computer with an M3 processor which does allow better and smoother gameplay. However, like the Macbook, it only has 60hz refresh rate so it's limited. As far as the difference between the M1 and M3 processor, it's not a huge difference, it's subtle, I only notice it here and there, but I can tell it's definitely just a tad bit snappier.\n\nThe biggest surprise I'm experiencing with the jump to the Asus TUF laptop is the lower pings. My latency has dropped significantly with the Asus. Apparently the wifi card (Mediatek) on the Asus is really good. I compare both laptops (Asus and Macbook Air) in the exact same spot in my kitchen table which is approximately 15 feet from the wifi router with no obstructions. The difference in latency: with the Macbook Air playing Weird Gun Game I would get around 90ms. The Asus TUF latency would be around 60ms. It's hard to pin point because the latency is always fluctuating but that's the general number.\n\nObviously, your latency will change during the day due to local network traffics. The best latency I have ever gotten with my Macbook Air is around 70ms-80ms. The best latency I have been able to get with the Asus TUF is around 50ms-60ms. Last nite I was playing and it was hovering around 50ms which for me is just outstanding. I have Cox internet for what it's worth and Apple Airport A1521 Extreme Base Station for my wifi router.\n\nSoon as I got my Asus laptop I started playing Weird Gun Game and suddenly I felt like God. I killed the first 23 people I came across which never happens (I'm not that great). There was an immediate boost in my gameplay and the laptop has exceeded my expectations. Sure, the gameplay is indeed smoother, but I would say the biggest improvement has been to my latency which is something nobody ever talks about when they talk about gaming laptops.\n\nI had done my homework and I knew alot of people were upgrading their wifi cards. I know there's a popular upgrade involving the Intel AX210 chipset. I know my laptop is able to take this upgrade easily since the current Mediatek card is not soldered. The only reason I can find to upgrade though, is that the Intel AX210 chipset uses the 6Ghz band. Kind of pointless since my wireless router doesn't do 6Ghz but at least I know. From what I can tell, I wouldn't really experience much of an upgrade, but there really isn't much discussion on this. Has anyone upgraded from the Mediatek wifi card to the AX210? Did you see a boost in performance or lower latency? I'm really curious.\n\nI'm very grateful to one conversation regarding my router settings. I was able to switch to the 5Ghz band for my wifi router and not only has it improved my gaming experience, it has really improved my overall internet experience. Not only is latency lower, but even simple things have improved. Youtube videos load quicker, websites load quicker, everything feels snappier on the 5Ghz band. I had no idea there would be such an improvement over the 2.4Ghz band (I know, sorry I don't know much about these things). Supposedly the 2.4Ghz band is better for range, but I live in a small condo and don't need to cover a large area.\n\nOne unexpected benefit from my Asus laptop over my Macbook Air is the larger screen. The Macbook Air has only a 13\" screen whereas the screen on the Asus is 15\". I have noticed I enjoy watching Youtube videos much more over the Macbook Air. The Asus TUF F15 feels much more cinematic despite the lower overall quality. When I say quality, I'm talking about specs. The max brightness of my Macbook Air is around 400 nits which is really bright. The Asus max is less than 300 nits which isn't very good, but hasn't been an issue and I haven't really noticed. I also know the color rendition on my Macbook Air is extremely accurate as they are color calibrated from the factory. The color rendition on my Asus TUF laptop is only passable. I can't really tell that it only covers 60% of the color gamut, but then again, I haven't really used it for any hardcore video or photo editing since I do that on my Mac.\n\nAlso, because it's been so long since I have owned a Windows machine, I no longer own any software for Windows. I couldn't edit anything on my Asus laptop now if I tried. I used to own the entire Adobe Photoshop Suite with Premier and all that, but back in 2012, it was a standalone product (not a subscription).\n\nI struggled with the many suggestions about getting an Asus TUF laptop with the RTX 4050 processor. The prices were about $150-$200 more. I also looked at the RTX 3060 which is quite a performance boost over the 3050 Ti but again, it was about $150-$200 more which I just couldn't stomach. I'm really on a pretty strict budget and I'm thrilled with what I've got right now. I feel like I can handle anything, the Macbook Air has outstanding all day battery life and the Asus TUF can pretty much handle any games out there. Maybe it can't handle those games on max settings, but it will run.\n\nRegarding the Nvidia processor, I noticed the Asus TUF laptops for this year (2022) seemed to come with the RTX 3050 Ti compared to the Lenovo LOQ 15IRH8 which only came with the standard RTX 3050 and was around the same price. The \"Ti\" designation apparently offers a performance boost somewhere in the range of 10% - 15% over the standard RTX 3050 card. In real world terms, there probably isn't much of a difference, but considering the price I'm paying I'll take any boost in performance I can get.\n\nI compared lots of reviews between the Lenovo LOQ and the Asus TUF books. The build quality is supposedly better on the Asus models but from what I could see on Youtube reviews, all these laptops are plastic constructions and have considerable flexing in the keyboard and screen, especially compared to my Macbook Air which is a unibody design milled from a single block of aluminum. Comparing the two laptops in build construction isn't a comparison, the Asus TUF feels like a cheap plastic laptop, whereas the Macbook Air feels like it's solid state. There's almost zero flex on the Macbook Air (keyboard or the screen).\n\nNoise - Soon as I load up Weird Gun Game the fans on the Asus start spinning hard and do not stop. The upper right corner of the laptop (on the keyboard portion) gets hot and I can feel the hot air being pushed out from the fans. I'm thinking to place some sort of mesh over the air intakes on the bottom to prevent dusts from building up inside cause that's not something I want to deal with in the future.\n\nI tried to download Armoury Crate which is a software that allows you to tweak the color of the keyboard as well as make other changes. The software isn't downloading properly and I haven't been able to change anything but it's not that big a deal to me. I don't even use the keyboard on the Asus.\n\nSpeaking of keyboards, I was lucky enough to score a used wireless Mac keyboard. This keyboard is far superior to the one on the Asus laptop. I even prefer it over the keyboard on the Macbook Air which feel soft and squishy in comparison. If I had to compare the keyboard on the Asus TUF with the Macbook Air, I would give the nod to the Air. The keyboard travel on the Asus is a little longer which makes makes the Air feel a bit more responsive and snappier. The keyboard on the Asus is just bigger in general and I'm not used to the full size keyboard. None of my Apple stuff (24\" iMac, 27\" iMac, 13\" Macbook Air) offers a full size keyboard. I haven't used a full size keyboard since 2012 so it feels foreign to me. It's a good thing I don't use it to game, although I will say the sepia toned colors which are backlighting the keys does look nice and it's exactly the color I would have picked if I had to get stuck with 1 color.\n\nThe power brick on my Asus laptop went out few days ago and it cost me $35 to replace. The lettering was faded on it and I guess it was really used and really old. Now I'm looking at the battery level which is currently at 80% and the plug is getting disconnected every once in a while, uh oh, looks like I have an issue with the power connector. Maybe I can live with it?",
  "I'm looking at lots of posts and I'm shocked at the budgets y'all have. Damn, $2k??? I wish I had that kind of change. My friend bought an Macbook Air last year with M4 chip she spent around $1,500. She's a casual user and not even in College anymore. I told her to get the M1 Macbook Air but she said she wanted something future proof. I think the M4 Macbook Air is overkill for a casual. Fetching emails, watching Youtube videos and surfing the web has never been processor intensive, this won't be changing  in 5 years. My M1 processor will work just as well for these things in 5 years as they are now. Not to mention, in 3 years I'll be able to purchase that Macbook Air with M4 processor for $650 on eBay and I'll be all caught up.\n\nI think anyone spending $2k on a laptop today for college is just crazy. It's total overkill. At this point, you're simply spending for the sake of future proofing because there's no way you actually need all that power now. You could spend a fraction of that on a Asus TUF with RTX 4050 (can get around $650 used) and that laptop really is future proof.",
  "Tbh for your use case I think something in between would make more sense like a lunar lake chip.\n\nThere is a refurbished Acer laptop with the 226v on sale for 400 on eBay. 2 years warranty as well\n\nYou get similar efficiency to the m1 while also usable gaming performance\n\nhttps://ebay.us/m/9d6cHk\n\nBut yeah if you are more serious about gaming then a dgpu is important",

  "Looking to buy new laptop under 1200 USD Hey Everyone,\n\nTLDR - \n\nLooking to Buy a reliable professional-grade laptop around 300,000 PKR with strong CPU performance, expandable RAM and SSD options, a capable GPU for rendering, decoding, and solid build quality. Preferably new with local warranty support.\n\nAny recommendations or feedback would be highly appreciated.\n\n\\------------------\n\n# Back Story\n\nAfter a long while, I have finally decided to upgrade my laptop, but the current market dynamics is too confusing for me right now esp. between currency hit, price differences, open-box deals, and Masked/refurbished options, it has been difficult to decide on a laptop that truly fits my needs. I would really appreciate some input from the community.\n\n# Current Setup\n\nI’m currently using an HP ProBook 450 G5 (8th Gen). It has served me well, but it’s beginning to show its age, especially under heavier workloads.\n\n# Requirements\n\nCore Specifications\n\nCondition: Brand new preferred  \nCPU: Intel i7 (H-series or equivalent or better)  \nRAM: 24 GB (16 GB minimum with expansion slot - no soldered ones)  \nStorage - (Must be SSD + HDD option)\n\n* SSD 512 GB for OS (second slot for future expansion is a plus)\n* HDD SATA 1 TB (2.5” inch)\n\nDisplay: At least IPS with decent color accuracy & brightness  \nGPU: Nvidia RTX Ada series or something slightly stronger for rendering, encoding/decoding performance. I can work with gaming series but no older than 4000 series.  \n  \nPorts and Connectivity\n\n* Multiple USB A/B/C 2.0/3.0 ports for accessories (mouse, external drives, cooling stand)\n* 3.5 mm audio jack\n* VGA/HDMI port for external display\n* RJ45 LAN port\n* Wi-Fi 4/5 GHz support\n\nKeyboard and Build\n\n* Full-size backlit keyboard (numpad preferred)\n* Rigid build with minimal flex or hinge wobble.

Current system starts to lag with ram & cpu reaching max capacity before apps start crashing.\n* I do not play games on the laptop as I have a ps5 pro for that - so I dont require top end latest GPU.\n\n# Not Considering\n\n* MacBooks, due to hardware/software compatibility issues with some custom tools I use.\n* Touchscreen, 2-in-1, tablets, flipbooks or hand-held devices\n* Desktops, as I often work from multiple client offices and need portability\n\n# Current Thoughts\n\n* I’ve been considering Lenovo ThinkPad T or P Series, but many models seem to use TFT panels by default. \n* HP Victus models have good specifications but poor reviews regarding build quality, screen wobble, and keyboard flex. \n* I’m also uncertain about Intel versus Ryzen options and would appreciate insights on that. \n* My goal is to move to at least an IPS panel, since my current laptop has a TFT. OLED would be ideal, but likely beyond budget.\n\n# Budget: \n\nAround 300,000 PKR\n\n# Important Points\n\n* Models that offer the best balance of performance, portability, display & build quality\n* I would prefer numpad on keyboard but if laptop model is worth it then I can compromise as a trade off.\n\nI know I might be asking for a lot, but any advice or recommendations would really help. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to share their thoughts.",
  "Acer Chromebook Plus 714 Review - A Monarch in the making (for Chromebooks) I’ve long been a fan of Acer Chromebooks, mainly because they were one of the first companies that really took ChromeOS seriously and pushed out multiple devices at different price points so people could actually try the platform out. My very first Chromebook back in 2015 was an Acer (and I’ve owned four Acer Chromebooks since then). I loved that original device, even with its limitations in RAM and power at the time. But Acer has come a long way, and now I’ve got my hands on the new Acer Chromebook Plus 714. This one comes with a premium build, pure power, and unexpectedly great battery life.\n\nIt's not a “new release”, but it's the best Chrombook Acer makes, so I had to check it out as I'm on my journey to find the best new Chrombook for me. So let’s get into it.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmbbq2mxr6qf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d3134b2a3c13e924ed1043ba200030769b02d06\n\nThe design looks sharp. It has a premium feel with gold edges against the dark grey finish. The body is solid aluminum, and it really feels like a top-tier machine in hand. Inside, it switches to plastic, but not the cheap kind. It feels solid, comfortable under your palms and wrists, and there’s no flex when typing.\n\nPort selection is solid: two USB-C ports, an HDMI port (which should honestly be standard on every laptop), a headphone jack (another must-have), and USB-A ports. The downside is both USB-C ports are on the left side, which already caused me an issue with charging since my setup needed a right-side port. They could have easily put one on each side, and it feels like a miss.\n\nFor a device at this price, it should also have a fingerprint scanner, standard in my book for anything over $500, especially a Chromebook.\n\nOn the positive side, it’s a 360-degree convertible, so you can flip it into tablet or tent mode, which is surprisingly useful in tight spaces (like on a plane). But here’s the kicker: some versions of the 714 come with a built-in stylus, and mine didn’t. That should’ve been standard across all models at this price point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hr13bs3zr6qf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27f67b6daff371c0c5a569f5f774116c3d5c630e\n\n**Overall Design & Build: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nThis is always the question that unites man: how long does the battery last? The Chromebook Plus 714 runs on Intel’s new **Core Ultra 5 115U chip**, so I was curious how that would balance performance with efficiency. My past Chromebooks with i5 chips had horrible battery life.\n\nAt first, this one seemed the same, barely a few hours, and even dying overnight in sleep mode. But then, after a few days, something clicked. It optimized itself, and the battery life became excellent.\n\n**My normal workflow includes:**\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web) meets 4-5 hours a day\n* Google Messages app\n* YouTube Music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Brightness around 70%\n\nWith that, it pushes through the day, no problem. Even now in week 2, I charged it 5 days ago, used it an hour or two daily, and it still has 43% left. Whatever optimization Intel and Acer did here worked, because my older HP Chromebook x360 14c with an i3 chip can’t even come close.\n\n**Battery Life: A**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nThe keyboard is good, but not great. I have massive “bearpaw” hands, so I judge every keyboard against the HP x360’s, which still holds the crown for me. This one is fine, with decent travel and good response, but the keys could be just a bit bigger.\n\nThe trackpad is excellent, glass-like, very responsive, accurate, and the perfect size. It does pick up fingerprints easily, but that’s par for the course.\n\nAgain, no fingerprint reader in 2025 for a device at this price range, big miss\n\n**Keyboard: B- | Trackpad: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\n# Speakers & Sound\n\nThis is where Acer cut corners. The speakers are weak, tiny, and honestly feel like they came out of a first-gen Chromebook. No bass, not loud, and just flat overall. Even my phone speakers (iPhone or Galaxy) blow these out of the water. At this price point, they should have borrowed the better speakers from their Windows laptops.\n\n**Speakers: D**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance - Intel Core Ultra 5 115U\n\nThis is the biggest surprise. The new Intel Core Ultra 5 architecture delivers real performance gains in a way I haven’t seen on a Chromebook before.\n\nUnlike the new Lenovo Chromebook with the hyped-up MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip (which stuttered constantly and almost crashed during 4K editing for me), this one handled everything I threw at it. With 20–30 tabs open, Teams in the browser, Zoom app running, and editing 4K video in **InShot**, it was smooth and lag-free. Exporting video was fast, and transitions, text, and clip movements were as fluid as they are on my Galaxy Tab S9+.   This chip also allows you to download all the apps from the Google Play store, something I also saw on the Lenovo, but to me I get better performance on this one.\n\nEven with only 8GB of RAM, it didn’t break a sweat. But at this price, I still think Acer should’ve put in 16GB for better future-proofing.\n\nNow, **benchmarks (JetStream and Speedometer)** only show mild improvements over my older HP x360 14c with an i3 from 2021, which is shocking. But in real-world usage, this chip feels much more powerful. Combined with the strong battery life, this is easily one of the best Chromebook chips out right now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nu5xd0z0s6qf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efa740e012bf81d7d2347cc7a25a3c92aeac6f6c\n\n**Performance: A+**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nThe screen is solid with a 16:10 aspect ratio, crisp visuals, accurate colors, and good brightness (rated at 340 nits, more than enough for outdoor use). It doesn’t quite pop like the Lenovo Chromebook Plus screen (that one I really felt like I was there watching an HDR video), but it’s plenty good for work and media.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/je6xl7k3s6qf1.jpg?width=2398&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=401798ec54a6fa5aea7f3e61b28bb62e825ec3d6\n\nThe camera, though, is excellent. It feels like using my Logitech webcam on Windows. It’s AI-enhanced, sharp in low light, and balanced in harsh light. Chromebooks used to skimp here, but this one really impressed me, even rivaling smartphone-level quality on calls.\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Acer Chromebook Plus 714 is a great machine and a clear look at where Chromebooks are headed with Intel’s Core Ultra chips. It’s sleek, powerful, has excellent battery life, and handles pretty much anything you throw at it within ChromeOS.\n\nFor most people who live in web apps (Docs, Gmail, YouTube, Office), this is exactly what you need. And honestly, people dropping $2,000 on “email machines” should be looking at ChromeOS more seriously.\n\nBut it’s not perfect. The missing fingerprint scanner, weak speakers, plastic interior, and lack of a stylus on all models really hold it back. At its original MSRP of $800, it was priced against the MacBook Air, and it’s not quite at that level yet. But at $629 (and even cheaper for open-box units at Best Buy), it’s an easy recommendation.\n\nRight now, this feels like royalty in the Chromebook lineup. Not quite the King yet, but very close. If they make the changes I mentioned, along with overall improvements due to tech available at the time, the 714 will easily be crowned King of Chromebooks. \n\n**Overall Grade: A**   \n**Excellent pickup.**",
  "I have one I bought two years ago.  One of the keys got stuck but I kind of unstuck it.  It's been good but when I tried to trade it in on this Lenovo, they told me they'd give me fifteen bucks for it so I kept it.  So now I have two chromebooks.  The Lenovo 14 Mediatek and the Acer 714 Spin",
  "You had the regular spin 714 not the plus, this model just came out in December. .but as I said about the keyboard it's not great, so I can see how it got stuck lol\n\nBest buy has the most offensive trade in numbers in the game lol",
  "mine when I bought it didnt say Plus on it but as soon as it got its update it was labeled plus.",

  "Buying a laptop and really at a loss **Background:** I previously had a Lenovo Ideapad 5 which was great until the display failed on me within 8 months. After a botched Lenovo repair and much complaining I finally got it back and then it developed another range of faults in the second year and Lenovo said it was too expensive to repair and handed me back my money. I was pretty surprised that Lenovo said the issues weren't 'economical to repair' and that put me back on the laptop market.\n\nAfter much research, I decided to give Lenovo another try. I heard the Thinkpad range was superior to the cheaper Ideapad so I waited for the latest Gen, bought a great spec T16 (32GB RAM, the best processor option for AMD, 500 nit screen) etc. The computer was expensive and honestly more than I really imagined spending but I was told it's a quality product and I had to increase my budget. I've been using the computer a few weeks and can appreciate the keyboard, display and general build quality. But the computer isn't perfect and i've noticed a few issues which make me hesitant to go down the repair route with Lenovo for a second time so early into ownership. There's a lot I like about this computer but I think the sensible choice is to return it and not touch Lenovo again given previous experience.\n\nSo i'm back in the market and really at a loss what to buy. The criteria is: windows based, 15.6 or 16 inch display, I have a 4k monitor I occasionally hook it up to and would like it to display 3840 x 2160. I'm not a gamer and my coding is not currently at a level where I need a supercomputer. A num pad would be nice. **Display:** I would like to avoid glossy displays and ideally have a 100% sRGB flicker free display. I'm also not convinced about OLED based on reliability and flicker. I just want something which isn't going to break on me within a year. Ideally <£1500.\n\n**HP Elitebook 860 G11**\n\nThis is probably the frontrunner. I use an Elitebook x360 for work. I know the build quality and keyboard is good. However, the computer can run pretty hot and become noisy. Battery life is a bit mediocre and the glossy screen sucks.\n\nI could get the Elitebook 860 G11 with a non-glossy 100%sRGB display and make sure I don't buy a Sure View panel as i've read bad things about it. The spec seems alright for my general needs. However, **are Elitebooks garbage?** HP hasn't always got the best rep and people complain. Saying that, here's me returning a 'solid' Thinkpad as i'm not convinced Lenovo is such great quality.\n\n**Dell**\n\nI hear Dell products have gone a bit downhill. The Latitude 7650 ticks some boxes but now seems pretty expensive. I could look at the cheaper Inspiron (or whatever they call their range). The XPS is pricey and i've seen some negative ownership reviews + I remember they really do run hot.\n\n**Acer / Asus / Samsung (something else)**\n\nI'm willing to consider one of these - maybe the Vivobook 16? I used to have Samsung computers which I quite enjoyed. Build quality was a bit questionable and it seems the Book range has become pricey. \n\nAppreciate any suggestions for laptops and specifically on HP! ",
  "HP consumer class is dogshit, business class is amazing.\n\nDell is shit, in both.\n\nAcer isn't great, ASUS is okay, Samsung is alright, Dynabook is okay, Fujitsu is great like really good, Gigabyte I never used so no idea.",
  "hp zbook fury  \nhp zbook firefly g11 16\"\n\nno numpads:  \ndell xps 9520 or dell precision 5560  \nhp zbook studio  \ndell precision 5680  \nasus zenbook s 16",
  "So you reckon I should be alright with the Elitebook? Is it worth paying extra to get 3 years warranty? 1 year did seem a bit stingy compared to Lenovo which chucked in 3 years. Maybe it's a waste of money but could be something useful to have? \n\nI have heard good things about Fujitsu although don't seem to be widely available online. Which makes me hesitant in case I ever need to use the warranty.",
  "Thanks for the suggestions which I will have a look into. zbook Fury (zbook range) probably a bit over my budget. Firefly is a possibility - I remember looking at it initially although thought maybe sacrifices are made to have it lighter / thinner vs something else for same price. \n\nSome of the Dell suggestions are discontinued, maybe you are suggesting used. XPS is pricey but i'll have a look around.",
  "Personally, I always void the warranty as soon as I receive the device. I have absolutely no idea if 3 years warranty is worth it to you or not.",
  "for the best allrounders, used options are the best ull get for <$1500",
  "I didn't think so until lately. If I'm spending a bunch of money on a device then maybe it makes some sense. Some people are happy with buying tech where they think of it as 'disposable' and expect to replace it within a few years. Whereas I hope to get 5+ years out of it. Still using a 12 year old Samsung!",
  "I'm sure that's the case. Just worried about buying a lemon and not having a warranty to fall back on.",
  "need help choosing school laptop hi laptop people of reddit. im having serious trouble choosing a laptop for school lol\n\nhere’s what i think you should know based on my (unsuccessful) research:\n\n- i’m finishing my associates of arts and am undecided in a major for university \n- however, it will very unlikely be in STEM as i am a humanities person looking at hospitality, film, history, sustainability, education, etc. \n- i LOVE idea of MacBook. i think the interaction with my ipad, phone, and airpods is super ideal for moving things around and adore idea of ipad as 2nd monitor\n- however, i have heard EXTREMELY mixed reviews on them for school\n- i like the power of windows and am most familiar with it but am open to learning MacOS\n- i would likely take most of my notes on my ipad and have a keyboard case for it if need be\n- portability/weight is not a concern, i already have back issues lol\n- interested in social media/video editing/photoshop\n\n\nWANTS\n- something fast\n- can run complex/multiple tasks easily\n- reliable for at least 5-6 years\n- can run smaller games like roblox/minecraft (i’m not a big gamer, but could see myself playing on steam if i was able!!)\n- something aesthetically pleasing if possible\n- decent (12hr+?) battery life :)\n\nNOPES\n- no 2-in-1. i think they’re fine but i already have an ipad so i do not need a tablet feature (touch screen ok)\n- larger than 16 in. (just inconvenient)\n- chromebooks/anything that runs like a tablet w/ play store instead of Windows/Mac\n\nIDEAL PRICE POINT IS $500-$1000\n\ni can’t go much higher than that but will try to make it work if the perfect laptop is out there\n\nso far im leaning toward MacBook but im extremely uncertain \n\nTIA for any and all help :-)\n\n\n\n",
  "If you are not doing anything engineer related then MacBook sounds like it would fit your requirements. \n\nYou might hear the MacBook is mixed for school mainly from people who are in Engineering majors that require specific programs that are only natively on windows, so you would need to use a virtual machine to run them on a MacBook which might be ok or might not be ok depending on the person.\n\nOutside of MacBook id recommend looking into thinkpads and other business grade refurbished laptops. Generally cheaper might not have as good of battery compared to MacBooks but pretty comparable and still will last a day of work, and battery will depend on the workload anyways.\n\nOh also if you buy a MacBook with an education discount I'm pretty sure you can get a pen or airpods 4 so that's nice.\n\nEdit: swapped math with engineer",

  "My Honest 1 month Macbook review Got the MacBook m4 air in midnight about a month ago, and here is my honest and unbiased review.\n\nThe battery life is phenomenal; I never have to actively think about charging ever. I just plug it in when I'm at home and toss it in a bag whenever I have to go anywhere. I've checked the battery twice, and that was when I used it to charge my phone.\n\nThe portability is amazing. I still sometimes just pick it up and admire how thin and lightweight it is, even compared to its window counterparts.\n\nThe trackpad is possibly the best one I have ever used, and I stopped carrying mice after I began using it.\n\nAs a hardcore Windows fanboy, adjusting to Mac gestures and the tabbing system took a while and is pretty unintuitive. Like, why are all my tabs just dumped on top of each other (god bless stage manager, which I was able to enjoy)\n\nMoreover, the MacBook is such a FINGERPRINT MAGNET, like I have to clean it multiple times a week\n\nThe keyboard feels weird, and I prefer a proper mechanical keyboard over Apple's one.\n\nThere are some features, like iPhone mirroring, that Android counterparts just won't work on the MacBook.\n\nOverall, I feel that this is an amazing laptop for work and other activities; however, for more heavy tasks like running many instances of code or VMs, Windows gives you a much more powerful device which can be configured exactly for what you need.",
  "*Windows gives you a much more powerful device* \n\nAre there Windows laptops that will outperform the M4 Air that also have the same battery life and the same build quality and at the same price?",

Finding a laptop that checked all my boxes was tough—IPS screen, good color accuracy, a solid keyboard, portable, and still powerful enough. I’m coming from a MacBook Pro 16-inch (amazing machine, not gonna lie), but I needed to run an app that’s Windows-only.\n\nAfter watching what felt like a million laptop reviews, my final contenders were the Yoga Slim 7i Aura and the ThinkPad X9 15. I ended up going with the Yoga Slim because of the IPS screen, and once I slapped on that matte protector, it became the perfect setup for me. Now I can work in direct sunlight without worrying about glare or reflections.\n\nThe installation, though? Absolute nightmare. I had to do it twice because the first time was full of bubbles. I even tried the classic “steamed bathroom” trick, lol. Thankfully, second time’s the charm, and now it’s flawless.\n\nImgur link for those who want to see more pictures:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/yoga-slim-7i-aura-matte-screen-protector-bnxUEsR](https://imgur.com/gallery/yoga-slim-7i-aura-matte-screen-protector-bnxUEsR)",

  "Pls help me choose laptop :3 HI guys! So im looking for laptop for only studying/ working and my girlie staff like binging netflix series at night... so it doesnt need to be super powerfull but it should be compact. I would love a device that would last me for years. I narrowed it down to these 2 options which seems to suit my needs best:\n\n1. Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Ryzen 5 7535HS/32GB/512+1TB/Win11P \n\n2. ASUS ZenBook 14 UM3406KA Ryzen AI 7 350/16GB/1TB/W11P OLED 120Hz.\n\nThey both seem to be nice and well enough for my needs as im not gaming on laptop (rather use Playstation). The price diffrence between them is not as important to me as choosing one that would be a more solid option and would last at least 5 years :3. The main diffrence between them seems to be the processor: ryzen 5 7535HS (lenovo) vs ryzen AI 7 (ASUS). Also the ASUS has OLED and I can see it is well reviewed but I'm not sure I need it as much as I am not a laptop-playing kind of girl. Also I read that there may by some technical problems with OLED such as burning in and I really cant afford service :p and thats why I am looking for something reliable and for years. \n\nI would love and appreciate any piece of advice <3 Thanksssss",
  "I would go for Asus Zenbook. It has more powerful CPU as well as OLED display - these displays usually have higher brightness and wider color gamut.",
  "I really don’t like my Zenbook, I would recommend a 100-200€ eBay lenovo or the like and a pack of cute stickers to put on it, it’s cheaper, the keyboards feel better, and they’re very unlikely to break or have issues. Modern luxury laptops are usually unrepairable, unreasonably expensive, and have bad performance compared to super loud and hot gaming laptops of the same price. If all you’re looking to do is watch movies you could buy 10 eBay laptops to do it on for the price of one modern expensive one.",

  "A brief review of the HP OmniBook X Flip 14 2-in-1 with AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 This is a very brief review of the HP OmniBook X Flip 14 2-in-1 with AMD Ryzen AI 5 340. I don't have the interest to do a full review, and there's plenty of big reviews already out there, so here's the quick version.\n\nHere we go.\n\nI got this laptop for $350 as a Best Buy Open-box return. That was a great deal. I don't think I would pay more than $550 for this laptop but it looks like it's mostly listed between $600-$700 right now.\n\nIt's a lower-mid range laptop that isn't terrible. It would be great for school, work, or if you just can't afford anything better.\n\nThis is a Model 14-FK0013DX, SKU 6613861, UPC 198990145419, BSIN JJGQJRKGHK, Product ID B5UJ0UA#ABA, Product # AK5G4AV_1.\n\nhttps://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-omnibook-x-flip-14-inch-2-in-1-laptop-next-gen-ai-pc-pdk-ak5g4av\n\nThe AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 CPU is a pretty great value. It's performance is better than expected with 6 cores and 12 threads, but it's GPU is a little below average. I'm sure you can play some games, but this isn't a gaming laptop. Unfortunately, the higher CPU performance seems to come at the expense of battery life, but that's not a terrible tradeoff to make. Get a battery bank.\n\nThe 512GB NVME drive in mine is a full size 2280 WD SN500, but you could end up with a Samsung or something else.\n\nThe screen is average. You get what you pay for here and I can't complain for the price. It's a little grainier than I would like, the colors are okay but not great, and the brightness is okay but not great, but it's a good value panel.\n\nThe body is very nice. It has a good look and better-than-expected feel. It is a little heavier than expected.\n\nI am a Linux user, so I don't even bother mentioning any potential Windows issues. You should always do a full reinstall anyway to wipe out all of the crappy OEM bloatware.\n\nAlmost everything worked perfectly in the Linux distros I've tested. Be sure to use something recent. The touchpad, keyboard, and Wifi won't work well without a recent kernel. The one thing that wasn't working was fan sensor reporting, but other thermal information seemed to be correct.\n\nPhoronix has a review of a similar laptop if you want benchmarks. I imagine the results should be very similar\n\nhttps://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen-ai-5-340\n\nhttps://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-krackan-point-windows-linux\n\nIf you want to boot linux, go into the UEFI and enable Boot Options > Enable MS UEFI CA key and disable Secure Boot.\n\n\"Word of warning - disabling Pluton can break suspend/resume\"\n\nThe ports are fine. There's no Thunderbolt, but you get a USB4 port. I wish there was a USB-C port on each side for charging from the right.\n\nFlipping the lid open could be easier. There's nowhere to catch your finger onto to pry it apart.\n\nThe touchpad is a good size and clicks great. The surface is a little rough and it's plastic instead of glass, but it works.\n\n[The one thing I will complain about is the keyboard. I hate it. If you are a touch typist just get something else. If you are slow and don't care, then it's fine.](https://old.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1mytqff/the_hp_omnibook_x_flip_14_14fk0013dx_keyboard_is/)\n\nThe power button is on the keyboard, displacing the DEL key. I hate that too.\n\n~~And finally, the FN key has an LED light that never goes out. It's bugged. There's even a thread about it on the HP support site. You can't turn it off. What's the point other than wasting power and being annoying? Nothing.~~ UPDATE: I was wrong about the annoying FN key LED. It turns off as long as you have it set to \"Auto\" in the UEFI. However, the meaning of \"Auto\" is very unintuitive. It's definitely annoying when it's on though, and there's a reason why almost every other manufacture keeps the two keys needed to turn it on far away from each other.\n\nOver all, this is a pretty good lower-mid-range convertable laptop with a terrible keyboard. If you care about the keyboard, don't get it, or any other laptop with a latticeless keyboard. If you don't care about the keyboard, wait for a sale in the $450-$550 range.",
  "Honestly, the only real downside I noticed with the HP Omnibook X is the display. It’s fine for day-to-day stuff, but it’s not super bright and kinda struggles outdoors. Also, no OLED option so if you care about deep blacks or really punchy colors, this might feel a bit underwhelming compared to other laptops in the same price range. For a machine that nails battery life and performance, the screen feels like the one corner they cut. IDK why! these snapdragon powered devices doesn't work well!",
  "The colors are terrible. The red is orange. I put my color tuned display next to this laptop and the red is totally ORANGE. It's not even close to red.\n\nThe green is a little yellowy and the blue is kind of cyan.\n\nIt works for work but I wouldn't want to use this thing for personal stuff like pictures and watching videos.",
  "Budget PC Laptop for Light-ish Gaming Hi everyone!\n\nSo, I’m a Mac girl at heart and have a MacBook Pro as well as the new M4 Mac Mini. But I quickly realized that I’d need a PC if I wanted to play some of the best cozy games. SO, I bought a pretty powerful desktop PC that I use in my office to play and stream. It’s been great!\n\nHowever, I have a few invisible illnesses so there are many days when I just want to play games on my couch (and watch TV, too). I have a Switch, but that’s not what I need—handhelds aren’t what I’m looking for here. I’d love to snag a PC laptop so that I can melt into the couch while playing my games on Steam (Palia, Coral Island, etc.).\n\nNow that I have my awesome gaming PC, I’m having a hard time shifting my brain from the specs I wanted for that. I won’t be streaming from this laptop and it’ll purely be used for some cozy games. Do any of you have recommendations on a laptop that will suit these needs without breaking the bank (under $600)? I think I’ll need at least 16GB of RAM and although I’d love 1T of storage, I’m absolutely ok not having this…especially if the SSD is upgradable. Graphics cards (or integrated, most likely) are the main issue here. I’ve seen a few non-name brands on Amazon (NIMO) that have pretty decent reviews.

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",

So, would like to have some reviews about it\n",
  "NEVER buy asus laptops they are masters in pc motherboards but recently asus is horrible in laptops and their drivers and everything. for you or generally speaking Lenovo should always be your first option because it is with no doubt the best preformance per value in the market or you could also get a HP which are great but i favor Lenovo. and the ideapad slim 5 is THE BEST option, it has the best build quality and also does not break the bank.",
  "Hard time choosing a new laptop. So I currently am using a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, and am planning on upgrading because: A) It is not powerful enough, and B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nI am a student and will primarily be using the laptop for school work, so it needs to be portable and a comfortable weight to bring with me to and from class. I love how portable my 13\" Air is. I've done a LOT of research over the past two years, but never bit the bullet, but I feel like now is the time, and so I've committed to buying one now.\n\nMy use cases (in order of importance): School, Music Production, Photoshop, Gaming\n\nI don't play a lot of games but it would be nice to have a machine to play some Civ 6 or even some other, more intensive games like BO2/BO3 Zombies (and MAYBEEEE some RDR2) when I am on a plane for a long time. I want something that's decent on battery life, I don't spend all day at school, maybe 4 hours at most on a given day, so I want something that'll last me that long doing just school work without having to even worry about bringing a charger.\n\nNow, I've looked at like tens of laptops, from gaming to notebook, and I've seen some I've considered like the Zenbook S16, Lenovo Slim 7i Aura, Zenbook 14, Zenbook A14, but I've narrowed it down to a couple:\n\nZephyrus G14/G16 - The clear winner for me, problem is it is just too expensive, and the only models that go on sale into my price range are the 4050 G14 and 4060 G16 models which I've heard may not be worth it. They don't go on sale super often, and the ones that do are open box. (Currently can get the 4050 model for $1499 CAD open box)\n\nZenbook Duo 2024 (Ultra 9, 32GB, 1TB, 60hz 1080p model) - I've toyed with the idea of having this laptop for a while. My PC setup at home has 3 monitors and I absolutely love it, and could see myself getting genuine use out of both screens when writing an assignment, key word being WHEN I am doing an assignment, which isn't an every day thing. I don't think it would be powerful enough to handle any gaming at all. Surprisingly, this is actually cheaper than both the G14 and G16 Models I would be getting. (Currently can get it Refurb-Excellent for $1519 CAD)\n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 15\" - This just came out, and I feel like 15\" is the perfect size for me to be honest. I can get the spec with the Ryzen 7 260, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD (will add another in the future), and a 5060 8GB card for within my price range, around $1750 all in. It's around 4 pounds which is the heaviest of the three, but is also the fastest of the three. It's so new that there isn't a single review yet for it. (Brand new for $1750 CAD, could try and haggle it at Lenovo)\n\nThese are my three ideas right now in terms of what to get. Does anyone have any recommendations? Anyone with these laptops have advice?\n\nI'd not like to spend more than $2000 CAD.\n\nEDIT: In case it wasn't clear, this is not meant to be a desktop replacement; I already have one.",
  "Well you need to be aware of the fact that most gaming laptops have a dedicated gpu they are loud heavy and the battery life is 3hours at best and the performance is ass when on battery .\nSo you’ll want something with a powerful igpu like a Ryzen ai 300 series (the Ryzen 7 or 9 models) or the intel core ultra 200 series ( like the ultra 7 258v) these have the most powerful iGPUs currently available. Also their batter life is pretty good.",
  "Don't buy the Zenbook duo. It's more of a gimmick and not a good choice for your use case. \n\nGaming laptops all suffer from battery life. They always need to be plugged in. They don't last long. \n\nYou might want to get something with a modern AMD Ryzen 8000 series CPU. The integrated graphics are good for some light gaming. These CPU are also power efficient so you get good battery life.\n\nAsus Zenbook S16 and Zenbook 14 should be the models to consider. The models with AMD Ryzen CPUs.",
  ">B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nGood luck.",
  "Thanks!",
  "wdym? ive been using windows for my entire life and got a macbook on a whim in 2020 and i can say with certainty that windows is much better (at least for me)",

While this isn't a comprehensive review, I hope it might be helpful to some.\n\n* **Processor:** Intel Core Ultra 7 258V 4 x 2.2 - 4.8 GHz, 37 W PL2 / Short Burst, 17 W PL1 / Sustained, Lunar Lake\n* **Graphics adapter**: Intel Arc Graphics 140V\n* **Memory**: 32 GB, LPDDR5x-8533, Dual-Channel\n* **Display**: 14 inches 16:10, 2880 x 1800 pixel 243 PPI, ATNA40CU09-0, OLED, glossy, HDR, 120 Hz\n* **Weight**: 1.179 kg\n\nThe build quality is impressive. The device looks sleek, super thin, and relatively light.\n\nThe display is excellent, though as someone who's seen and owned many OLEDs, I wish it were matte like the new Tab S10. Nonetheless, it's a really good screen. The touchscreen is a nice addition, but in my opinion, it would be better if the display could be laid flat. Everything runs smoothly at 120Hz, and it supports VRR.\n\nThe trackpad is one of the best mechanical ones I've used. While it doesn't compare to haptic trackpads, it's still very good.\n\nThe speakers are surprisingly good for a laptop this size. They caught me off guard with their quality.\n\nThe keyboard is decent, though I wish the keys had more travel. That's what happens when you've tried a ThinkPad keyboard – everything else falls short.\n\nI didn't buy it for gaming, but I tested Fortnite, and it played well. I also experimented with XeSS, which provided a good experience. But I'm not really a gamer, I play light games like Vampire Survivors, AoEIIHD, Mini Motorways, etc.\n\nOverall performance is okay, but not as snappy as Snapdragon-powered laptops. The multicore performance, in my opinion, is almost ridiculously low. Compared to an iPad M4, X Elite / X Plus, or M3 MacBook, it feels like it's lacking some power. This is hard to describe, and I'm used to high-end devices (my workstation has a 7950x, I have an M3 MBP from work, I've had a P14s with an 8840hs, etc), so maybe I'm just too demanding. However, my overall feeling is that it can easily become sluggish.\n\nIt's also quite loud, which is my biggest disappointment. I thought it'd be silent for web browsing and such. While typing this with only Obsidian and Edge open, the fan is spinning. The CPU temperature is around 45-50°C, drawing about 5W. I'm on \"Best Performance\" mode since the laptop is plugged in, but for less than 5W of CPU power, the fan activity seems excessive. Perhaps the chassis isn't great at dissipating heat. It's annoying, especially when any ARM device would be completely silent under these conditions.\n\nThe laptop wakes up almost instantly from sleep, but not quite as fast as ARM devices. Battery life seems better than typical Intel laptops, likely due to Intel's architecture optimization and fewer cores (and low performance). However, based on my brief testing, I don't think it'll match the battery life of X Elite / X Plus devices (SP11, Slim 7x, PZ13). The battery drained about 4% in 10.5 hours, which seems high compared to my PZ13, which only drained 1% in the same period.\n\nMy conclusion: If you need to use an x86-only app that doesn't emulate well, play games that don't run on ARM, want good battery life without needing much power, or don't believe in ARM's future in the PC world, this might work for you. The device is great. Lunar Lake is... a mixed experience. Otherwise, I'd recommend sticking with ARM. I think x86 in thin and light devices may be approaching its end.",
  "I thought battery life on lunar lake vs arm chips were relatively the same? And if not better than the snapdragon chips?",
  "One month update: \n\nThis is the best x86 portable device I've owned by far. It is mostly quiet when on Balanced or Power Saving. I was initially worried about the noise, but I guess \"Best performance mode\" was overkill anyway to browser the web, so my bad :) Again, not as snappy as ARM, but as good as it gets with x86 for a thin & light laptop. Battery life has been nothing short of amazing for my casual use. The overall package is really good on this device. Only con is that it's pretty expensive, but at least it comes with 32GB/1TB, not 16GB/512GB like the M4 MBP at the same price (but M4 should perform much MUCH better, and last much longer, but no OLED, no touchscreen, no upgradable storage, no WiFi7, etc).",
  "Want to buy a zenbook 15, doesnt asus have a setting that you can make the fan run slower ? doesnt that help with fan sound?",
  "Thanks for your review! I've been holding out as long as possible to replace my 2016 windows laptop. Wanted to see how lunar lake did in comparison to snapdragon. Kind of disappointed to hear that that its noticeably less powerful. I talked to a guy at microcenter who said they were getting a lot of returns on the ARM laptops because of the incompatibility.",
  "thanks for the review!   \namazed to understand it feels less snappy than the ARM variants.   \nalso i understand there is a serious performance drop while on battery?\n\ni think they should have put this weak cpu in extreme ultra portables like the surface or very thin and light devices. seems its not a buff enough for more than that?",
  "Hi OP, how about the wireless (wifi and BT) connections reliability ? \n\nI mean, i read that some user of ryzen ai based zenbook have issues with wireless connections reliability (probably because of mediatec chip ?).\n\nI'm still considering to get zenbook lunar lake or ryzen ai, still researching now",
  "So how is the screen outdoors ive heard people call it a black mirror is that true?",
  "could you let me know if this laptop charges above 65 watts? the charger it comes with is 65 but i’m curious if more works.",
  "Snapdragons are snappy until they aren’t compatible with native programs, then snapdragon becomes slow, clunky, and frozen. There are simply too many things still using non native arm for a snapdragon to truely replace a traditional laptop. At least for me. It makes me sad 😢",
  "When you talk about snappiness do you mean ARM is generally better than x86 or just better than 258v? Also which ARM CPUs are we talking in comparison to? Apple or Snapdragon chips?",
  "Thanks for the update. Thinking of getting one - does it get warm (at the bottom of the chassis) when on Balanced/Whisper mode? And how is the battery life comparing to the M3 MBP (I have the M1 MBP, hence the question)",
  "Yeah, that's right, there's a whisper mode. Right now I'm unplugged, the whole thing is draining \\~4w-5w, the CPU drains 1w-2w, CPU temp is 38. That's pretty good for sure, but it's also even more limited in performance in this mode. For $2500 CAD, that's a lot to ask for such limited performance.",
  "I'm also looking to upgrade (from a 2011 Gateway laptop), and as of right now it seems like Macbooks are the way to go if you don't care about Windows or gaming, Lunar Lake for thin and light general use (still waiting for more devices), and AMD for heavier use.\n\nThe reality is that Windows on ARM is just not 100% there yet. If it runs the software you need, it works great. But if it doesn't, it's basically useless. That's why you get OP singing praises about Snapdragon laptops and how x86 is dying, and the Microcenter guy saying people are returning them.\n\nAs an example, Snapdragon laptops can't even run Ableton Live in emulation mode, so it's a no-go for me. I really don't want to bother looking up the compatibility for all my software (and even if it runs in emulation, there's going to be a performance or battery penalty).",
  "No performance drop on battery AFAIK",
  "Zero issue with Wifi and BT",
  "It's glossy but it's as good or as bad as any other laptop IMO 🤷🏻",
  "65 max. The battery isn't that big tbh and 65 is more than enough for quick top-ups",
  ">When you talk about snappiness do you mean ARM is generally better than x86 or just better than 258v?\n\nThat X Plus / X Elite are snappier than X86. 258V is close, but ARM is still snappier. It adds up after hours of small really quick interactions.\n\n>Also which ARM CPUs are we talking in comparison to? Apple or Snapdragon chips?\n\nSpecifically, Snapdragon since we're talking PCs. But ARM in generally snappier since the instructions are less complex (thus require less time to execute).",
  "we're you able to get one with an English keyboard?",
  "💯\n\nWindows on ARM is great until your good patience is reached, eg: I can't print double sided on my brother printer, why? No drivers for ASIO, and I know focusrite will take forever to release their, if they ever do. It piles up really quickly, and these devices aren't cheap. So it's a matter of what you're willing to compromise the most... battery life? performances? compatibility? price?\n\nBattery life: ARM or Intel\nPerformances: AMD or ARM\nCompatibility: AMD or Intel\nPrice: previous gen AMD/Intel\n\nLunar Lake is a good balance, but it still lacks what ARM offers on battery life, perf per watt and features like instant wake up/no battery drain on sleep. But it runs everything, just a bit slower at time.\n\nIt's not easy 😅\n\nAnd then you have MacBooks that just do it all. 🙃 Okay except gaming but I personally don't care about it so",
  "I am also planning to replace my current laptop but currently holding it out as long as the current one works because I am confused whether to go with arm, lunar lake or macbook air. \n\nHopefully within next one year, it will be clear, but I am more and more leaning towards MBA",
  "Thanks...now i'm choosing between asus or lenovo",
  "I would really appreciate if you could send me afew pics showcasing the glare on the screen 🙏",
  "Any issues with outside use? Is it completely unusable or just worst?",
  "Thanks for the info. Looks like Lunar chips are good if you want to go with compatibility and somewhat improvement on power efficiency but not as optimized as snapdragon chips with that gives more snappy experience. AMD strix on the other hand consume more power and would probably need a big chassis to keep things cool.",
  "Yes only the labels are bilingual [https://i.imgur.com/vKb4n3B.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/vKb4n3B.jpeg)",
  "Purchased yoga x elite three weeks ago. I opted for snapdragon over macbook bc better repair-ability. I see a lot of people over-look this point when they compare windows vs apple. Screen replacement on windows costs \\~120USD and is possible to DIY. whereas screen replacement of a macbook air 15'' screen costs around \\~$600USD and can only be replaced by apple first party shop and takes days.",
  "Hello mate. Do you use this laptop for music production ? Runs smoothly ? Thx a lot",
  "I think it's a good idea to wait if possible because the M4 MBA should be coming early 2025, and more Lunar Lake laptops should be coming as well. But if you don't need Windows for specific software or games, then I would honestly just go MBA",
  "yes, even though I have been a windows user all through my life but plan to shift on mac because of the build quality and the long battery life it provides, I may take M2 MBA as now 16gb has become minimum and after the release of M4 MBA, the prices of M2 MBA will go down a bit hopefully.",
  "Buying laptop under 50k  Anyone here knows or have some review about the laptop lenovo thinkbook 16 ryzen 5 7535HS\nHere is the link\nhttps://amzn.in/d/7ZI3J0x \nPls share your reviews.....",
  "MacBook Air m4 256gb as a CS major ? I was thinking to buy the new MacBook Air m4 for college . I’ve seen some reviews saying that it can’t run old languages or something .\n\nAs a CS major would it actually be a good choice to get it ?. Idk if it’s suitable for the classes I’m going to take or not .\n\nIf there’s any other suggestions just put them below 🙏",
  "For the most part binaries compiled for older Intel Macs will run through Apple's Rosetta compatibility layer, so they'll still run on M-chip Macs. Compatibility issues arent that common, and a VM is always an option if you need Windows specific programs - I'd say that it's a great choice",
  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget €2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years. As longevity is important, I believe performance is an important criteria. My current setup is an 8th gen Intel i5 Asus laptop (8/256) and a M4 Mac Mini (24/512) on the desk. I want to replace both of these items with a single Windows laptop and I'll sell the Mac. I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around €2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. €1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. €1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. €1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. €2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. €2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** €2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",
  "Have you ruled out Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024 or 2025)? It is a cheaper Asus ProArt with the same of internals.  These Asus model carry the best speakers of all Windows laptops which is nice to have if you have kids or others to share a screen.",
  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",
  "Question: why are you listing high refresh rate laptops? Is that something you want?\n\nBecause I doubt you’ll max out that refresh rate in games unless you play older games or competitive online games.\n\nEdit: nvm just saw you don’t care about games.",
  "Have you considered a HP ZBook?",
  "T14 Thinkpads",
  "Update: Added the Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) to the list",
  "I did but seems a little difficult to find them not overly priced in Ireland.",
  "I'm doing some research on the P14s this morning.\n\nDirect from Lenovo I can get the Ultra 9 185H, no operating system, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 3K IPS display for €2370.\n\nA local retailer has the Ultra 9 185H, Win 11 Pro, 32GB RAM, 1TB performance SSD, 2560x1600 @ 90Hz display for €1790.\n\nI don't think the better display is worth €600.",
  "Also, unlike the ProArt you don't need to pay for a 4070 you said you wouldn't be using much. The 16:10 screen is also good for web development with it's bit of extra height. P1's are also pretty much the top of the Thinkpad scale, being workstation laptops and thus very solid. P1 gen 7 is also 17mm thick and 2kg so pretty portable.",
  "You're right, I never game but do appreciate a nice smooth screen. High refresh rate is not a must have but more a nice to have.",
  "I will take a look, thanks",
  "Thanks. A lot of praise online for Thinkpads",
  "Lenovo Thinkbook 14 Is it worth it for (1) Adobe Apps, (2) Video Editing, (3) Light gaming like roblox? "
