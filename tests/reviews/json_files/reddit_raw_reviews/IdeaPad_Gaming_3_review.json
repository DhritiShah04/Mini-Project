  "Lenovo Ideapad slim 3 gen 10 AMD 14\" So i bought this laptop for £469 in the UK for university and i have had it for about a week now and I have not seen any reviews so i thought i would leave a review. It has a ryzen 5 8640hs with integrated radeon graphics, 16gb ram dual channel and a 60wh battery\n\nBuild quality: This laptop is made of sturdy plastic, the finish feels very nice but it is nothing to boast about, it is good enough for the price. I like how it is very lightweight and is really easy to carry around.\n\nDisplay: The anti-glare coating is great for this and really helps when it is sunny outside and the sun is very bright. 1920x1200 is very sharp but other than that its a regular 60hz IPS panel but it definitely gets the job done.\n\nKeyboard: This one does not come with a full size keyboard but I am not too bothered by this personally as I dont usually use the rest of the other keys. Sometimes I do press the wrong keys but once you get used to it, its a solid keyboard.\n\nPerformance: The CPU in this is very fast, whatever I do happens in an instant whether im video editing, watching videos, playing games or in a meeting. The 16gb ram also plays a huge role in this. What surprised me the most was the performance of the GPU considering its only 15W. I dont play very heavy games but this GPU was able to run forza horizon 4, fortnite, GTA, battlefield 1 and hollow Knight at good fps(these are the games I usually play). I also did some wii u emulation and it was flawless. One thing I will mention is that the laptop can be quite noisy when gaming on extreme performance mode but is very quiet when not being pushed.\n\nBattery: The battery on this is great for what it is. I was able to achieve around 7-8 hours from 100 percent to 20 whilst just doing my assignments(on battery saver). I got around 5-6 hours on netflix. When gaming the max i got was around 3 hours of battery life which is not too bad.",
  "wow thanks for this review! I was thinking of getting this laptops but couldn't find a lot of reviews so thanks <3",
  "Nice review, I just bought the version with AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS with dual RAM of 8 GB each. I hope I don't regret it, but the price of €630 seemed very advantageous to me honestly",
  "How good an idea is it to get this same version but with 24GB of RAM for $800? Considering that I live in Chile and our prices tend to be higher than those in first-world countries.",
  "Hi! Thanks for the review. Do you think it's worth getting the Ryzen 78840HS version for 40€ more?? I'm gonna be using it for university work. Music production software and other music related software and some gaming",
  "Hi, I am interested of this Laptop, i.e. the 8840HS variant, supports DP alt mode 1.4 on the USB-C port.",
  "I know it's an old post but how is the laptop holding up so far ?",
  "Hi I’ve had this laptop for over a month now and it’s been pretty good thus far but have a few issues/concerns and wanted to see if others are having! 1. The trackpad is not good my fingers dont move on it well and it doesn’t feel sturdy it feels pretty cheap. 2. I might of banged it at some stage but I noticed with the display when it shows black things the pixels are blue in a certain spot only a little you can barely notice it but it bothers me.",
  "No problem its a great laptop for its price, still going strong right now",
  "How is the battery?",
  "As far as I'm aware the \"24GB\" version doesn't exist, it can just support up to 24GB, as in you need to buy extra memory and install it yourself. If that's 800USD that's a disgusting price. Are Apple products also more expensive there? Personally I'd be looking into an Air M4 for that price.",
  "Dont get it, its not worth it at that price point",
  "Absolutely, that ryzen 7 is quite a bit faster and will be better for running multiple tasks, the igpu on it is slightly faster than the ryzen 5 one by about 10%. For €40 more yeah i would say its worth it",
  "Cant really say but its most likely similar to this one but with a stronger gpu and cpu",
  "Its holding up great the battery and performance is still good",
  "In reality it has yet to arrive, they're taking a long time to ship and maybe I'm changing my mind, opting for a thinkpad for €100 more though",
  "Hi, this I assume. Does your model support DP Alt Mode 1.4?",
  "I can buy the slim 3, witht he ryzen 7 only 16gb ram and 60Wh battery for £466, worth ?",
  "ciao, potresti fare un aggiornamento? quale PC hai preso alla fine? a che thinkpad stavi pensando? ti trovi bene?",
  "Whats that",
  "Yeah thats worth it",
  "This is the standard describing how video signals are sent over the USB-C port. ",
  "Planning to buy a lenovo ideapad 3 slim ryzen 7 5000 series, laptop Thoughts in this? \n\nFull specs in the pic\n\nSomehow I can't find any reviews on this specific model. I think it's because it's in my region/country only(?). \n\nTo clarify, my purpose of buying this is for light gaming, studies, programming, & multitasking. I'm fine with ram being soldered. Will use this 4 years minimum. \n\nIn general, can anyone who uses/used lenovo ideapad 3 (any models, or this in particular) share their experience and if there are any issues? any reviews or feedbacks? 🙏\n\nQuestions:\n- Can this last for 4 years? \n- How many hours does battery last based on ur experience? \n- Any heating issues? Is it recommended to buy a cooling pad right away? \n- Can it handle minor damages?\n\nOr if you better recommendations pls feel free to do so. Though, don't recommend me thinkpads, i know it's good, but i have a budget and need cheaper like this. Thank you 🙏\n\n\n\n",

  "+ Does the audio sounds good and loud enough? ",
  "pls be honest if u did anything that made ur laptop had issues (like overheating it for a long period, opening sites that has malware, accidentally dropping a heavy object on the laptop, and such) 🙏 , im very careful with my devices so if it's the kind of laptop that just malfunction/become faulty all of a sudden, pls let me knoww tysm",
  "Based on 47Whr battery, it will last you prob 5hrs at best when you do a battery saver setting.\n\n\nBut that's what should have been with budget laptop.\n\n\nIf by light gaming you mean games that can be played with iGPU, then it's no problem.\n\n\nAbout heating issues, as long as the fan is working, it won't be a problem. Cooling pad is recommended tho.\n\n\nCan this last 4 years , depends on how you use it. And probably the first problem that you will have within 4 years is not enough storage.",
  "Wdym by that? Is 16/512 combo not enough for a non working professional student?",
  "system already takes 44GB, and the storage won't be 512 , probably less when you have the laptop.\n\nso, imagine you install games that take at least 20GB , and then some videos and photos, overtime it will be filled.\n\nmine already have less than 700GB already from total 950GB in 6 months.",

  "Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15ACH6 – A review and upgrade path First, I’ll tell you about myself. Mainly because it could help you decide on getting the same or a similar laptop if you have similar needs to me. I’m a mechanical engineering student. Currently, I use CAD somewhat frequently for college and \\*very\\* frequently for personal use, so a dedicated GPU was pretty much necessary. A decently Good CPU was also needed for simulation work and \\*very\\* amateurish programming. Video and image editing are also hobbies of mine, but I don’t do anything extravagant so they weren’t really a deciding factor. I also love to be dramatic and firmly believe I am a professional writer. I’m not, so if you don’t like that kind of writing, I’ll leave a TL;DR at the end of this post.\n\nSo, the laptop. The IdeaPad 3 Gaming I bought comes with a wired RGB mouse I will probably not use (it’s still in its sealed bag), some very disappointing manuals and guides (I just downloaded the actual ones from Lenovo’s site) and a 135W AC charger. Internally, it has a Ryzen 5 5600H, a single 8 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM RAM clocked at 3200 MHz, one 512 GB M.2 Samsung NVMe Gen3x4 SSD (model is MZ-ALQ512B), a Nvidia RTX 3050 4GB and finally a 15.6” 1080p 120 Hz display.\n\nI actually wanted to do this just because of this next section: Upgrades. I’ve always been a sucker for high-capacity drives, so the tiny 512 GB of space made me feel uneasy every single time I thought about my locally stored movies, TV shows, comics, games… Point is: I wanted to upgrade. Problem was: I read online that only the 2242 M.2 slot (the one with the stock SSD) could reach Gen4 speeds.\n\nI’ve also read only that this thing would NOT work with a higher than 512 GB drive on the 2242 slot. I just ignored that and got a 2 TB Crucial P310 Gen4 drive. FUCK. YEAH.\n\nI found it on Micro Center for sale at $149.99 USD too. This is important because my third-world mind was already going crazy inside that celestial store. I felt like I was dreaming in that GPU aisle. The custom keyboards too???? I loved every single plack-time I spent in there. My dad (we were on a business trip btw) was searching for a USB to VGA cable and they had it. WHAT. Who even needs that? Truly, an ascending and heavenly experience.\n\nAnyways. I was very worried it wouldn’t work. I already have a fully functional 2 TB NVMe and a 1 TB SATA drive on my PC, so if this didn’t work I just wasted half my salary in something I would 100% not be able to sell at that same price. Not to mention, I still needed an adapter. This thing is 2230, and if you remember correctly, the slot only fits 2242 drives. So…\n\nI’ll go over how good it performs now:\n\n* Gaming\n\nIn the very few games I tested, it was a very good experience. I mostly play only old games, so this might not mean much to you, but Bayonetta, Sonic X Shadow Generations and Rocket League ran perfectly fine. In Bayonetta’s case, it ran even better than on my desktop -$1200- gaming PC, which honestly doesn’t mean much since it barely counts as running in that system.\n\n* CAD\n\nThe most important thing to me. It runs flawlessly. And now, we go back to the Crucial drive! I designed the adapters using Inventor 2025 on the base laptop (as in “stock configuration”). The only problem I could name is that, for some reason, it takes Inventor like a whole minute to load the first project. Be it a fully finished model or just a blank file. It’s very weird.\n\nAfter finishing the model and getting it printed, I was ready to see if my dumb ass would be enjoying two whole terabytes of data on his new laptop.\n\n \n\nIt. Worked.\n\n \n\nI was so stupidly happy. And you know what? I haven’t mentioned that I also installed two 16 GB 3200 MHz sticks. EVERYTHING WORKED WITH NO ISSUES. It felt amazing. The trip to Micro Center, the fact that I was actually upgrading a laptop, the excitement I felt going into the Amazon Locker to retrieve my shiny new 32 gigs of RAM… Truly a wonderful experience.\n\nAfter I installed Windows I decided to check both drive’s speeds, just to be sure. Another big discovery for us; 15ACH6 owners. Turns out that if you only have ONE M.2 drive installed, the drive will run at full Gen3x4 speeds. The damn manual says it runs at Gen3x2, but that is almost a complete lie. Thing is, if you install TWO NVMe drives, the speeds get halved, effectively functioning as two Gen3x2 slots. I’ll add the CrystalDiskMark results as pictures if you want to check them.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI’m really enjoying this laptop. It’s a very capable device. I can confirm that it supports up to 32 GB and a 2 TB NVMe drive and would recommend having just one of those installed to maximize speeds.",

  "Can someone please send me the vbios of this laptop using gpuz",
  "That is an amazingly short review, with incredible lack of details.  :D",
  "I know it's been like 10 days but if you still need a review, here we go.\n\nI bought this laptop around October last year, absolutely beautiful machine. True that RTX2050 will be sort of a bottleneck because it's an entry level RTX. But that doesn't mean it's slow or too outdated. Last laptop I had just had an integrated Intel 520, so good enough upgrade for me.\nNo AAA games on max settings but it goes good enough with medium settings.\n\nHere's general FPS for the games I've played:\n- Cyberpunk (Medium High no ray tracing) - 50/60\n- Spiderman Remastered (High with ray tracing) - 60-90\n- Miles Morales (Medium with ray tracing) - 60-80\n- War Thunder (Movie - highest settings) - 90-110\n- Forza Motorsport 7 (Ultra) - 80\n- Assassin's Creed: Syndicate (High) - 60-100\n\nAMD CPU is amazing, it's powerful but power efficient. I have a dual channel 8GB×2 = 16gb RAM so it keeps the performance good and steady. It's pretty much future proof for me as well because 7000s are 2023 make and HS models mean power efficient performance processors. I plan on some fun pc gaming so it's not like I want a 400FPS gameplay on some heavy 4k graphics. For a student, it's a pretty good budget friendly gaming laptop.\n\nBattery life goes around 4 hours. It's not much but it's good enough for a gaming laptop. Of course you can turn off Nvidia graphic card when not plugged in and switch to 60Hz for better battery, but it's not MacBook Air. Fans would feel loud if you are playing a graphics intensive game in a very quiet environment(like calm winter night) but they keep this baby at good temperature. I've seen it go 65°C max but that's all good good.\n\n\nAll that being said, it's a budget friendly gaming laptop. You can't compare it with high end Legion Pros or Omen laptops. But for this cost, I'll choose it again. Unless I get that Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming Ryzen 5 6600H+3050 for ₹51k again, but that deal just never came around once I missed it.\n\nAnyway, absolutely love this beast, it's beautiful and quite professional looking for a gaming laptop.\nToo bad I can't insert a picture here.",

  "I code, watch movies and experiment with blender at times. I'd say it's a good laptop for designing and research, but RTX2050 is a little old for anything too new. Unreal Engine 5 wouldn't run too smooth or fast but it will work if you don't mind cutting down cost for a couple more seconds of rendering.\nThat being said, Ryzen inside is pretty much future proof for a couple years so the laptop would be good to go for anything CPU hungry, and dual channel 16gb DDR5 will make sure it does not hang up even a bit",

  "Lenovo ideapad gaming 3 vs asus tuf a15 Hey, i want to buy a laptop suit for my studying and casual gaming with a tiny budget. I have picked out two products that suit me best from other names but have difficulty choosing among these two (same specs, both are AMD) to use for at least 4 years in university. Any recommend or review about these laptop?\n - I have watch some reviews and what make me confused is the build quality and the thermal system of these two. Here is some information i have collected (not sure if its correct) \n    + Ideapad gaming 3: better thermal system, poorer build (not sure) and i have concern about the screen since the hot air is flowerd directly to it bc of the design\n     + Tuf a15: have thermal system, better build (i've heard that the tuf series had passed some military test or sth)\n  So, the questions is: is the tuf a15's thermal that bad? For me, i want a good built laptop for the next upcoming 4 years so i can sacrifice 4-5 celsius higher in my daily uses as long as the build is superior. And does the hot air flowed directly to the hinge and screen of my laptop effect the life span of my laptop?\nTL;DR: wondering about the thermal system of tuf a15, hot air flowed to the screen and the build quality of lenovo ideapad gaming 3.",

  "Just use a stand",
  "Just got a new laptop (Lenovo Ideapad 5 Ryzen 4500u) for college, and fiqured I would write a mini review for it!  \n\n**Intro/Summary -** Hey everybody, today I will be reviewing the $650 14’ Lenovo Ideapad 5, with the new AMD Ryzen 4500u processor. I recently purchased this laptop as my full-time college laptop, and have been using it extensively for about a week now. At only 3 pounds, this laptop is easily portable for those who need it. Overall, I am very pleased with this laptop’s functionality and performance, especially considering the price. However, this does not come without a few quirks that a buyer should be aware of before purchasing.\n\n**Screen -** First I want to talk about what is in my opinion the most important part of a laptop for the average user: the screen. In budget laptops, manufacturers often cut corners in this regard, making cheap, low resolution, dim panels. Unlike that however, the $650 model that I purchased comes with a FHD 1920x1080p IPS panel with 300 nits of brightness. The IPS panel will be a blessing for anyone who has not had one before, as it has amazing view angles and little to no glare. While it’s 300 nits brightness is nothing to write home about, it is respectable. The color accuracy is where this screen lacks, at around 55% srgb color accuracy. This means that video editors and graphic designers should look elsewhere, but the average user/gamer should be fine. I will warn you though that it has a noticeable amount of backlight bleed, which may be a big turnoff for some people. However, it is nowhere near debilitating, and is easily overlooked considering the other positives behind this screen.\n\n**Keyboard/Touchpad -** While I do not consider myself very picky towards keyboards in general, in consideration with other reviews and comments made on this laptop, the keyboard is very good. In fact, some very reputable reviewers like Just Josh even said it is the best keyboard they own, up against $1400 laptops! It has a nice clicky feel and sound to it, almost like a mini mechanical keyboard. The layout is great, however if you like a dedicated numpad, you will have to get the 15’ model, as the 14’ model does not have it, as it saves space. The touchpad is hit or miss in my opinion, as I will always prefer to use a mouse over any touchpad. However, if you plan to use the touchpad primarily, it should do the job just fine, and be accurate with its’ Windows precision drivers.\n\n**Ports/Features -** When it comes to ports, this laptop has exactly what you should expect from a laptop of this size and price. 2x USB, USB C charging, HDMI, SD card reader, and a Headphone/Mic aux combo port. I would have liked to see a third USB, but if you need more you can always get a USB hub for your desk or on the go. The laptop also comes with a physical webcam switch for privacy, Fingerprint reader on the power button, Screen lip for ease of opening (yes you can open this laptop with one hand), and dual front facing speakers that aren’t anything special, but get the job done for daily tasks. For gaming, a headset will definitely be appreciated, as the speakers aren’t what you would want for games. It also comes with something that I now consider a must have in any laptop; a backlit keyboard. Once you have one, you can never go back. Even my “casual user” father who has recently just gotten a backlit keyboard says he is a lifesaver in the dark.\n\n**Internals -** Inside this laptop is where things get special, easily and quickly handling day to day tasks such as web browsing, college work, watching videos or writing emails. Equipped with a new 6core-6thread Ryzen 4000u series processor with integrated Vega 6 graphics (512mb Vram) and dual channel 8gb of ram, it has unbelievable power for the price. It can handle any game, albeit with some lower framerates and graphical sacrifices. Games like League of Legends can run 1080p higher graphics at 60+ fps, while games like Call of Duty and Apex will need to see low graphics 720p to have a “playable” framerate of \\~40fps. There is already extensive game benchmarking on youtube, so i will not be covering that in this video. Links in the description for channels that have done that. The Lenovo Ideapad 5 has the expected Wifi 6 card and Bluetooth 5.0. My model came with a 256gb ssd and 3 cell 57WH battery, that Lenovo says lasts up to 14 hours, although i would expect more of a 8 or 9 hour lifespan out of this laptop while doing basic tasks, and even less when gaming.\n\n**Fan Noise/Cooling -** Fan noise and cooling is perhaps the most underlooked part of this laptop. During average use, such as me writing this review, the fans do not even turn on, and the laptop is cool as can be. During gaming, the laptop fans kick on and off, keeping the CPU temperature at around \\~60C, which is shockingly cool, but still can cause some warmth on the keyboard deck. Part of these numbers comes from the stand I have for the laptop, but using it flat on a table should yield similar results. Like any laptop however, using it on a bed or soft surface is not good, as it will cover the vents and suffocate the internals, causing quicker deterioration of the laptop. \n\n**Conclusion -** In conclusion this laptop is stellar for the price, and truly revolutionizes what a consumer should expect from the budget laptop market. A reasonable screen, surprisingly good keyboard, features that even premium laptops can leave out, and shockingly powerful internal components, this laptop is worth every penny. If you are looking for a jack of all trades, professional looking laptop that can low-key handle gaming, the Lenovo Ideapad 5 with a Ryzen 4000u series processor is perfect for you. However, if you are a video editor, content creator, artist, or graphical designer, the poor color accuracy and backlight bleed mean you should look elsewhere for a more suitable laptop.",
  "It seems kind of strange that you would put in: \n“There is already extensive game benchmarking on YouTube, so I will not be covering that in this video.”\n\nDid you make a video about this too?",
  "Ahh I'm so excited to get mine! Should be arriving in a couple of weeks. I ordered a custom 15\" model from the lenovo website (in the UK). I was able to choose a 100% sRGB screen so I'm hoping that'll be good, colour is important to me because i'll probably use it for photoshop, but it won't be a big deal for most people. I also got 16GB of ram so it'll be a beast!\n\nThe price was INSANE for the specs. I was able to knock off about £100 by getting rid of Windows (I'll either use linux or just buy a cheap windows key), so it was only £450! A laptop with those specs would've been hundreds more at retail.",
  "i just got mine in the mail a couple of days ago. i was trying to put in a 2.5\" drive but I couldn't pry off the back panel. I saw a total of 7 screws but now wasn't so sure. did you bump into any problems taking the back off of your laptop?",

  "First Lenovo Ideapad S540 review - Less than 1000€, good gaming perfs, premium looks, 12h battery The first review for the Ideapad S540, which is a laptop that i'm monitoring closely, just dropped [on a Netherlands website](https://tweakers.net/reviews/7260/5/lenovo-ideapad-s540-goedkoopste-gtx-1650-laptop-doet-veel-goed-conclusie.html).\n\nHere's a quick translation i made using DeepL, TL;DR, it's a very good machine.\n\n**Pros :**\n\n- sleek premium design\n\n- great value for money\n\n- solid gaming performance\n\n- insane battery life\n\n**Cons :**\n\n- 4 GB of soldered RAM on all models. Unfortunately limits upgrade potential to a total of 20GB if you replace the second 4GB stick with a 16GB. \n\n**Specs**\n\nHere are the specs for the reviewed unit. **Keep it mind that this is the cheapest configuration, at €799**. It can be upgraded with up to 12GB RAM, a Core i7, and a 1TB SSD.\n\nScreen : 15.6\" FullHD\n\nCPU : Intel Core i5-8265U\n\nGPU : Intel UHD 620 // Nvidia GTX 1650 Max-Q\n\nRAM : 4GB DDR4 soldered + 4GB DDR4\n\nStorage : 256 GB SSD\n\n**Build Quality** : fully made of aluminum, sturdy and premium-looking. Weights around 1.9 kg. Good touchpad and keyboard, there's a fingerprint sensor and a webcam shutter.\n\n**Screen :** 1080p, good quality, very good colors, average brightness (not doing too great outdoors).\n\n**Performance** : Here are the [CPU benchmarks](https://tweakers.net/reviews/7260/2/lenovo-ideapad-s540-goedkoopste-gtx-1650-laptop-doet-veel-goed-specificaties-en-cpu-benchmarks.html) and [gaming benchmarks](https://tweakers.net/reviews/7260/3/lenovo-ideapad-s540-goedkoopste-gtx-1650-laptop-doet-veel-goed-gpu-benchmarks-en-games.html). Performance is generally around the level of the MSI PS63 modern or the Dell XPS15. In game the difference with a \"normal\" GTX1650 is negligible. Reaches 45 FPS in Rise of the Tomb Raider on Ultra Settings, 70 FPS on medium. \n\n**Battery Life :** 70wh battery. Battery tests show results of 12.5 hours of battery life in a web browsing test, and 3.5 hours in the PCMark 8 benchmark (emulates video editing or light gaming). \n\n**Conclusion :** this laptop looks like an amazing product for uni students, interns or young professionals that want a laptop that can be used both in a professional environment and a solid gaming machine if you're willing to either play most recent games below 60 FPS or crank the settings down to high or medium.\n\nThe only drawback i see is the soldered RAM, but is having more than 20GB so important when looking at the rest of the specs ? 256gb of storage is pretty low on the entry model, so i'd rather advise looking at the 512gb and 1tb units.\n\nNow lenovo, get a move on and release this thing in all countries before the end of summer, pretty please ?",
  "Would you recommend upgrading the ram to 20gb or just stay at 8gb?",
  "Do you know if they deliver outside of the Netherlands?",
  "Hi! Thanks for your review. I read that the fan-noise is very high-pitched. Can you confirm this/does it bother you?",
  "Depends on your use, I'd say test out 8gb and upgrade when you feel you need more ?",
  "dunno. The website being only available in dutch really doesn't help. Keyboard layout may be messed up too.",
  "Should I buy the Lenovo ideapad gaming 3? So I have the option of getting the Lenovo ideapad gaming 3 for the equivalent price of around $800 with these specs:\n\n1920×1080 FHD LCD 120Hz with FreeSync\nRyzen 5 4600H\nNvidia GTX 1650 4gb GDDR6\n45Wh battery \n8gb DDR4 RAM, speed not listed.\n512 GB NVME SSD\n\nI'm a student so I can't go over $800 in budget, and this is the cheapest gaming laptop in my country at the time of writing this. If I want to buy another laptop under this price then I'll need to import, but that'll mean I lose warranty, which I care about.\nI plan on keeping it for atleast 5 years, and i don't really play AAA titles, mostly just csgo and rocket league, and maybe some GTA, but I'd like to have it run some intensive titles on medium settings if I ever do decide to play them.\nAlso down the line I might upgrade the ram to 16gb, since every review said the laptop has 2 ram slots.\nThe colour accuracy and reproduction doesn't really matter since I don't do any editing work at all, but I'll be coding on the machine so it'll need to be able to do that pretty well.\n\nThe closest competition to this that I could find was the Acer nitro 5 with around the same specs, but I've heard the keyboard on that laptop wasn't very comfortable to use, and that the response times of the display were worse. Any suggestions?",
  "The Ideapad gaming 3 is a good laptop. All of the specs are good for the price and the thermals aren't bad. The only problem is that the battery only lasts about 5-6Hrs on light tasks, so if you are a student this may be an issue. Otherwise it is a great laptop. I have this laptop and the CPU performance is very good, as I use the ideapad mostly for coding. If you are ok with the nitros keyboard and the lack of warranty, the nitro would be more value as it also has better battery life and is cheaper. But if the keyboard and the warranty is important (the keyboard is important if you are doing coding as you'll need to type for extended periods of time), go for the ideapad. The ideapad is also slightly lighter and better built than the nitro according to what I have heard. But watch online reviews before buying anything. There also is the Asus tuf A15 but I don't know much about it. Check that laptop out. In conclusion, the Tuf A15, and the nitro are the competitors to the ideapad in your price range, for coding I would recommend the Ideapad due to the better keyboard, I don't know much about the TUF A15 so check that laptop before buying.",

If we go to specifics, both have same cores and threads, 95% details are same between those twooo.\n\nThe only difference is:\n\n* **7735HS** is 15% better in multi-core performance than 7735U.

I wanted to buy a traditional desktop but using it for university next year isn't very viable for transportation and my current laptop has been on life support for the past 5 years. \n\nMy current laptop is the Lenovo ThinkPad T495 which has a broken screen with wires everywhere; my monitor, my peripherals, charging 24/7. I've come to accept that while I enjoy gaming on it, it's running out of storage eerily fast with less than 10GB of storage left, and it has integrated graphics. Hell, I'm surprised it even opened Fortnite 3 years ago. \n\nI was looking to purchase an ROG laptop, but I was contemplating because there's 3 lineups with different specs that look really confusing. A while ago, I wanted to look into the Razer Blade lineup, but I chose not to after seeing Salem Techsperts' review. I know I should be buying something that I want, but I have no idea what I want because I'm used to only owning my one life-supported crappy laptop. \n\nI'm looking for Windows suggestions. An ideal price would be ~$2,000. I don't plan on buying a MacBook of any lineup because I'm not a huge fan of macOS. I don't care about any of Microsoft's AI powered bs. I want something that will last me several years, is extremely capable of gaming (actually has a laptop GPU), very preferable if it was 14 or 15 inches and **not** 16 inches, and is viable for school use. When I'm at home I plan to use this with a monitor. Any suggestions and tips help. Thank you!",

  "What laptop should I buy? Hey everyone! I’m planning to buy a new laptop soon, and I could really use some advice before making the final decision. My budget is around **$600 USD** or less, and I’m looking for a laptop that performs well, looks good, and works smoothly for daily tasks. I mainly need it for **work**, which involves a lot of **video calls**, so a decent **built-in webcam** is actually one of my top priorities. I also tend to have multiple apps and browser tabs open at once, so smooth **multitasking** is really important to me.\n\nOutside of work, I’d like the laptop to handle some casual gaming from time to time. It would be nice if it could run a few games comfortably without overheating or lagging. I also spend a fair amount of time streaming shows and videos, editing documents and presentations, and maybe doing some basic photo or video editing here and there when needed. Overall, I’m looking for a laptop that can handle everyday tasks with ease while still being enjoyable and comfortable to use.\n\nI’ve already done a bit of research and found a few models that seem to fit my needs, but I’m still not sure which one offers the best overall value. I’ll list them below with their prices, along with some quick notes on what I’ve found so far, but I’d love to hear your thoughts or any recommendations you might have.\n\n**$450 USD Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15IAH8**\\- 15.6\" FHD (TN, 250 nits) Intel Core i5-12450H (8 cores, 12 threads), 8GB (soldered) DDR5, 512GB SSD M.2 2242, 1080p Webcam, WiFi 6 , Bluetooth 5.2 , Windows 11 Home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the laptop's material feels cheap, it gets hot quickly, and the battery doesn't last long. It also struggles with gaming and can shut down randomly. While positive reviews say the image quality and Dolby audio are decent, and the camera is great for video calls. The performance is acceptable for work and school. It opens programs fast and charges quickly.\n\nThe second laptop is the same Lenovo laptop but it's the one with an **AMD Ryzen 5 7520U** processor, it does have some other differences so these are the full specs: AMD Ryzen 5 7520U (4C/8T, 2.8/4.3GHz, 2MB L2/4MB L3) 16GB RAM | 512GB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe | 15.6\" matte screen | Windows 11 Home (and Pro on another site). Camera: HD 720p with a privacy shutter.\n\nNegative reviews say that the display isn’t very bright, that it lacks touch functionality, and that the colors have a slight greenish tint. They trash the webcam, saying it's only 720p and not great. The hinge goes all the way back, and the keyboard isn’t backlit. The fan can get noisy during gameplay too.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has an impressive battery life, lasting about 10-11 hours with regular use. The 1080p display is decent, and the built-in speakers sound pretty good. The keyboard is snappy, and the large trackpad is accurate. It has a fingerprint reader for extra security, and you can even open the laptop with one hand.\n\n**$550 Acer Aspire Lite** 15.6\" FHD, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 8 cores Windows 11 Home | integrated AMD Radeon Graphics.

It's not suitable for video and photo editing. The webcam is mediocre, not the best one, basically.\n\nPositive reviews say that the battery lasts 7 hours and it charges fully in 1 hour. One review even said that the webcam quality was decent enough.\n\n**$550 ASUS Vivobook 15** AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 16 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM 512 GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD 8 cores integrated AMD Radeon Graphics - 15.6″ FHD windows 11 home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the battery life is not quite long enough to last a full day of work or classes. 1080p display has a cool tint, and it’s heavy at 3.8 pounds.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has above-average build quality and, reliable fingerprint reader on its trackpad. Its backlit keyboard was quiet and satisfying to type on, and its trackpad worked well.\n\nI don't know if this changes anything, but I'm based in Latin America, so do with that information what you will.

  "IdeaPad Pro 5i Ultra 9 285H – Arc 140T vs RTX 5050… worth the jump? Hey everyone,\n\nI’m torn between two configs of the new Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i (16″) and could use some real-world feedback:\n\nOption 1: Intel Ultra 9 285H + Integrated Intel Arc 140T\n\nOption 2: Intel Ultra 9 285H + NVIDIA RTX 5050 (8 GB GDDR7)\n\n\nMy situation:\n\nI’ll be using it for school (coding, multitasking, note-taking), daily productivity, and some AI/model work.\n\nI am into video editing so ill be using that a lot.\n\nI also game occasionally (The Witcher 3, warframe, sekiro), but not full-time gamer level.\n\nI like the idea of switching between iGPU and dGPU for battery life vs performance (if that even an option).\n\nI’ve heard the Arc 140T is fine for light gaming and GPU-accelerated work, but it’s nowhere near RTX-level performance.\n\nI cant find review for RTX 5050 with the Ultra 9 285H combo.\n\n\nConcerns:\n\nHow is the battery life in comparison?\n\nDoes the RTX 5050 version get noticeably hotter and louder compared to the Arc-only version?\n\nCan you switch modes between igpu and dgpu?\n\nIs the RTX 5050 worth the extra cost and battery trade-off for occasional gaming and heavier GPU workloads? Or is Arc 140T more than enough for my use case?\n\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who owns either version (or has experience with similar configs) — especially thoughts on thermals, noise, battery life, and GPU switching.\n\nThanks in advance!",
  "I understand there’s Lenovo Vantage software that lets you customize your laptop settings. With the IdeaPad Pro 5i, is it possible to use the iGPU as the default, even when gaming, and only switch to the RTX 5050 whenever I want to?",

  "I have the 285H + rtx 5050 variant, 32gb / 1TB\n\nYou probably already got the laptop, but from my experience, when you put it on battery saver mode with energy savings, the laptop stays cool, and the fans are minimal. You cant even hear them even in a silent room unless you touch your ears with the vents, you can hear a slight noise but I dont know if thats the cpu noise or fans. Even then, It still runs fast. I dont feel limited even on battery saving modes. I get 6-10 hours of battery life depending on the modes. You could probably get 11+ hours if you optmized settings and usage. And gaming performance is great. 120-130fps in Warzone 1080p with dlss on quality. 600-700 fps in minecraft, vanilla, you know. The laptop gets hot when playing games depending on your rooms ambient temp, but thats a good thing when it comes to ideapad laptops. If they dont get hot, that means theres dust build up and insulation, which will lead to thermal throttling and degraded performance when playing games and louder fans on normal usage. Other than that, very good laptop. Its a \"jack of all trades, master of none, yet oftentimes better than a master of one.\"",

  "How's the Oled screen? I've heard/seen that Oleds have some flickering issues when they are on low britghness and could cause some headaches?  \nCan you please help me with your feedback? I am thinking to buy the same model.  \nThanks!",
  "Are you saying it would use both graphic cards (Intel and Nvidia) during activities like browsing, watching videos and working with spreadsheets?",
  "I've also heard that before, and that's something that I was also concerned with even for my Samsung phone. But 3 months in with this OLED laptop, and I haven't had a single issue with the screen. My eyes don't feel uncomfortable at all even during long gaming sessions when I stare at the screen without blinking for a while. The OLED is really nice and really bright. At school, I have it on low brightness all the time and I personally haven't had an issue with it affecting my eyes. But one thing that reviewers point out and something that could be an annoyance to you is the reflectiveness of the screen. Personally, I like the reflection. It makes it feel more premium and I can see anyone who's staring at my screen without turning around. But other than that, I have no problems with the OLED on this laptop.",
  "Usually for light tasks like watching videos, streams, browsing, or any productivity, the RTX 5050 will not be used. But, when you have multiple windows open and a game, then you'll see both GPUs being used.",
  "swift go 14 sfg14-72-53bp (125H, OLED) UPDATE: 4 months later. i love love love it. it's perfect for me. a 14\" MBP that can do everything that i could ever imagine. no problems thus far. :fingers\\_crossed:\n\n[https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72-53bp](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72-53bp)\n\ni was writing a comment on [Im planning on getting the Acer Swift Go 14 with the oled screen... is this a good idea? : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1dh9jne/im_planning_on_getting_the_acer_swift_go_14_with/) and basically ended up writing a review, so:\n\nI just got the 125H version (mis-posted as 135H) off eBay for $550 \"like new\"/\"open box\". It's incredible, especially when coming from a limiting chromebook and an even more limiting iPad mini, lol! The 125H goes for $850 and the 155H goes for $1000 on the Acer US store.\n\nof note: the older [Acer Swift X 13500H RTX 3050 version](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-x-14-laptop-sfx14-71g-5911) (an older *non-touch* IPS screen) is going for $800 new! That's a significantly better gpu, but likely more power-hungry and perhaps limited by the 65w battery and even 100w charger, but who knows: those AMD ryzens seem to do way better than the intels of their time. Highly likely to find one going for a low price compared to bigger names. The next jump is at $1300 for a new swift go 14\" 155H rtx 4050.\n\nhere's a quick useful video review about it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3I3q48674&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3I3q48674&t=180s)\n\nmajor notes:\n\n* **the version with the OLED screen does not have touch input.** I found this out the hard way. :( I guess i assumed that the swift's \"go\" series was like \"flipbook\" and \"spin\", in that the touch-screen is it's main feature, without the flipping/spinning part. I was wrong. (the 155H version has touch-screen: [SFG14-72T-71QF](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72t-71qf) along with a 16\" version. Look for the icon with a finger pointing.)\n\nmajor cons:\n\n* the battery life is lower compared to other ultrabooks, maybe 6-10 hours vs 10-14 hours zenbook, perhaps due to the 65w vs 75w battery(?). I can't say yet, and maybe windows (and it's bloatware) is still doing something, but i got 10 hours on my first three charges, draining at \\~10%/hour; But i also always use minimum brightness, and just had the normal 30 tabs open (edge, most tabs sleeping) with music playing. Conversely, perhaps because it has a smaller battery, it charges very very quickly: an hour or so (with the given charger). It's also nice that usb-c was standardized for charging, though i wished the usb-c cable would detach from the power block... A minor gripe. After the first few drains, i've kept the laptop charged, and used some pre-installed Acer program to limit charging when plugged-in (to 80%, no choice). This really is it's only major con.\n* the OLED is glossy. so glossy you can see a deep, deep, and rich reflection of yourself. It's like looking into a dark mass of water. It raises self-awareness and horror :cold\\_face:\n\nproblems likely similar to other ultrabooks, and other notes:\n\n* fan noise, and heat. when it speeds up, it's clearly audible in a quiet bedroom when it starts up. it can start with very little computering ([the zenbook got panned in a review for being worse](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Zenbook-14-OLED-review-The-1-2-kg-subnotebook-with-120-Hz-OLED-and-Core-Ultra-7.805236.0.html)), then it goes back to silent mode, and thankfully, *stays* silent. And when it's silent, it's *absolutely* silent! It's apparently not louder than it's competitors tho?? sounds fine to me... *Thank goodness!* Along with fan noise, it can get a little warm at the palms. I think this happened during the beginning of it charging. Thankfully, the aluminum(?) case ensures it cools down quickly, and keeps it cool. (this is my portable-desktop-laptop, wherein i plan to use a separate mechanical keyboard most of the time anyway). However, when it's not charging, it seems to stay quiet 'n cool, which is the most important time.\n* the speakers are bass-less, but the amp is surprisingly incredible(!!).. but then again, i've never heard good laptop speakers in my life. Zero bass, which i'm okay with, as i'm a dreamy-pop treble music person, but just say no to lo-fi/city-pop. It's interesting to hear bass guitars without the bass.. It reminds me of my old purple 'n gold ATH-AD700 headphones that i adore, but far worse mixing. The audio goes through some artificial spatial surround sound software: the mids seem to live recessed in the bottom center of the laptop (vocals), then are overtly forwarded to every direction / speaker in the artificial speaker system (piano), the highs are all over the place, moving from one part of the laptop to another; and the lows remind me of bad midi music. Your favorite music will *not* move you. You will however listen to your favorite music in a very different way.. Having said that, the speakers can get very loud, easily able to fill up a room(!!), and most importantly: beyerdynamic 300r 32ohm headphones sound great at a mere 10% volume!\n* the up and down arrow keys share a single key area. I use wasd for gaming, so it doesn't bother me. This also keeps the keyboard's shape to a neat rectangle.\n* the left modifier keys aren't big. they're the same size as the letter 'n number keys. The right modifier keys, however, are slightly wider. They had to do this to make space for the function key. UPDATE: i re-mapped/swapped left-control with left-alt, mac-style. much better. i'll likely re-map holding caps-lock to left-control too.\n* the keys feel only slightly better than my $40 samsung chromebook 4, which, now that i'm looking at it, surprisingly, has the big fat left modifier keys and complete arrow keys too! Not bad, that thing! (for programmers the tilde key and delete keys are nice to have, and nicely placed, as are the half-size function/special keys... tho, i'm scared of what bloatware the acer key will manifest..!) UPDATE: in retrospect, it's actually a great keyboard. I ordered a keychron k6, and those red keys are god awful. Seriously, who want's to press a key down for a one-half inch?? I've become used to the tiny distance of laptop keyboards..\n* the 14\" screen is a huge surprise coming from an 11.6\" chromebook (2.4\" is a lot!) and even the 13.3\" macbook, yet it's dimensions are only very slightly larger (<1\"). There's about an inch of empty space on both sides of the keyboard--I'm the sort of person who saw the 15\" Macbook and thought, *\"ugh, what is all that space for!?\"*, and didn't buy one until the 13\" came out. The massive OLED screen gets as close as you'd want to the edges--any closer, your fingerprints would smudge the beautiful screen when opening/closing it. As does the massive trackpad.\n* the bigger touchpad may cause more accidents. I haven't had enough experience, but thus far, it seems fine for my hands, for the most part. I did have had it click on random parts of this review i'm writing quite a few times.. but then again, i'm currently sitting at a bad angle. UPDATE: i love it. bigger is better. i must have gotten used to it, as i don't accidentally touch it anymore..\n* the ports are perfect for me, as i'm not updated on current technology: two thunderbolt(?, new to me), two usb--one on each side!!!, one hmdi, a headphone jack, an sd card reader, and a good ol' kensington lock, lol. I've never used a lock before, but have always found it intriguing . I feel the port choices are very old-school, like me. :) It might be possible for 4 displays for this chip...!? (note: smaller 13.3\" laptops can compromise on ports)\n* bloatware. after 20 years, this still exists. Why? McAfee still exists..?? I did however use the 1 year of 100GB dropbox. Could someone please ship me a usb flash drive or sd card so that i can re-install windows? ;(\n\nwith all the similar \"ultrabooks\" (Asus zenbook, Lenovo yoga, HP spectre, Dell xps 14, maybe even the lower-end Acer spin, Asus flipbook, Asus vivobook, HP pavilion plus, Dell inspiron plus, 'n so on), i felt it's pretty hard to decide on one, and just went with what good deals i found on eBay, and checked the review on notebookcheck, and double-checked that the specs are indeed \"ultra\" (weight, size, build quality--not plastic).\n\nit's direct local (to Taiwan) competition is the asus zenbook, and i actually think that's a better notebook. Better speakers, better keyboard (i prefer big keys over the macbook chiclet-style), betters looks (premium business ultrabook vs macbook clone), lighter (an insane 1.3kg), and most importantly a better battery (75w vs 65w, 12+ hours vs 8 in tests!), but, notebookcheck's review noted a fan noise problem, due to it having a single fan / heat-sink vs this Acer's double fan 'n heat-sink. The problem could just be a fluke, but def worth researching other users experiences about it. Beyond that single problem though, i def prefer the zenbook. However, if a macbook clone is what you're really into, this Acer is just that!: a 14\" Macbook Pro (possibly for half the price due to bad resale value)\n\ni personally chose the Intel ultra series for it's great games/power balance, and x64 architecture. I missed out on the entire AMD marathon. An older asus rog flow x13 (g14 doesn't have touch-screen), razer blade 14, or microsoft surface pro (intel ultra series, not the newer ARM arch models) would have been my top choices, if i were to accept something more used. The previous gen surfaces were way too expensive! But i'm super stoked with what i got for $550. Wow! Also, i love Taiwan (made in Taiwan <3), so Acer 'n Asus were actually my top choices (they do all the hard work of making everything, and are absolutely lovely people with an incredible culture to behold, so let them have all my monies!). Actually, i've been fond of the swift series laptops, particularly swift 3 series and 5 series, ever since that time i went to a physical store to test 'n compare laptops. They were by far the best deals in the \"budget\" range. They were all ultrabooks in my eyes, for a fraction of the price of one.\n\nthe OLED is stunning. Now there's absolutely no need for a Macbook for me. My last one was a late-201313\" MBP. Hello again, Windows. How i've missed you dearly. And oh my, how you've accepted Linux..?? I don't even need Linux anymore, and that's coming from Arch! Also, having done some programming, i can't justify the sufferings that Apple has made programmers go through over its reign. Microsoft has since made a big turn towards accepting open-source, linux, programmers, etc. Strange, but good... i hope.\n\nfor my personal needs, the lower-resolution IPS touch-screen would've been ideal, for both touch input and possibly better gaming performance (*does native resolution matter nowadays..?*). It is indeed a major bummer. However, i feel that without the the ability to swivel the screen around (\"convertible\"), it would've made an odd touch-screen experience anyway, quite different from tablets. Also very important to note, **there's quite a few touch-screen OLED notebooks--**[**including the zenbook**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/13wdvxm/oled_touchscreen_is_awful/)**--, that suffer from a grainy screen problem**--though, i don't know which exact models / year have this problem. So, in the end, i feel it was more of a blessing. Anyway, i'm hoping my next job will pay for a premium laptop. At the moment, if money were not a factor, i'd go for either the Asus rog flow x13 or dreamy z13. The z13 is all i've ever dreamed for, ever since the iPad came out. ;) ...but i've read that even the z13 suffers from a very low battery life. :/\n\nUPDATE: now that i've got OLED, i can't imagine ever going back.. o.o\n\nso, if i were to choose again, a \"new\" 2022 asus rog flow x13 ryzen 7940HS would have been my choice, and very very surprisingly, it's going for a mere \\~$800!! So, unless you find a deal like mine, you should just go for one of the best out there! Otherwise, this is an incredibly solid laptop for its price. It has also easily convinced me macbooks aren't worth it anymore, as it was a decade ago, even considering the newer ARM M-series. I'm a believer of Acer/Asus/Taiwan!",
  "Is the fan noise not that big of a deal? I plan to buy this same model, and will be using this inside my university's computer laboratory. And I don't want to distract others with the fan noise.",
  "I bought my Acer Swift Go 14 on September 28, featuring an Ultra 5 125H processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and a 90Hz OLED HDR display running Windows 11 (23H2). I got it for 60,000 INR after discounts, down from around 80K. My previous laptop was the ASUS FX504, which I used for 6 years.\n\n# Negatives:\n\n* Wi-Fi Speeds & Performance: The ASUS consistently outperforms the Acer in download speeds, and I occasionally feel a static sensation when touching the metal surface while charging.\n* Sharp Trackpad Edge & Heat During Charging: The trackpad edge is uncomfortable, and the right side gets hot while charging, making it tough to use on my lap.\n* Useless Copilot Key & Keyboard Backlight: I remapped the Copilot key to Ctrl using AutoHotKey, but the keyboard backlight turns off too quickly, which is frustrating.\n* AI Features & Webcam: The AI eye contact feature is poorly executed, and the wide-angle webcam captures too much of my surroundings.\n* Glossy Display: It's highly reflective, which isn't ideal for bright environments.\n\n# Positives:\n\n* Stunning Design & Trackpad: The laptop looks sleek, almost like a MacBook, and the massive trackpad is so good that I hardly use a mouse.\n* Solid Hinge & Great Keyboard: The hinge is easy to open with one hand and feels premium, while the keyboard is clicky and visually appealing.\n* Outstanding Display: It's bright and colorful, with excellent HDR for movies.\n* Useful AI Features & Decent Speakers: The AI background blurring and noise cancellation work well, and the speakers are good for a laptop.\n* Convenient Charging & Good I/O: I can use my phone's USB-C charger, and there are multiple USB ports and useful features.\n\n# Performance:\n\nWhile I haven't tested it with games or benchmarks yet, the Acer is significantly faster than my ASUS for everyday tasks. It handles multiple apps smoothly, even on battery.\n\n# Battery Life:\n\nYou can't expect stellar battery life with a high-resolution H-series processor. I got around 5 hours of SOT with regular use and 4 hours while looping a 4K movie. There are ways to extend battery life, but I prefer using it to its full potential since it stays on my desk most of the time.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nFor the price I paid, I believe I found the best laptop for my needs. I'm very satisfied overall. **For the full review, check out my post** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcerOfficial/comments/1g75rhv/new_acer_swift_go_14_ai_pcs_review/).

  "I can hear fan noise for a few seconds each time I turn on the Acer Swift Go laptop that I purchased from Costco.  However, it's generally very silent when watching youtube videos, browsing the web, and doing office work.  Can the fan noise be permanently controlled via BIOS (if I wanted to install Linux on the system) or is one forced to use the AcerSense app?  Frankly though, I've been spoiled by the Thinkpad laptops (X230, T450, and T460s) which are really silent.

Oh also, if you actually need to use windows, i’m not sure if windows even runs on ARM..?? (see link). And what about all those games/apps made for x64 or even older 32-bit? You’d have to research into Mac’s emulation. I would hope the x64 emulation is good, as it takes time to transition cpu architectures.. I personally just wouldn’t want to bother with all of this, so it better be dang good! The intel Macs was a good time imo, having Mac and windows run natively via boot camp. ARM, i have no idea. I haven’t bought a computer in a decade! lol. But that’s the reason I didn’t even bother with the surface pro with ARM (Snapdragon). The whole thing reminds me of proprietary charging cables. It’s not, but that’s how it feels.\n\nBut do note, I have two very strong biases: as a childhood gamer turned game maker, and having at one time the horrific experience of using objective-c and Xcode to make a game for iPad, I value being able to play games (and apps) and not adding more complexity to making games (and apps). Forcing people to buy a Mac product just to deploy to it is insane to me (though surely there’s a service for that now..). Adding restrictions such as which programming language you can use (no JIT, meanwhile Android runs on JVM..). I’ll take the messes that are windows and android/linux any-day.

  "Is the Lenovo ThinkPad E16 gen 2 with HS processors undervolted? If not do they overheat? Hi Reddit, This is Kavin. My laptop had stopped working recently. So I was wondering if I could get a reliable laptop that could last me for the maximum amount of time. Of course, my first preference was to get a ThinkPad. I've done my research across all the other brands and ended up looking at a ThinkPad, which is pretty good in terms of specs. One thing that ached me was that this exact model has a HS processor, which might be undervolted by Lenovo; if not, it might overheat.

  "NEVER buy asus laptops they are masters in pc motherboards but recently asus is horrible in laptops and their drivers and everything. for you or generally speaking Lenovo should always be your first option because it is with no doubt the best preformance per value in the market or you could also get a HP which are great but i favor Lenovo. and the ideapad slim 5 is THE BEST option, it has the best build quality and also does not break the bank.",
  "Best Laptop For Engineering in AI and Data Science Under $1164 Usecase : 1) as written above just for btech AI & DS, should be durable for 4-5 years.\n2) Gaming isn't priority at all and don't even need seprate GPU for that.\n3) Battery Backup has high priority, and then build quality should be good. \n4) no such brand priority at all but anything that is worth (with good reviews and company support) would be appreciated no matter what company \n\nI am thinking to buy this laptop : PRICE = $1000  (GETTING AT DISCOUNTED PRICE $970 AT AMAZON + 3 YEAR PLANS ) \nLenovo ideapad slim 5 ryzen 7 AI 350 (24 GB RAM | 1 TB | 14 inch | OLED )\nSO if you know anything better and more worth than this above laptop around the range of $1000-$1164 , it would be appreciated. \n",
  "Youre not gonna like me saying this but since your using lots of ai I would recommend a thinkpad p series maybe a p52. I'll give you some reasons.\n1. They are upgradeable and repairable\n2.

I currently use a DELL G15 gaming laptop, and its a living hell, heat, noise, you name it. Because of my previous bad experience with gaming laptops, I will not be getting a laptop with a dedicated GPU. As of right now, I have found a lot of laptops which meet the requirements of my uni, they are listed below:\n\n[ThinkPad X9 15 Aura Edition Intel (15ʺ)](https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx9/thinkpad-x9-aura-edition-15-inch-intel/21q6cto1wwca1) \\- For this laptop I customized it, I changed the SSD to 256 gigs, since its cheaper, this allows me to buy a ssd and install it for a lot less. I added the touchscreen feature and windows 11 pro, everything else remains the same. The current price of this laptop with all the discounts is $2,230\n\n[Zenbook S 16 (UM5606)](https://shop.asus.com/ca-en/asus-zenbook-s-16-um5606.html) \\- Online reviews aren't very nice to this laptop, multiple reviews online, youtube, blogs, and even reddit state that because of how thin the laptop is it struggles with heat at the at keyboard, and some people say it overheats too. Keeping that in mind, there are A LOT of positive reviews for it too. The current Price of this laptop is $2,200\n\n[MSI Prestige AI 16\"](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/msi-prestige-ai-16-qhd-laptop-stellar-grey-intel-core-ultra-7-evo-edition-2tb-ssd-32gb-ram-win11/17539020) \\- I haven't done any research for this laptop, however it meets the requirements and looks like a good laptop. The laptop is on sale for $1,800\n\n[HP Omnibook 7](https://www.costco.ca/hp-omnibook-7-copilot-pc-173-in-touchscreen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-7-258v-32-gb-ram-1-tb-ssd-intel-arc.product.4000367750.html) \\- This laptop is selling on costco right now for $1,650.

I just want to get a laptop which will last, has good build quality, and good specs. Having a good screen, a big keypad, etc, is all fun and good, but I'm not sure if its worth an additional $1000 dollars.\n\nI would like to provide a bit for info:\n\nI am going into the tech industry (software dev) but my program requires a few additional courses, in which I will be running VMs, compiling code, etc.\n\nAlso to add onto all of that, I do value a machine that doesn't sound like jet taking off, or is so hot it radiates heat. Battery life matters, weight matters so much, and thickness too! (A MacBook would be ideal but its a mac after all.)\n\nSorry if this post is super unorganized and what not lol, all that being said, below is \"THE FORM!\"\n\n# The Form\n\n**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** $2,500 CAD. Canada\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** No\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Form factor doesn't matter much, a traditional laptop is just fine, and so is a 2-in-1. I value build quality, performance, and battery. If I had to rank it, 1. Performance, 2. Battery, 3. Build Quality.\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Very. Since ill be going all over campus, I want the laptop to weigh under 1.5kg, thickness matters, but not so much. If the device is thin, it feels better, weighs less, and its cool as hell. But sometimes its so thin it can ruin the device. So, yeah i prefer the laptop to be thin, but its not required.\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** Above 15\".\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Watching videos, movies, etc. Light gaming, call it roblox, minecraft, etc. For programs I have no idea the programs I will be using in uni, but I do know I will be using VMs (Virtual Machines) and Visual Studio Code.\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**\\-fill here, remove dashes-\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Yes, a good keyboard, and reliable build quality. Touch screen is a gimmick to me, cool to have, not required. Finger-print reader/ windows hello, not required, good to have. A large-ish touchpad. Don't need external mouse or keyboard.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Thank you taking the time to read this, and please lmk if you have any questions, etc.\n\n\\--",
  "The ThinkPad X9 15\" or P16s G4 AMD are the best 2 options imo.

  "If you can afford it, the ThinkPad X9 15. It’s the most professional and dependable for the next 4–5 years.\n\nIf you’d rather save some money get the HP Omnibook 7.",

  "Options for general use + work Hello,\n\n  \nI'm looking for a laptop for general web browsing, but also would have to use it for work.\n\nAs for work, I need some basic office suits like document writings and also some programming/data analysis using Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy and scipy.\n\n  \nIt would be ideal that it would have a long battery life. I'm not interested in games.\n\n  \nI found some options that might fit my needs, although there are some notes that I may add further down below. These are my top 3 picks:\n\n  \n1. Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5\n\n* 13.3'' inch screen (100% sRGB)\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7735 HS\n* 16GB LPDDR5x-6400 RAM\n* 512GB SSD\n* Price: \\~ 940 USD\n\n2. Asus Vivobook 14\n\n* 14'' screen (45% NTSC)\n* Intel Core Ultra 5 225H\n* 16GB DDR5 on board (it doesn't specify the frequency)\n* 512 GB SSD\n* Price: \\~ 940 USD\n\n3. Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3\n\n* 14'' screen (45% NTSC)\n* Intel Core i5-13420H\n* 24GB DDR5-4800 MHz (8GB on board + 16GB SO-DIMM)\n* 512GB SSD\n* Price: \\~870 USD\n\n  \nSo, a few notes to be added. I was initially thinking of buying laptops with the U series intel CPUs. But could only find from past generations, at most 13th. By the way, the new Intel name scheme seems confusing to me. Why not keep the same nomenclature as before?!\n\n\n\nThe IdeaPad Slim 3 seems to me like a good option because of the increase in the RAM, even though the CPU is from 2 generations ago.\n\n\n\nI know the IdeaPad Slim 5 is also with a CPU from 2023, but I really like the idea of having a small and light laptop like this. I previously owned a heavy gaming laptop and it was horrible to carry it around everywhere. Looking for the opposite now, so this one looks like a good option. However, I'm also looking for long battery life, and I don't know how a HS CPU would affect this.\n\n  \nThe Asus has the most modern CPU, but I've seen a review where it states that the body, keyboard etc are not so good.\n\n  \nAt any rate, I would appreciate any comment on those options. Is the the new Ultra 5 worth it, even though the laptop itself is fragile and not good? Would the increase in RAM make the IdeaPad Slim 3 a better option on cost/benefit?",
  "All of those should be fine for your use cases. Personally I would choose number 3, because you could upgrade the RAM if you need to in future. Also for your programming are you going to be any machine learning tasks? If so, I might recommend getting a laptop with a GPU.",

List which programs/games you desire to run.** \n \nCAD yes, video editing/photo editing no, gaming would be nice but if the sacrifice is cost and battery life then probably not worth it for me. I have access to consoles so I can live without for now. \n \n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** \n \nIf I could play something like Cyberpunk, Ghost of Tsushima on high or greater at 60FPS that would be a dream come true but if it's limiting to a 2/3 hour battery it wouldn't be worth it to me. \n \n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** \n \nReliable build, good keyboard and input devices would be ideal.

  "Help choosing a laptop for accounting student – confused between Yoga 7i, ThinkPad X13, & Microsoft Surface 11 Pro (budget ca. 1000€)\" Hello!\n\nAfter my previous laptops (Huawei MateBook D14) screen broke after 6 years, with which I was priorly very satisfied and had no issues, I am searching for a new laptop.\n\nI am an accounting major and will need to do Data Analysis in R. Additionally I always like to keep a ton of tabs open during personal use and research for university. I am not planning to play games on my laptop. Additionally, I do not want to buy a refurbished laptop.\n\nMy budget is around 1000EUR, but if there is a better option above this price range, I could spend more. My priorities are:\n\n1. **Performance** \\- Laptop running smoothly during Data Analysis and having many tabs open.\n2. **Build Quality & Durability** – I would like the laptop to last at least 5 years. The quality of my previous MateBook D14 is a benchmark, since the laptop felt sleek & durable due to the aluminium build and good quality hinges.\n3. **Battery Life**\n4. **Thin and lightweight** \\- Weighing around 1,38kg (3,04lbs).\n5. **Size** – 14” is the perfect size, but a bit smaller is still okay.\n6. A **fingerprint scanner** would be nice.\n\nI have been on a deep dive and the more I search the more confused I get which laptop is best suited for me,  since I find too many contradicting reviews. My first thought was to get another Huawei laptop, since my previous experience was great, but I worry due to privacy issues and them not really being available on the EU market.\n\nI have seen Lenovo laptops recommended a lot, therefore I focused on those but I am also considering a Microsoft laptop.\n\nBelow I have made a table with an overview of the models I am considering.\n\nI like the aspect of having a 2-in-1 laptop, to mark-up literature and take notes by hand, but I am worried about the durability of the hinges. I saw many people hating on IdeaPad, therefore I avoided them.\n\nHere I have listed the different laptops I am considering. Since I am not tech savvy I would really appreciate answers to the following questions:\n\n1. Which model offers the best quality for the price in general, regardless of whether it is a normal laptop or a 2-in-1?\n2.  I see a lot of hate towards the Intel Core and people recommend the AMD. Would I notice the difference between the two, considering the described tasks I do?\n3. Which of these 2-in-1 laptops is the best quality for the price?\n4. Are there any other good laptops I have not considered yet?\n\n[Comparison Table](https://preview.redd.it/r36i87bd4zwe1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad4b9de132bc64664d26b03227743eb715f79708)\n\nThank you a lot in advance for your feedback!",

  "Just add another 8gb stick for cheap, you don't need 32gb of RAM on a lower end mid range setup.",

  "I would personally go with 16GB ram and then get 1TB SSD.",
  "That would definitely be a good upgrade candidate, especially if you can kit it out with dual channel. Ideally that 8GB onboard is one module with a free socket for a second one and you can have 16 GB ready to go, which is more than ample for most gaming purposes today.\n\nAlso: see if there is a second NVMe socket available. If yes, then get any good 1 TB SSD and voila, there's your Steam games drive ready to go.",
  "Light gaming 16 will work. Heavier gaming 32 will be NEEDED or close to it. Check specs on the RAM. Some manufacturers solder both RAM. Some solder only one which leaves you with a SODIMM slot. If you increase the RAM on the SODIMM slot try to keep the same frequency. Cause say you get 16 SODIMM  3400MHZ, and your soldered RAM IS 3KMHZ. The 3.4KMHZ will run as 3KMHZ.",

  "I think max is 32 for this one. If main goal is gaming, 16 is enought. For best match once you got it check with HWinfo exacr parameters or your ram and buy second 8Gb stick. Lenovo has several suppliers for ram - Kingston, Samsung and other. Better to check what is inside for better compatibility.",
  "So to answer the OP's question, No the original Laptop even throwing more RAM at it will not suffice for their purpose.  They will need to look at upgrading the storage as well.",
  "I checked the specs for this model. It has 2 m.2 slots, 1x 2242 that is pcie3.0x4 and 1x 2280 that is pcie3.0x2\n(The numbers are the physical size of the ssd)\nIt also has a slot for a 2.5\" ssd, but if you use this then the m.2 2280 will be disabled.\n\nThe amount of ram officially supported is 16GB 3200MHz ddr4 and it has 2 available ram slots. So 1 is already populated with 8gb. They do note that these are the officially tested max amounts but the system may support more ram as the \"technology develops\"\n\nThis model comes with a Ryzen APU which also means it had onboard Radeon graphics which will always eat a little bit of your ram, if you like it or not.\n\nLastly, this model only has USB-c data transfer, so no connecting your fancy external screen over USB-c, HDMI2.0 will have to do.\n\nAlso maybe fun to know is that there exist models that have WiFi6 and Bluetooth 5.1 (which is actually 5.2 capable of the OS supports it) or just WiFi 802.11ac with Bluetooth5.0.",
  "Thank's for the info m8. No disrespect intended.   16 is usually sufficient for most folks depending on their usage. Heavy gaming, video editing and such might need more.",
  "Thanks for tracking that info down! Saved me from buying wrong thing or spending more than I needed to.",
  "Sorry, one more question. I bought. Samsung 1 tb 980 pro ssd. Do they specs indicate there will be an open slot or do I have to clone it? I would like to do it same time as I add the ram instead of opening multiple times",
  "Yep, you're right",
  "Great info. I bought a 16 gb ram for it. Since there is an open slot should I leave existing 8gb in there and add 16gb. Or just take out 8 and put 16 in? Or should I have bought two matching dual 8’s? Did a little research and got some conflicting info",
  "If i remember in BIOS is a option to limit max amount of ram reserved for iGPU",
  "Looking at that link, it \\*looks\\* like it is only using one of its two M.2 drives: it's fastest one (NVME).  \n\n\nThere is a second M.2 slot (non NVME, from what i can tell) that should be available, and also a space for a 2.5\" SATA drive, BUT you can only use one or the other of these when adding an additional drive, not both. And it looks like 1TB is the largest drive that either of those two spaces officially supports (while the fastest M.2 slot that's currently in use is only up to 512GB)",
  "In my config i have second m2 slot and also cage and calble to attach 2.5\" ssd if dont want to go m2 format.",
  "There is an open M.2 slot which Lenovo says only takes 1TB in 2280 form factor",
  "To run dual channel you should have 2 matching sticks. Since this is a Ryzen system the extra bandwidth that dual channel provides should give you a great performance bump.",
  "Yes, the minimum of RAM that you can assign to the iGPU is 512MB (up to a maximum of 4GB), but there is no possibility to turn it off completely.\n\nMaking my point still true ;)",
  "Thanks again for help and for translating the info",
  "I have [this one.](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-geek-squad-certified-refurbished-980-pro-1tb-internal-ssd-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-for-laptops/6432767.p?skuId=6432767) haven’t had a chance to put it in yet. Should work out ok 👍",
  "Ok, thanks. I will take back and get two 8gb rams instead",
  "Yeah only thing is I think the slot runs at PCIe 3x2 while physically being 3x4 due to some weird adapter thing. I'm waiting for a crucial p3 plus I bought to arrive so I can test that spec out",

Screen size should be around 14 inch not more than that\n3.budget 1 lakh \n4.should be future proof with best battery life\n5.weight should not exceed 1.5kg\n\nAlso if someone has query why I don't want mac so the answer is I talked to many college students and they said many proffs use windows laptop only and some apps don't work in macbook also I am personally scared service/repair cost of macbook \n\n\nThanks in advance too everyone who can help me with this ♥️\n",
  "This is used, ask the seller if they ship to India and if not, you can use a freight forwarder like MyUS if the seller allows it:\n\n[https://www.ebay.com/itm/256810297126](https://www.ebay.com/itm/256810297126)\n\nThough it is used, it is open-box and is under your budget whilst ticking all of your boxes, iGPU from the CPU should be enough for running multiple windows of VSCode and other coding applications and power efficient enough for a decent battery life.\n\nComes with a 3K OLED 120Hz screen, can lower to 1080p for coding and for the occasional gaming and 3K for content consumption (it is NOT a gaming laptop but the iGPU should be powerful enough for [light 1080p gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs0tPnmkIVg) and more than enough for schoolwork).\n\nAlso comes with 24GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, which should be sufficient for coding workloads and files too.\n\nThe price in Rupees is 77,679.03INR as of writing, the 23k leeway should be enough to cover shipping to India.\n\nIf you want the best bang-for-buck, used is the best way to go, and eBay has very good buyer protection in case anything goes wrong. I recommend if you do buy the laptop to record your unboxing and testing of the laptop upon unboxing as evidence in case there are issues with the laptop.\n\nAlso, I would recommend spending your extra budget on thermal pads (PTM 7950 is tried and tested) for your CPU for better thermals and slightly better battery life (lower temps), and reinstalling Windows 11 once you receive the laptop to get rid of bloatware.\n\nLastly, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts) to activate your fresh W11 copy without buying a key (you can check it's legitimacy, I used it myself to activate Windows on both my PC and laptop).\n\nHope this helps!\n\nP.S. If by the time you check the laptop is unavailable, just look for other Vivobook or Zenbook laptops on eBay that are 14\" with a Ryzen AI 9 x CPU since the iGPU on this chip is good for price-to-performance.",

I have asus vivobook (I was also recently shopping for a budget gaming laptop, although with a slightly higher budget - up to 800 usd in my country) and one of the good thing about it is that the fans are superb.

  "Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5i VS Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 I got 2 laptops from Lenovo on sale to compare them before deciding which to get.\n\nIdeaPad Slim 5i: 646$ after tax\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS w/ Radeon 780M Graphics 3.8 GHz\n\nYoga Slim 7: 1046$ after tax\n\n* Intel Core Ultra 7 256V 2.20GHz w/ Intel Arc 140V GPU (8GB)\n\n  \nFrom all the reviews of the Yoga Slim 7, I've seen that the iGPU for the Ultra 7 256V (Intel Arc 140V) should be a great one and a much better improvement on previous iGPUs. They also run games on it and it works pretty well (but they usually use the 258V which has the same GPU).\n\nFrom testing however, I found that the AMD one is performing much better. I'm using Fortnite as a comparison/reference: AMD was able to run smoothly with Medium preset settings while the Intel one quite literally blue screened me and crashed the laptop twice. Eventually I got it to work, but at less than 30fps while the AMD one held \\~60fps or more. After benchmarking the two with Heaven Benchmark 4.0 these are the results:\n\nIdeaPad Slim 5i (Radeon 780M)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5jv6spcpb5e1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fd5e9e069a998a2255d61c93f4aae0ac5b34cb5\n\nYoga Slim 7 (Arc 140V)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/au7bmplmpb5e1.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29549343eb22e47790a344adabaf8b0245deeec\n\nHere's my question: How could a 500$ cheaper laptop perform better? Is this something with the settings or drivers (I updated all drivers)? I made sure both screens had the same refresh rate and resolution for a fair comparison too. Both laptops' battery lives are equivalent and the only difference between the two is that the Yoga has a really good display. I'm kinda lost here. I'm considering returning the Yoga but I'm worried I might just not be using it right.",
  "obviously one cpu is better. Price doesn’t always = best.",

  "Need a system for productivity, VM work, and light gaming with good battery I get into a lot of network simulation like GNS3 and EveNG to run network devices and systems VMs. I also am taking some online ethical hacking courses that uses a lot of VMs for Linux and windows. I don’t like staying plugged in all the time, so I’m trying to find a good mix.\n\nLast year i bought the Yoga Slim 9i 16” and it was fantastic except the battery. That was a joke. It would die with casual use within 2-3 hours or less, and that was with me turning down settings and going to 60hz. If that’s how it needs to be used, what’s the point of all the extra power and features? So I sold it. My 15” MacBook Air M2 has been working out for productivity, but I really need a Windows system back for my VM and simulation stuff. I also miss gaming a little here and there. \n\nI am just not sure what will end up being more important to me feature wise (screen, weight, battery, dGPU etc). I am looking at three systems and leaning towards AMD for battery life, but the Core Ultra 9 185h has more cores for VM work and seems to do ok on battery depending on the system. I also love a good screen, but I don’t do a lot of media consumption really. I don’t know I will actually take advantage of miniLED/OLED or not.\n\nThree systems:\nLenovo Yoga Pro 9 w/o miniLED 32Gb, Intel 185H, 4050 (IPS version is on sale for 1299 at Best Buy. The miniLED version is $600 more because it isn’t on sale, and that’s too much extra)\nLenovo Thinkpad P16s Gen 2 w/ 7840u, 64gb ram, 1tb SSD, 4k OLED 60hz New in Box for $910 (AMD does ok casual gaming, so no dGPU is ok but I kinda prefer one)\nLenovo Ideapad Pro 5 w/ Intel Ultra 9 185H, 32Gb ram, 4050, 2k OLED 120hz refurbished for $850. (Has mixed reviews and a loud track which can annoy me)\n\nI am also trying to stick to under $1500.\n\nIf anybody else knows of something, my needs are:\n16” Nice screen w/ higher resolution (doesn’t have to be 4k) don’t care about high refresh rate on laptops. I’ve had it, and it didn’t much for me.\n32-64GB of ram (VMs take up a lot of ram)\nMany CORES (Ultra 9 has more than 8840U or HS, but not sure how much that will impact VM use)\nGood battery life without having to make it feel like a $300 laptop in features.\nNumberpad - Inputting IP address on a top row of keys is horrible. I have to do that some when i work remote for my job since my work laptop is 14”\n\nThere are a ton of options that fit all of this except battery life. It sucks to constantly worry about plugging in to keep working. I wanted the new Ryzen Ai 370 but there are no systems that meet my criteria except one new MSi system that is priced too high for the specs. I wish I didn’t want the numpad, but I really need it.\n",
