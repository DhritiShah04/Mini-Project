  "Ideapad pro 5 battery question I'm planning to buy this for college, it have u7 155h, an 84wh battery with Intel EVO qualified, I love how it have rtx 4050+intel arc combination however I wonder I doubt if the 4050 will allow laptop battery to last more than 4-5 hours...have anyone bought/use this model before? Can anyone leave me a review, thought on this?",
  "If the GPU isn't in use, it can probably manage at least 4 hours. If it is, theres no way its making it past 5.",
  "That's what I worry about, because some page said it don't have Mux switch, aka the gpu always online, HOWEVER, it have Intel Evo qualification which indicate 9.5hr+ for office, quiet a contradict thingy T_T",
  "Those qualifications don't really mean much, I haven't ever found a products claimed battery life to be true in real-world use. My 19 hour battery laptop lasts maybe 6-8 hours with just a web browser.\n\nI would hope you have a mux switch, but I would never buy that pos so I couldn't tell you for sure :/ \\*most likely\\* you do.",
  "Thank you for your advicee, I would keep in it mind and do some more research, the rea life battery does tend to be shorter than claim",
  "Lenovo bad. HP better? IdeaPad Pro 5 (8845HS) and Yoga Pro 7 (155H) vs Omnibook Ultra 14 (AI 365) Hi everyone!  \nSorry for the click-bait topic. I want to ask about buying HP over Lenovo. In order to make this post more valuable, I'll write down a short review of the Lenovo laptops because I found many people are looking for similar things in a laptop as me. Also including the OLED vs IPS opinion. I'll add 8845HS vs 155H review later.\n\nOriginally, I wrote a long post, but I didn't save it and it got lost. I'll try to make it short this time.\n\n**What am I looking for?**  \nI want a small work laptop that I could also use for my personal things. It should have good CPU, 32GB of RAM and 100% sRGB because I intend to use it for editing photos while traveling. I also wanted iGPU because it's good enough for the tasks I intend to use it for.\n\n**Why I don't want OLED**  \nOLED screen is dominant in the class of laptops I am looking at. And generally it's a selling point of many laptops. I understand why, but it's no good for my use-case.  \nI use a lot of static content Programming/Lightroom/Web and when I am working, I want to use my laptop as a second screen, which means opened browser or a VS Code for extended periods of time. Of course, this is exactly the use-case that's not great for OLEDs. I also went to a local shop and I saw that the OLED screens have a burn in. I understand that the laptops might be there for a long time, but still.. I don't want to limit my productivity to mitigate something that's going to happen sooner or later. Also the eye strain is real. So it's an IPS for me.\n\n**IdeaPad Pro 5 14AHP9**  \nThis was a big step up from ThinkPad E590 I had before. The performance is great. It's even better than 5600X I have in my PC. But I was being worried about the OLED burn in too much in the long run. Otherwise it was a perfect choice for me. \n\nPros:  \n\\- Very good specs  \n\\- Full metal case  \n\\- Good keyboard  \n\\- Good connectivity with 2 USB-C (USB-4), 2 USB-A and a SD card reader  \n\\- 85Wh battery  \n\\- **Quiet**\n\nCons:  \n\\- Very limited customizations  \n  ThrottleStop doesn't support 8845HS, you can't do much in the BIOS, you can't adjust fan curve  \n\\- OLED burn in  \n\\- 240Hz PWM\n\n**Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14IMH9**  \nI was hesitant to choose Intel because I believe AMD is better, but it has a nice IPS display and it fit my requirements perfectly.  \nI don't know if it's because of the Intel processor, but it's **loud.** Every time it get's above 60C, the fans just start spinning for some time. The CPU reaches 38C in the mean time. WHY?. And it happens even while browsing. The fans are also very high-pitched and annoying. The fan curve from Lenovo is terrible and I couldn't change it. It behaves like that in all power modes. Lenovo restricts any customization for some reason. It's very annoying and that's basically the only reason why I am looking for some other options.\n\nPros:  \n\\- IPS with 100% sRGB  \n\\- Very good specs  \n\\- Full metal case  \n\\- Good keyboard  \n\\- Thunderbolt 4  \n\\- 14.5\" display with minimal overall size change  \n\\- Good light use efficiency thanks to E-cores\n\nCons:  \n\\- Terrible fan curve (loud)  \n\\- Power button located on the side means accidental shut downs  \n\\- Only one USB-A  \n\\- Very limited customizations  \n  ThrottleStop doesn't support 8845HS, you can't do much in the BIOS, you can't adjust fan curve\n\n  \n**IdeaPad Pro 5 14AHP9 vs Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14IMH9**  \nBoth look very much the same and I really like the design. Yoga is a bit larger thanks to the 14.5\" display which is better for productivity and you can't really tell when carrying it.  \nThe build quality is better on the Yoga. It has a more premium feeling, but it's really not noticeable. The only noticeable things are the bezel around the screen is glass vs plastic on the IdeaPad. Another thing is keyboard, which is meant to feel more premium on the Yoga. It has a great travel but it's harder to press than on IdeaPad that's why I prefer the IdeaPad keyboard.\n\n**Ryzen 9 8845HS vs Intel 155H**  \nAMD is definitely more power efficient during moderate tasks. I think it's also part of the reason why IdeaPad is more quiet. \n\n**HP OmniBook Ultra 14 (AI 365)**  \nThis is an option I am looking into and I want your opinion on it. It's about 150$ more expensive, but it has a newer ZEN 5.  \nI'll share my cons and pros about this laptop. What I would really appreciate is your experience with the noise. Also if you can do more customizations like a fan curve using FanControl.\n\nPros:  \n\\- ZEN 5 (quiet?)  \n\\- IPS with 100% sRGB  \n\\- More customizability?\n\nCons:  \n\\- Worse design  \n\\- Large bezel (the laptop is the size of Yoga which has 14.5\" vs 14\")  \n\\- USB-C in the corner  \n\\- More expensive  \n\nWhat I ultimately want to achieve (and what is achievable with the IdeaPad) is that I want my laptop dead silent during some light work.\n\nI hope somebody will be able to share their experience and help me decide. I also hope I could help somebody else decide!\n\nThanks!",
  "Did you end up picking up the omnibook ultra 14? I’m debating getting it but I’m hesitating because of the build quality and keyboard .. any feedback? :)",

  "Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro 16\" Review (Comparing to Dell/HP/Samsung) My old HP Envy broke so I purchased 3 consecutive laptops and returned them all. The new HP Envy screen made my eyes hurt, the dell Inspiron 16 had really odd sounding speakers and shut down randomly even after re-installing windows, and the Samsung Galaxy Pro Book was sleek and well built but the screen was very pixelated. All where Ryzen 7 besides the Galaxy which was i7\n\nThe fourth laptop I tried was the  Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro 16\" QHD Laptop with AMD Core Ryzen 5 5600H / 8GB RAM. I got it on sale for $500 and thought it would be very basic.\n\n1. The build is awesome and has the best keyboard out of all 4 laptops I've tried. Sleek and seems light but sturdy.\n2. Sounds is great and features like face-scan sign in are appreciated.\n3. Start up time is fast fast fast\n4. Also, I accidentally put a lot of my weight on the screen (laptop was shut) when trying to kill a bug on the wall and the screen survived no blemishes.\n\nCon:\n\n1. Matte screen is not super appealing but the more I use it the more I don't mind a matte screen at this price range.\n2. I would not want to pay $900 for this but if you can get it under $600 thats a real deal.\n\nThis is my first Lenovo and I am impressed so far, for $500 total paid this is an A+.",
  "I own the newer model of this with a Ryzen 6800HS RTX3050 and 16/512GB that I got for $1100 and I like it a lot. There is also a Ryzen 6600HS RTX3050 16/512GB for $840. An Intel 11300H MX450 8/512GB model for $530.\n\nThey all have the same display and build quality and its a pretty solid line up to pick out how much horsepower you need in this budget friendly yet premium design.",
  "Having owned the galaxy book pro, it doesn't use Ryzen. It's an Intel based laptop with Intel's evo certification.",
  "They all have the QLED matte screen?",
  "Hey, \nHow good is temperature x fan noise, battery life? \n\nI am thinking of buying the ThinkPad 5 Pro R7 6800HS or Yoga Slim 7 ProX R7 6800H or Zenbook Pro 17 R7 6800H, but I am not sure which one is the best choice :D",
  "Hi, sorry to bother you again, but I bought that laptop as well and I am facing an issue sometimes... when i close the lid and open it after a while, sometimes I can't wake it up. Have you encountered something like that?   \nSeems like a software issue to me, but I don't really want to reinstall it after I signed up into everything and so on :D",

  "Thermals are good since the wattages are low. It’s like 35W CPU and 55W GPU or something like that. Fan noise and surface temps are also good. Cooler and quieter than my brothers G14 but then again his laptop pumps way more wattage to the components.",
  "How about [Ideapad 5 Pro](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-500/ideapad-5-pro-gen-7-(14-inch-amd)/len101i0057) for $850 vs M1 Mac Air with (16+256) for $1,137 and a $150 gift card?\n\nI'm going to use it for my research tasks for example using three browsers and keeping at least 15 tabs in each of them open simultaneously and running one word processor that's it\n\nI can deal with external storage without any issues. What would be the actual battery backup of the 6600HS version? My primary requirement is longevity, that it should at least survive my multiple browser tabs for 5 to 6 years. I have been using one IdeaPad 330S 14\" by Lenovo with 8 GB of RAM and 512 SSD, with one TB hard drive and extremely poor battery life that is for 3.5 hours and I've been using it for a 3 year and 8 months. Do you think if I do not take Apple Care Plus then I should not be touching Mac and I would be better off with one Windows device?\n\nI don't use any Apple products. Fixing Apple with out of pocket is surely scary! But, I just can't find a Windows alternative with similar battery life. While Apple is asking significantly more money for less RAM and storage, but yes I understand that there are things beyond RAM & SSD for which they are doing it. I have been used to cheap Windows machines so much that I am pretty reluctant to pay 850 for a Windows machine. I am building this argument in my head that if I am going to pay above 850, then it shouldn't be a Windows machine. But, then comes the back and forth discussion on what are you getting for your money actually! It is frustrating! I still can't decide.",
  "Yes disable the smart face detection features. In Lenovo Vantage there’s a thing that will automatically sleep when you walk away and auto wake when you come back. It does this by looking from the IR camera. I found turning this off fixes the lid sleep wake issue.",
  "Got it, that’s what I meant sorry. How do you like the matte finish versus the newer shiny alternatives it looks a little retro but I guess it’s easier on the eyes.",
  "Great, thanks! And the battery life? In specs is usually around 9h, but I didn't find any review in English so...",
  "Battery life will be better on the mac and the 16GB RAM will go farther in MacOS than in Windows. The Pro 14 probably gets around 10 hours real world use depending on what you're doing but the M1 Air gets like 15 hours real world use.\n\nMacOS is more efficient with RAM and swap so a 16GB M1 Air will feel more like 24GB in Windows. That is the major downside to the Ideapad Pro line is the soldered RAM. I got 16GB soldered and I am fully aware of the RAM limitation in Windows, and I am fully prepared to run Linux in a few years if I need my RAM to be used more efficiently.\n\nHonestly the only reason I got the Ideapad Pro 16 over a Mac was 1. I like to game while I'm traveling and 2. I wanted a bigger screen. The only big laptop Apple offers is insanely expensive. I get like 80% of the experience for half the cost. But the Ideapad Pro 14 vs the MBA 13, you don't really lose much with the MBA in terms of screen real estate, but you gain so much in battery life and RAM utilization without paying twice as much.\n\nDo you live near a micro center? If so, check if they have any more of these refurb Ideapad Pro 14 in stock. This is a killer deal for $500 for almost the exact same laptop just with a 5600U from last year instead. https://www.microcenter.com/product/648423/lenovo-ideapad-5-pro-14-laptop-computer-refurbished-grey",
  "Great, thanks.\r  \n\r  \nI found these features very interesting, but it makes sense it causes problems. Turned them off, will see tomorrow. \r  \n\r  \nBut so far, great laptop for that price, only 32GB RAM could come handy sometimes. :D",

Even if I pay around $1140 (for M1 Air 16+256GB) i.e. $250 more (not counting the $150 gift card) than IdeaPad 5 Pro (16+1TB) it would be a good investment, right (even if I am not into the Apple ecosystem)? Again, my priorities are longevity, and good real world use. I am a grad student from literary background, so research and writing is what I do. No gaming or using intense softwares at all!\n\nI am scared to use any refurbished product unless it is a personal source or something like that.

If not for gaming, I too would enjoy an M1 Mac. My wife has one. Real world experience is just flawless.\n\nIf you are on a budget though and that micro center option is available I would go and check it out. It’s a Lenovo refurb so it’s from the factory, micro center is just the store front. MC has some of the greatest customer service in the world so if you’re at all interested just go in and ask them about it. Since it’s a factory refurb it likely has a warranty on it.",

  "After a while I have to say that it still doesn't work as It should.   \nI put it in sleep mode manualy from Windows start, close the lid and the next day I can't wake it up again - but It might be because it still drains battery and in Windows I see \"Screen on 11h\" as the battery drains almost 10%/hour even though it should be in sleep.   \nTried clean install but the issue still continues.\n\nIdk, I will prolly try to contact Lenovo if I won't fix it today, cause it might be hw issue... great.",

  "ASUS Zenbook 14 vs LENOVO IdeaPad 5i Pro 14\" for portability, research, and essays hi everyone!\n\ni'm in the market for a new laptop and these two are standing out to me, i'd love to hear some thoughts on which is the better option\n\n[https://www.currys.co.uk/products/asus-zenbook-14-um425qa-14-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-512-gb-ssd-grey-10240188.html](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/asus-zenbook-14-um425qa-14-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-512-gb-ssd-grey-10240188.html)\n\n[https://www.currys.co.uk/products/lenovo-ideapad-5i-pro-14-laptop-intel-core-i5-512-gb-ssd-grey-10239724.html](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/lenovo-ideapad-5i-pro-14-laptop-intel-core-i5-512-gb-ssd-grey-10239724.html)\n\nthe reasons for me needing a new laptop is that i'm starting a new in person college course and also a new online postgrad course. neither will require anything particularly intensive (mainly research and essay writing, a couple windows open and i also tend to be a bit tab heavy when browsing and researching). a big priority for me is portability as i need to be able to take the laptop with me places, as i'll be doing a lot of work on my break at work and also taking it into college, and even using it during commutes, meaning weight and battery life\n\ni understand that the lenovo has the better processor, and this is the main selling point for this laptop for me. however, the asus is lighter and what looks like much better battery life which in my use case i feel will be really important (though, some reviews seem to imply that the asus's usual battery life is actually more like 9 hours which closes the gap a lot). i've also found it harder to find reviews of the 14\" version of the lenovo and i think that's been making me a lean towards the asus as well as i've heard little in the way of feedback about how the lenovo is. but the 12th gen i5 does sound like a great processor that's hard to find much comparable at the sub 500 mark. i'd also love to hear some thoughts on heat management, durability, and screen quality for these models\n\ni do have some hobby based interests in photography but editing isn't a priority as i have a desktop set up at home\n\ni'd also like to ask as a bit of a secondary question, in whether people think that going for a 2 in 1 flex design would be worth it for my use case or is it more of a gimmick?\n\nthanks so much for reading and any help and advice you might be able to give me :)",

  "Ideapad 5 Pro with Ryzen 6600HS - Thoughts? I spotted the Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro (Part 82SJ0005US) sitting at $740 on Lenovo's website today, which feels like a pretty low price for a laptop with a Ryzen 6000 series CPU, 16GB RAM, and a 1 TB SSD. I'm curious about the 6600HS specifically since I can barely find any review of laptops that use it. Based on the higher TDP, I'd expect it to outperform the 6600U. Does anyone have experience with a laptop containing the 6600HS? I'd also be interested to know how the battery life is with a 35 W TDP chip. Thanks!",
  "It's amazing. The HS processor is only a level below the H processor and miles ahead of the U while still achieving great battery life.\nThe machine in question has a 75whr battery I guess, but I have a similar model and my battery lasts ages and doesn't even get noisy or heat up much when under heavy load.",
  "Hi, I’m considering the same one or the Intel one. Curious to hear thoughts.",
  "Ryzen H35 and Intel P28 are still branches of \"H-series\". These are CPUs targeted at professionals who do heavy-multi-threaded work, and who do not need super long battery life.\n\nYou will see a lot of tech reviewers mindlessly recommending laptops with these chips but they are not really made for casual users in mind.",
  "Yea this laptop looks great, and from the last gens performance this one should be pretty good, you should definetly look into it",
  "Did you end up buying this laptop? I'm currently considering this one over the Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro with 5825U CPU. I'm mostly interested if the 6600HS version will last a full 8 hour school day. Reasons to go for the 6600HS are the 660M GPU which will allow for some light gaming.",
  "I did buy this laptop and overall it's performing well, the 660M is a big step up from my previous device. In battery-saver mode I can get just about 8 hours of light browsing / note-taking, and I think there are more advanced ways that you can further decrease power usage.",

  "Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Pro 14\" QHD 400 nits (feedback requested) Oof, it is a long time since I bought a super expensive Dell Inspiron 5000 laptop. :) Cost the same as a used car back then, or about $5000. Even my boss thought it was expensive. The old Dell machine had a 15\" screen.\n\nI think I can follow the trend in technology but I thought I'd put this here and ask for feedback for this one particular type of laptop. Feel free to chime in.\n\nThe following is a smaller laptop, with a noticeable small'ish screen without a num keyboard. I don't need the num keyboard and so I would rather go with the lighter weight, than the other variant with a 16\" screen. I don't intend for this laptop to be used for any gaming, nor any serious work related stuff, so I don't think I really need a 16\" screen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Pro 14\" QHD 400 nits**\n\nAMD  Ryzen 7 6800HS-CE (8 cores, 3.2 GHz, 4.7 GHz turbo) (What does \"CE\" mean here?)\n\n16 GB  LPDDR5 SDRAM, 6400 MHz\n\n1 TB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 x4 - NVM Express (NVMe)\n\n14\" - IPS screen,  2880 x 1800 (2.8K), 16:10,  400 cd/m²,  Antirefleks, Low Blue Light-teknologi, 170°-synsvinkel, Eyesafe-teknologi, DC dimming. (Can't go wrong with an IPS screen I would think.)\n\nAMD Radeon 680M (Maybe a dedicated gfx card?) (Edit: Could be a gpu on the cpu die perhaps.)\n\n1080p camera (Edit: A German website states this being a 2Megapixel camera.)\n\nRealtek ALC3287 (So.. sound at least)\n\nKeyboard with backlighting (Nice, or, that sounds nice.)\n\nWifi and bluetooth\n\nBattery power, up to 16 hours it says with reduced screen brightness (Yes, I don't quite trust this)\n\nBattery power:  56.5 Wh\n\n2 + 1 +1  USB 3.2 ports (maybe 2 or 3 for utility, and 1 for power chord?)\n\nHDMI port\n\nmic and headset port (analogue)\n\n4 in 1 card reader (Nice)\n\nWeight 1.41 kg (not too bad)\n\nMin operating temperature: 5 deg C (lol, what?)\n\nDimensions:  31.22 cm (width) x 22.1 cm (depth) x 1.59 cm (height)\n\nKeyboard + touchpad\n\nAluminium chassis (But a reviewer says plastic framing on inside of screen).\n\nOS: Win 11 (well, not very important to me, choice of OS undecided, but can't ask for empty SSD.)\n\nSpeakers: Some on bottom I think, some on top side. Heh, imagine food and stuff clogging the top mesh for the speakers, might be hard to clean. I really ought to stop eating food in front of my keyboard. Edit: Review commenter claims speakers are bottom facing, but also \"sounds upwards\".\n\nLooks like lots of venting holes at the front underside (or maybe it was back side), which I guess means one shouldn't place the laptop on top of fabric, like in your bed, risking covering the vent openings.\n\nI know from before that, althought one guy on the internet might be complaining about bad build quality or flaws, that might not be representative of the product that most people have, still, when someone comment on what they think is a flimsy or noisy laptop as some other model I checked, that is no fun.\n\nEdit: A reviewer comments that his integrated graphics version of this laptop, had noticeable noise when compared to the version with dedicated Nvidia card on it.\n\nEdit: I deleted some previous comment of mine about a reviewer's video review online, about a supposed 1 year old issue with some unknown configuration that probably is fixed by now. Also little if no info online found on this.",
  "I learned today that the 'CE' designation for the cpu, means \"creator edition\". Presumably, this might mean better performing cpu, or possibly, hotter cpu due to it being better performing. Sry, I am no expert on cpus, so I am not sure what to think about that.",
  "im planning on buying this laptop too, i think the new ryzen is the beast considering the efficiency per wattage of AMD is far better than Intel now (6nm vs 10nm), radeon680 is using newest tech of AMD(rdna2) for integrated GPU and is better than Iris Xe if you want gaming. Battery i think average 5-6hrs usage, maybe more if u just playing video all the time.",
  "Some things I think I've learned:\n\n(Edit: Oops, looks like the default non Intel wifi card also has 6G and ax built in.)\n\n~~The wifi card is 5G only, or (ac) standard, not ax (6G).~~ ~~Though it sort of looks like you can buy the Intel ax-210 wifi card, and get the ax standard for as little as $30-40 or something like that. Presumably Windows 11 has the drivers ready in the OS for it, and presumably, the Intel card is already whitelisted, but I honestly don't understand this whitelisting of devices, maybe an old thing by now, unsure.~~\n\nNo idea what quality the 1080p webcam has, maybe 5 megapixels? Maybe not.\n\nI hope I can install a Linux distro later, but that might be a little troublesome if Lenovo only officially supports Linux for their ThinkPad line of laptops. Or, maybe there isn't much of a problem, very much unsure about all of that.\n\nOne review seem to claim that \"storm gray\" is a silver gray, but it really seems like \"storm gray\" is a darker gray, and that the lighter gray is called \"cloud gray\".\n\nThere seem to be software for efficiently controlling the TDP limits with Ryzen cpu's, found at this website called 'AATU'. This should help lower any heat issue with boosts, to also reduce fan noise I think. A reviewer set the option to 1 sec, so the setting not only loads on boot, but is set every second to ensure the TDP limits are forced onto the cpu properly for the entire duration of your work session.\n\n[https://amdaputuningutility.com](https://amdaputuningutility.com) (Presumaly a legit website, but ofc one shouldn't blindly install software so maybe do some checks on this first.)\n\nThe 1080p camera, apparently has a privacy shutter which is nice. Then there is an infrared camera as well, which may or may not also be hidden behind the same cover.\n\nThe fingerprint sensor can be physically disconnected from the motherboard appartently. Unsure if that messes up anything in the OS. Unsure if that also disconnected the on/off button.\n\nI think I read that you can program the laptop to boot up, when you open the lid, and vice versa. Unsure if that requires the infrared camera to work or not.\n\nOnly iffy thing so far, might imo be the trackpad, which is said to be so so.\n\nI think I will be very happy with this choice overall, although there will never be any 32 GB ram upgrade.\n\nIt looks like you can easily fix your own laptop with authentic spare parts, which seems nice, and not too difficult. However, the keyboard is fused with the top side, and so, the entire (and presumalby non-metal) top side around the keyboard, has to be replaced, but might not be purchasable, but I guess you can ask their support perahaps for such a sparepart possibly.\n\nFor longevity of the battery, I think you have to rely on some Lenovo software that only charges the battery up to 80%, iirc, which seems like similar to some electric cars that by default charge just to 90%, to avoid premature wear on the battery.\n\nSadly, the usb ports only offer max 5 Gbps transfer rate, or less than 1GB per second  (probably much less) I think. The more advanced standard would have been the double transfer rate, 10 Gbps.\n\nLastly, there is afaik a very recent BIOS update, dated 2023 found on Lenovos website for the 14ARH7 variant which I think this configuration of Lenovo Ideapad 5 pro 14\" is called (unsure).",
  "and look at that 6400mhz ram, crazy.",
  "I think I might also replace the possibly OEM M.2 device with a 1 TB Samsung 980 pro one. I can keep the one with Win 11, whenever I need to update bios and such.\n\nI am pleasantly surprised by the seemingly nice screen resolution options on modern laptops like this one. Normally high res (2K) equate to tiny, OS icons, but there should be ways to scale those back up.\n\nGlad I don't have to look at another TN screen ever again. I had one with this greenish tint to it. :)  Not a laptop, but an old Eizo screen, a cheaper one.",

The next jump is at $1300 for a new swift go 14\" 155H rtx 4050.\n\nhere's a quick useful video review about it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3I3q48674&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3I3q48674&t=180s)\n\nmajor notes:\n\n* **the version with the OLED screen does not have touch input.** I found this out the hard way. :( I guess i assumed that the swift's \"go\" series was like \"flipbook\" and \"spin\", in that the touch-screen is it's main feature, without the flipping/spinning part. I was wrong. (the 155H version has touch-screen: [SFG14-72T-71QF](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72t-71qf) along with a 16\" version. Look for the icon with a finger pointing.)\n\nmajor cons:\n\n* the battery life is lower compared to other ultrabooks, maybe 6-10 hours vs 10-14 hours zenbook, perhaps due to the 65w vs 75w battery(?). I can't say yet, and maybe windows (and it's bloatware) is still doing something, but i got 10 hours on my first three charges, draining at \\~10%/hour; But i also always use minimum brightness, and just had the normal 30 tabs open (edge, most tabs sleeping) with music playing. Conversely, perhaps because it has a smaller battery, it charges very very quickly: an hour or so (with the given charger). It's also nice that usb-c was standardized for charging, though i wished the usb-c cable would detach from the power block... A minor gripe. After the first few drains, i've kept the laptop charged, and used some pre-installed Acer program to limit charging when plugged-in (to 80%, no choice). This really is it's only major con.\n* the OLED is glossy. so glossy you can see a deep, deep, and rich reflection of yourself. It's like looking into a dark mass of water. It raises self-awareness and horror :cold\\_face:\n\nproblems likely similar to other ultrabooks, and other notes:\n\n* fan noise, and heat. when it speeds up, it's clearly audible in a quiet bedroom when it starts up. it can start with very little computering ([the zenbook got panned in a review for being worse](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Zenbook-14-OLED-review-The-1-2-kg-subnotebook-with-120-Hz-OLED-and-Core-Ultra-7.805236.0.html)), then it goes back to silent mode, and thankfully, *stays* silent. And when it's silent, it's *absolutely* silent! It's apparently not louder than it's competitors tho?? sounds fine to me... *Thank goodness!* Along with fan noise, it can get a little warm at the palms. I think this happened during the beginning of it charging. Thankfully, the aluminum(?) case ensures it cools down quickly, and keeps it cool. (this is my portable-desktop-laptop, wherein i plan to use a separate mechanical keyboard most of the time anyway). However, when it's not charging, it seems to stay quiet 'n cool, which is the most important time.\n* the speakers are bass-less, but the amp is surprisingly incredible(!!).. but then again, i've never heard good laptop speakers in my life. Zero bass, which i'm okay with, as i'm a dreamy-pop treble music person, but just say no to lo-fi/city-pop. It's interesting to hear bass guitars without the bass.. It reminds me of my old purple 'n gold ATH-AD700 headphones that i adore, but far worse mixing. The audio goes through some artificial spatial surround sound software: the mids seem to live recessed in the bottom center of the laptop (vocals), then are overtly forwarded to every direction / speaker in the artificial speaker system (piano), the highs are all over the place, moving from one part of the laptop to another; and the lows remind me of bad midi music. Your favorite music will *not* move you. You will however listen to your favorite music in a very different way.. Having said that, the speakers can get very loud, easily able to fill up a room(!!), and most importantly: beyerdynamic 300r 32ohm headphones sound great at a mere 10% volume!\n* the up and down arrow keys share a single key area. I use wasd for gaming, so it doesn't bother me. This also keeps the keyboard's shape to a neat rectangle.\n* the left modifier keys aren't big. they're the same size as the letter 'n number keys. The right modifier keys, however, are slightly wider. They had to do this to make space for the function key. UPDATE: i re-mapped/swapped left-control with left-alt, mac-style. much better. i'll likely re-map holding caps-lock to left-control too.\n* the keys feel only slightly better than my $40 samsung chromebook 4, which, now that i'm looking at it, surprisingly, has the big fat left modifier keys and complete arrow keys too! Not bad, that thing! (for programmers the tilde key and delete keys are nice to have, and nicely placed, as are the half-size function/special keys... tho, i'm scared of what bloatware the acer key will manifest..!) UPDATE: in retrospect, it's actually a great keyboard. I ordered a keychron k6, and those red keys are god awful. Seriously, who want's to press a key down for a one-half inch?? I've become used to the tiny distance of laptop keyboards..\n* the 14\" screen is a huge surprise coming from an 11.6\" chromebook (2.4\" is a lot!) and even the 13.3\" macbook, yet it's dimensions are only very slightly larger (<1\"). There's about an inch of empty space on both sides of the keyboard--I'm the sort of person who saw the 15\" Macbook and thought, *\"ugh, what is all that space for!?\"*, and didn't buy one until the 13\" came out. The massive OLED screen gets as close as you'd want to the edges--any closer, your fingerprints would smudge the beautiful screen when opening/closing it. As does the massive trackpad.\n* the bigger touchpad may cause more accidents. I haven't had enough experience, but thus far, it seems fine for my hands, for the most part. I did have had it click on random parts of this review i'm writing quite a few times.. but then again, i'm currently sitting at a bad angle. UPDATE: i love it. bigger is better. i must have gotten used to it, as i don't accidentally touch it anymore..\n* the ports are perfect for me, as i'm not updated on current technology: two thunderbolt(?, new to me), two usb--one on each side!!!, one hmdi, a headphone jack, an sd card reader, and a good ol' kensington lock, lol. I've never used a lock before, but have always found it intriguing . I feel the port choices are very old-school, like me. :) It might be possible for 4 displays for this chip...!? (note: smaller 13.3\" laptops can compromise on ports)\n* bloatware. after 20 years, this still exists. Why? McAfee still exists..?? I did however use the 1 year of 100GB dropbox. Could someone please ship me a usb flash drive or sd card so that i can re-install windows? ;(\n\nwith all the similar \"ultrabooks\" (Asus zenbook, Lenovo yoga, HP spectre, Dell xps 14, maybe even the lower-end Acer spin, Asus flipbook, Asus vivobook, HP pavilion plus, Dell inspiron plus, 'n so on), i felt it's pretty hard to decide on one, and just went with what good deals i found on eBay, and checked the review on notebookcheck, and double-checked that the specs are indeed \"ultra\" (weight, size, build quality--not plastic).\n\nit's direct local (to Taiwan) competition is the asus zenbook, and i actually think that's a better notebook. Better speakers, better keyboard (i prefer big keys over the macbook chiclet-style), betters looks (premium business ultrabook vs macbook clone), lighter (an insane 1.3kg), and most importantly a better battery (75w vs 65w, 12+ hours vs 8 in tests!), but, notebookcheck's review noted a fan noise problem, due to it having a single fan / heat-sink vs this Acer's double fan 'n heat-sink. The problem could just be a fluke, but def worth researching other users experiences about it. Beyond that single problem though, i def prefer the zenbook. However, if a macbook clone is what you're really into, this Acer is just that!: a 14\" Macbook Pro (possibly for half the price due to bad resale value)\n\ni personally chose the Intel ultra series for it's great games/power balance, and x64 architecture. I missed out on the entire AMD marathon. An older asus rog flow x13 (g14 doesn't have touch-screen), razer blade 14, or microsoft surface pro (intel ultra series, not the newer ARM arch models) would have been my top choices, if i were to accept something more used. The previous gen surfaces were way too expensive! But i'm super stoked with what i got for $550. Wow! Also, i love Taiwan (made in Taiwan <3), so Acer 'n Asus were actually my top choices (they do all the hard work of making everything, and are absolutely lovely people with an incredible culture to behold, so let them have all my monies!). Actually, i've been fond of the swift series laptops, particularly swift 3 series and 5 series, ever since that time i went to a physical store to test 'n compare laptops. They were by far the best deals in the \"budget\" range. They were all ultrabooks in my eyes, for a fraction of the price of one.\n\nthe OLED is stunning. Now there's absolutely no need for a Macbook for me. My last one was a late-201313\" MBP. Hello again, Windows. How i've missed you dearly. And oh my, how you've accepted Linux..?? I don't even need Linux anymore, and that's coming from Arch! Also, having done some programming, i can't justify the sufferings that Apple has made programmers go through over its reign. Microsoft has since made a big turn towards accepting open-source, linux, programmers, etc. Strange, but good... i hope.\n\nfor my personal needs, the lower-resolution IPS touch-screen would've been ideal, for both touch input and possibly better gaming performance (*does native resolution matter nowadays..?*). It is indeed a major bummer. However, i feel that without the the ability to swivel the screen around (\"convertible\"), it would've made an odd touch-screen experience anyway, quite different from tablets. Also very important to note, **there's quite a few touch-screen OLED notebooks--**[**including the zenbook**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/13wdvxm/oled_touchscreen_is_awful/)**--, that suffer from a grainy screen problem**--though, i don't know which exact models / year have this problem. So, in the end, i feel it was more of a blessing. Anyway, i'm hoping my next job will pay for a premium laptop. At the moment, if money were not a factor, i'd go for either the Asus rog flow x13 or dreamy z13. The z13 is all i've ever dreamed for, ever since the iPad came out. ;) ...but i've read that even the z13 suffers from a very low battery life. :/\n\nUPDATE: now that i've got OLED, i can't imagine ever going back.. o.o\n\nso, if i were to choose again, a \"new\" 2022 asus rog flow x13 ryzen 7940HS would have been my choice, and very very surprisingly, it's going for a mere \\~$800!! So, unless you find a deal like mine, you should just go for one of the best out there! Otherwise, this is an incredibly solid laptop for its price. It has also easily convinced me macbooks aren't worth it anymore, as it was a decade ago, even considering the newer ARM M-series. I'm a believer of Acer/Asus/Taiwan!",
  "Is the fan noise not that big of a deal? I plan to buy this same model, and will be using this inside my university's computer laboratory. And I don't want to distract others with the fan noise.",
  "I bought my Acer Swift Go 14 on September 28, featuring an Ultra 5 125H processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and a 90Hz OLED HDR display running Windows 11 (23H2). I got it for 60,000 INR after discounts, down from around 80K. My previous laptop was the ASUS FX504, which I used for 6 years.\n\n# Negatives:\n\n* Wi-Fi Speeds & Performance: The ASUS consistently outperforms the Acer in download speeds, and I occasionally feel a static sensation when touching the metal surface while charging.\n* Sharp Trackpad Edge & Heat During Charging: The trackpad edge is uncomfortable, and the right side gets hot while charging, making it tough to use on my lap.\n* Useless Copilot Key & Keyboard Backlight: I remapped the Copilot key to Ctrl using AutoHotKey, but the keyboard backlight turns off too quickly, which is frustrating.\n* AI Features & Webcam: The AI eye contact feature is poorly executed, and the wide-angle webcam captures too much of my surroundings.\n* Glossy Display: It's highly reflective, which isn't ideal for bright environments.\n\n# Positives:\n\n* Stunning Design & Trackpad: The laptop looks sleek, almost like a MacBook, and the massive trackpad is so good that I hardly use a mouse.\n* Solid Hinge & Great Keyboard: The hinge is easy to open with one hand and feels premium, while the keyboard is clicky and visually appealing.\n* Outstanding Display: It's bright and colorful, with excellent HDR for movies.\n* Useful AI Features & Decent Speakers: The AI background blurring and noise cancellation work well, and the speakers are good for a laptop.\n* Convenient Charging & Good I/O: I can use my phone's USB-C charger, and there are multiple USB ports and useful features.\n\n# Performance:\n\nWhile I haven't tested it with games or benchmarks yet, the Acer is significantly faster than my ASUS for everyday tasks. It handles multiple apps smoothly, even on battery.\n\n# Battery Life:\n\nYou can't expect stellar battery life with a high-resolution H-series processor. I got around 5 hours of SOT with regular use and 4 hours while looping a 4K movie. There are ways to extend battery life, but I prefer using it to its full potential since it stays on my desk most of the time.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nFor the price I paid, I believe I found the best laptop for my needs. I'm very satisfied overall. **For the full review, check out my post** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcerOfficial/comments/1g75rhv/new_acer_swift_go_14_ai_pcs_review/).

You’d have to research into Mac’s emulation. I would hope the x64 emulation is good, as it takes time to transition cpu architectures.. I personally just wouldn’t want to bother with all of this, so it better be dang good! The intel Macs was a good time imo, having Mac and windows run natively via boot camp. ARM, i have no idea.

Forcing people to buy a Mac product just to deploy to it is insane to me (though surely there’s a service for that now..).

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Help me choose a laptop for uni I don’t know which one to pick among these three laptops. I’m studying business while also working in content and graphic design, mostly 2D. The software I often use includes Microsoft Office, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, CapCut, Filmora, and Premiere.\n\nIf possible, I’d really appreciate it if you could recommend some ultrabooks or lightweight laptops under 15 inches. My budget is around $1000.",
  "Thinkbook, stay away from ideapads.",
  "How come? I don’t really know much about laptops, ppl said its a good deal",
  "Ideapads have generally terrible build quality and break after a year or two. Thinkbooks are built for small-medium sized business owners and are meant to last long.",
  "Tks. Appreciate that",
  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget €2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years. As longevity is important, I believe performance is an important criteria. My current setup is an 8th gen Intel i5 Asus laptop (8/256) and a M4 Mac Mini (24/512) on the desk. I want to replace both of these items with a single Windows laptop and I'll sell the Mac. I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around €2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. €1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. €1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. €1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. €2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. €2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** €2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",
  "Have you ruled out Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024 or 2025)? It is a cheaper Asus ProArt with the same of internals.  These Asus model carry the best speakers of all Windows laptops which is nice to have if you have kids or others to share a screen.",
  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",
  "Question: why are you listing high refresh rate laptops? Is that something you want?\n\nBecause I doubt you’ll max out that refresh rate in games unless you play older games or competitive online games.\n\nEdit: nvm just saw you don’t care about games.",
  "Have you considered a HP ZBook?",
  "T14 Thinkpads",
  "Update: Added the Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) to the list",

  "I have last year's IdeaPad 5 pro. I'm pretty happy with it. I think the one you are looking at is a good deal at that price. It has an OLED screen which is a nice upgrade. And a metallic case.

  "Not good. There’s a Lenovo LOQ 15 with an i5-12450HZ and a 4060 for £799.99 on Amazon right now. Waaaaay better than the 3050. There’s also another model (shopping at Lenovo directly) with the same CPU but a 4050 at £668.80. Go to https://gaminglaptop.deals and select United Kingdom to see more deals like those. A 3050 Laptop in 2024 is not a good investment",

  "Yeah seems a bit too good to be true 🤣, I can pay it over 18 months without interest so that’s helpful as far as budget goes. I watched a review and it seems that it’ll even work for my light gaming as someone was pulling around 50-70 fps on both Baldurs gate and ghost of Tsushima. I was expecting much worse so that’s pretty decent.",

  "Please help!!! I may or may not go insane without your help ;) First, let me just say, until this I was totally and completely computer/electronic dumb. Well, I still am but now I know things, kinda. I have done so much research, and price and review comparison that I am now crosseyed and my brain is mush. I REALLY need all you IT/computer geniuses help. I've been at this for way to long.\n\nSo, My Dell inspiron 15 3000 10th gen i5 just suddenly stopped working 30 min before my 2nd round interview with a telehealth company (the charging port is messed up, I think? No issues of this variety previously and deleted most everything on it so my son could use it since I wasn't). I have always had problems with it being unbearably slow and not loading stuff. More than a few times I have almost tested it to see how far it could fly when thrown from a 2nd story window. So I am needing a new one. I need something fast that I can run EMR programs when traveling and working from hotels or motocross tracks on occasion (The companies usually provide my equipment for home) and I need something I can edit photos and video, do spreadsheets and bookkeeping and I am that person that constantly has 100 tabs open at all times, ok that's an exaggeration, currently I only have 10 google pages and 4 programs open, but I have only been on my desktop for a few hours, I will definitely have more open shortly, no need to worry, haha.\n\nAnyway, from what I've read for remote healthcare work I need MINIMUM 16GB 512GB SSD and an i5 to run the programs efficiently, but an i7 or Ultra i7 is prefered, and need a webcam and good speakers/microphone. I have to have the number pad but am more than ok using a normal keyboard if needed and I will use an actual mouse so the touchpad sensitivity or whatever isn't a consideration. The sites i looked at for best laptops for medical workers never mentioned the AMD Ryzen, but I am not sure how old they were. Their #1 pick was either a macbook or surface pro, but I work in healthcare so I can't afford those and I am not an apple user/fan, but I could consider one if its best.\n\nAfter hours and hours and even more hours I thought I had it narrowed down to a Lenovo ideapad or an Asus Vivobook S with Ultra i7. When I went to buy the Asus the price went back up to over $750 (was on sale for $638) and so I did even more comparison shopping/research and I just can't get over the people saying the Asus's are junk. So I am leaning back towards a lenovo. I would rather have a thinkpad or x1 Carbon but I think I would have to get refurbished. I have a thinkcentre desktop that was refurbished and it has been awesome aside from a glitch here and there (it was $200 so expected to have an issue or 2), but I have had horrible luck with refurbished laptops, so it makes me nervous. Then my son who is preparing for college for coding and programing tells me that every Lenovo he's used has been junk (school provided laptops) and that HP has really gone down hill and aren't like they used to be, but Asus are good gaming laptops and that the AMD are pretty good depending on the generation and specs. He is also a know it all 18yr old but he's a smart lil s#!t, so I listen sometimes, only on occasion. Now though I don't know what is good, what will work for my needs and what I should flat out ignore.\n\nNow here's the kicker....drum roll..... I absolutely cannot spend over $800. Preferably between $500-$700. I have the jist of what to look for but I start going brain dead when comparing SDRAM vs DRAM, graphics and 802.11ax vs Infrared. Ummmm.... yep, one of those is what I need, I think.....\n\nPlease PLEASE help me. I have another interview via Teams on Friday and no laptop and no webcam. I am ok with replacing in a few years but would like it to at least last 5 years, and without a lot of decline in performance. I have tried so hard to find the best laptop to replace my Dell and my desktop with my budget on my own but I can't find a lot on the AMD ryzen aside from it seems to have less cores/threads and I don't know which brand is good anymore. Oh and I also have caviar taste on a top ramen budget, so there is also that. I am a 40 year old mom whos never needed a computer for more than school.\n\nSorry for the word vomit, just wanted to make sure I included as much info as possible. Thank you for your help. It is really truly appreciated.",

  "no problem, it's just 1 search away lol",
  "For most people ya. For me? 18278398 searches, asking business teachers, college computer nerds and a father in law who is building AI for a major port on the west coast and self taught himself coding which he now teaches at a community college, away before I finally came here. When your poor with expensive tastes and ADHD and OCD, its just not that simple. I have to make sure I am getting the absolute best I can for the money, and that its not cheaper or have better deal somewhere else. It just took us 6mths to buy a used work car under 10K. I have issues, lol. I knew all the minimum specs I needed and knew somethings where more important than others. What was making me lose my mind was Brand and AMD Ryzen or Ultra i-- or just i---. One website says Dell with a Ryzen 7 the next say their POS get a Asus Ultra 7. So ya its just not that easy for weirdos like me. The Ryzen thing was really throwing me off. The rtings site help because it listed all the major laptops for that range and how it rated in each category. I understand charts, lists, and numbers. Data. Reading through reviews and opinion I spiral and will make buying a pair of shoes seem like the biggest investment of my life.",

  "This is used, ask the seller if they ship to India and if not, you can use a freight forwarder like MyUS if the seller allows it:\n\n[https://www.ebay.com/itm/256810297126](https://www.ebay.com/itm/256810297126)\n\nThough it is used, it is open-box and is under your budget whilst ticking all of your boxes, iGPU from the CPU should be enough for running multiple windows of VSCode and other coding applications and power efficient enough for a decent battery life.\n\nComes with a 3K OLED 120Hz screen, can lower to 1080p for coding and for the occasional gaming and 3K for content consumption (it is NOT a gaming laptop but the iGPU should be powerful enough for [light 1080p gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs0tPnmkIVg) and more than enough for schoolwork).\n\nAlso comes with 24GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, which should be sufficient for coding workloads and files too.\n\nThe price in Rupees is 77,679.03INR as of writing, the 23k leeway should be enough to cover shipping to India.\n\nIf you want the best bang-for-buck, used is the best way to go, and eBay has very good buyer protection in case anything goes wrong. I recommend if you do buy the laptop to record your unboxing and testing of the laptop upon unboxing as evidence in case there are issues with the laptop.\n\nAlso, I would recommend spending your extra budget on thermal pads (PTM 7950 is tried and tested) for your CPU for better thermals and slightly better battery life (lower temps), and reinstalling Windows 11 once you receive the laptop to get rid of bloatware.\n\nLastly, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts) to activate your fresh W11 copy without buying a key (you can check it's legitimacy, I used it myself to activate Windows on both my PC and laptop).\n\nHope this helps!\n\nP.S. If by the time you check the laptop is unavailable, just look for other Vivobook or Zenbook laptops on eBay that are 14\" with a Ryzen AI 9 x CPU since the iGPU on this chip is good for price-to-performance.",

At first glance it's fine, but for and IDE like CLION with 2 google tabs opened it won't last very long. Also, it's very RAM intensive, alongside MATLAB and Simulink.  \nSo basically I need battery, RAM and even tough I don't game on my laptop I want a decent graphics card so I can game dev (Unreal, Unity) and I also looked up on google that a graphics card helps with AI. (I will study AI next year)\n\nI thought about 3 options, 2 of them being a little overbudget but I can make it work.\n\n[Option1: Lenovo LOQ](https://www.pcgarage.ro/notebook-laptop/lenovo/gaming-156-loq-15irx9-fhd-ips-144hz-procesor-intel-core-i7-13650hx-24m-cache-up-to-490-ghz-24gb-ddr5-1tb-ssd-geforce-rtx-4050-6gb-no-os-luna-grey/)\n\n[Option2: Lenovo IdeaPad](https://www.pcgarage.ro/notebook-laptop/lenovo/16-ideapad-pro-5-16ahp9-25k-ips-120hz-procesor-amd-ryzen-7-8845hs-16m-cache-up-to-51-ghz-32gb-ddr5x-1tb-ssd-geforce-rtx-4050-6gb-no-os-arctic-grey/)\n\n[Option3: Asus TUF](https://www.pcgarage.ro/notebook-laptop/asus/gaming-156-tuf-f15-fx507vu-fhd-144hz-procesor-intel-core-i7-13620h-24m-cache-up-to-490-ghz-16gb-ddr5-1tb-ssd-geforce-rtx-4050-6gb-no-os-mecha-gray-3/)\n\nThe Lenovo LOQ and the ASUS TUF, as you know, come in different variants, so feel free to suggest other variants or other laptops as well.  \nMy main concerns about these 3 are:\n\n\\- Will 16 GB RAM in the ASUS TUF suffice for college work?  \n(+ this one is upgradable but I don't really think it's worth it)\n\n\\-Is 32 GB RAM too much or does it justify the price diff?\n\n\\- Will the battery on the Lenovo LOQ last me long enough?  \n(My goal is for at least 3 hours, but let me know if I am unrealistic)\n\n\\- Is the difference between The intel core i7-13 and the Ryzen 7 7435 that big to justify for the price diff?\n\n\\- Do I really need 1Terra storage?

  "Need a system for productivity, VM work, and light gaming with good battery I get into a lot of network simulation like GNS3 and EveNG to run network devices and systems VMs. I also am taking some online ethical hacking courses that uses a lot of VMs for Linux and windows. I don’t like staying plugged in all the time, so I’m trying to find a good mix.\n\nLast year i bought the Yoga Slim 9i 16” and it was fantastic except the battery. That was a joke. It would die with casual use within 2-3 hours or less, and that was with me turning down settings and going to 60hz. If that’s how it needs to be used, what’s the point of all the extra power and features? So I sold it. My 15” MacBook Air M2 has been working out for productivity, but I really need a Windows system back for my VM and simulation stuff. I also miss gaming a little here and there. \n\nI am just not sure what will end up being more important to me feature wise (screen, weight, battery, dGPU etc). I am looking at three systems and leaning towards AMD for battery life, but the Core Ultra 9 185h has more cores for VM work and seems to do ok on battery depending on the system. I also love a good screen, but I don’t do a lot of media consumption really. I don’t know I will actually take advantage of miniLED/OLED or not.\n\nThree systems:\nLenovo Yoga Pro 9 w/o miniLED 32Gb, Intel 185H, 4050 (IPS version is on sale for 1299 at Best Buy. The miniLED version is $600 more because it isn’t on sale, and that’s too much extra)\nLenovo Thinkpad P16s Gen 2 w/ 7840u, 64gb ram, 1tb SSD, 4k OLED 60hz New in Box for $910 (AMD does ok casual gaming, so no dGPU is ok but I kinda prefer one)\nLenovo Ideapad Pro 5 w/ Intel Ultra 9 185H, 32Gb ram, 4050, 2k OLED 120hz refurbished for $850. (Has mixed reviews and a loud track which can annoy me)\n\nI am also trying to stick to under $1500.\n\nIf anybody else knows of something, my needs are:\n16” Nice screen w/ higher resolution (doesn’t have to be 4k) don’t care about high refresh rate on laptops. I’ve had it, and it didn’t much for me.\n32-64GB of ram (VMs take up a lot of ram)\nMany CORES (Ultra 9 has more than 8840U or HS, but not sure how much that will impact VM use)\nGood battery life without having to make it feel like a $300 laptop in features.\nNumberpad - Inputting IP address on a top row of keys is horrible. I have to do that some when i work remote for my job since my work laptop is 14”\n\nThere are a ton of options that fit all of this except battery life. It sucks to constantly worry about plugging in to keep working. I wanted the new Ryzen Ai 370 but there are no systems that meet my criteria except one new MSi system that is priced too high for the specs. I wish I didn’t want the numpad, but I really need it.\n",

  "Confused about which laptop to buy Hi everyone\n\nI am an engineering grad student and I want to buy a windows laptop for my work ( mostly ). but I keep getting more confused about which laptop to buy. My first choice was the Asus Zenbook 14, which I read multiple negative reviews of it's bad performance and some motherboard issues. My other candidate was some Lenovo Thinkpad Carbon( which is expensive ) Thinkpad P or T series, or Yoga 7i, which I read they also have some quality issues as the are made in China ( I just read the reviews, I never had a lenovo before). Then I found HP x360 2024 amazing due to its portability and use of newest gen of Intel chip, and guess what? when I searched its name, there was an essay of why these specific HP laptops are bad and have issues ( the post was from someone who claimed to be a former HP tech guy).\n\nIn conclusion, I want to buy a Laptop which is \n\n1. portable ( I have to carry it around everywhere, so the charger brick's weight also counts)\n2. Have good performance ( I use softwares for rendering and calculation, like heavy matlab tasks), so the RAM is also important. ( having the option to upgrade the device would be great )\n3. I am a bit concerned about the PWM of displays and it made me hesitate about buying an OLED panel )\n4. The battery life is also a thing, but not as important as the fan noise ( imagine being in a meeting and your laptop is louder than your supervisor )\n5. I have zero to no knowledge about the integrated graphics, but I heard the for an OLED panel its better to have a dedicated graphics. also for rendering I think dedicated graphics are better as you can assign a task to specific GPU core.\n\nRight now I am using an old Asus ROG from 6 years ago, and Its finally the time for retiring the old soldier.\n\nMy candidates for laptops are as mentioned:\n\n1. HP specter x360 (2024)\n2. Ideapad pro 5i\n3. Asus Zenbook 14 or 14pro\n4. Lenovo Yoga 7i (2024)\n5. Asus Zypherus g14 (2024 or 2023, I still don't know)\n6. Asus Vivobook ( not really sure about the build quality of them )\n\nPlease let me know if I missed any good laptops. Thank you in advance for your time. I am looking forward to reading your helpful comments.\n\nBest of luck!",
  "Choosing between Regular Laptop and Laptop with dedicated GPU - Is the fan noise too much for a classroom? I'm a student looking for a laptop under in the budget range $500-900 for coding, classes and everyday use. I don't play games, but an NVIDIA GPU would help me with CUDA programming. Currently, I rely on my university's cluster, which makes debugging a bit cumbersome. \n\nI had initially chosen the [Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-500/ideapad-pro-5i-gen-8-16-inch-intel/83aq000qus) since it fits my budget and doesn't look like a bulky gaming laptop. \n\nHowever, I've come across many comments and reviews that any laptop with a dedicated GPU can be noisy, have poor battery life, get too hot to touch, and so on. \n\nI hope you guys could answer these questions:\n\n* Do these issues still apply even if I'm not using the GPU and have the computer on a light load?\n* Would the laptop noisy enough that I would not be able to use it in classes without disturbing others?\n* I also have 4 hours of classes on some days and want a minimum battery life of 5 hours. The laptop has a 75Wh battery, how well does that translate to battery life?\n* Is there a way to switch off features that are not being used to reduce these issues?\n* Are there other issues with laptops with dedicated GPU's that I don't know about?\n\nI'm wondering if these potential downsides would outweigh the convenience of having an onboard NVIDIA GPU, and whether I'd be better off getting a regular laptop and continue using the university clusters instead.

Use the toothbrush to clean the tops of the keys, and in between the keys as best you can. \n\nTo get underneath the keys, you may be able to GENTLY tug on them and lift them from their hinges. Be careful not to snap or break anything, as you'd have a whole new set of problems.

It's not necessarily HARD but let me guide you through the broad strokes.   \n\n\nFirst - turn the fucking thing off and get the bottom off, disconnect the battery ASAP. Not joking. Get it off power asap as any conductive liquids are burning up traces and causing rapid oxidation of everything in there.   \n\n\nGo to ifixit, find your model, and start disassembling. Make sure you have the correct drivers to get all of the various screws out.   \n\n\nTake pictures of your progress if you've never disassembled something. Having a magnetic pad to place the screws on and label them is a godsend for this kind of thing.   \n\n\nAnticipate replacing the \"top plate w/keys\". That's the part you're looking for there. Try and find one that's in good shape on ebay or another site like that.   \n\n\nVisually inspect EVERYTHING for foreign objects, oxidation, substances. This is important as you don't want to have to do this all over again.   \n\n\nThere are a TON of resources out there for this kinda thing - but don't count on that keyboard working/feeling/smelling right ever again. If it got into the keys there's a good chance there's a plastic/poly layer between the keys and the mobo, let's hope (there seems to be in most that I've worked on).   \n\n\nSource: I fixed shit like this for a few decades and brought all SORTS of stuff back to life by being patient and meticulous.",

She’s tried “everything” except throwing away all the trash, ridding of books that haven’t seen the light of day in YEARS (she’s a teacher so she “needs all of the books she has” but probably has hundreds of thousands of books laying around, all of which getting more and more caked in roach gross over the years), she hasn’t ever tried bringing in a pro cleaner; not that I want to subject anybody to that hellscape, but she has horrible asthma and other disabilities that prevent her from cleaning in that house for long, the house gave me chronic bronchitis and I also have a muscle related condition (muscle spasms, joints buckling under normal weight, dislocations, subluxations, easy to accidentally overstrain a muscle doing nothing) that prevents me from working there long as well, my dad is a disabled military vet and my 2 youngest sisters have dropped out of school to be chronically online Roblox/Minecraft/genshin assholes who can’t even be bothered to wash their own dishes. My brother is the cleanest one of them, I’ve never seen his room unclean. All of us who have lived in that house for years have been sick for years. So over the last nearly 15 years it’s just gotten worse and worse and worse over there with no help and no light at the end of the tunnel. Oh did I mention she has 11 cats and 1 dog and 1 puppy? 3 of the cats are mine and I’m rescuing them from her soon, but I can’t take them all and I can’t call animal control because she has threatened to blackmail me if I do, telling me she knows she is doing wrong. To get AC to take it seriously I’d need to tell them details only I’d know and my mom has threatened me, my friends and friends family with blackmail should anybody report her. She has also been lying to the county school district and has been submitting fake school work in my sisters name to keep her “homeschool” status clear but my sister (dropped out 9th grade would be 11th grade now) doesn’t do the work. 90% of the time it’s my mom using some of her students work and editing my sisters name on it. My sister gets to do jack all and has to watch a Kahn academy video like once a month when my mom remembers to tell her to. I know this because I also dropped out (but did it right and got into alt school within a couple of months) and she tried to do it to me and I said hell no I’m not letting you do that I’ll do my own work. My sister desperately needs therapy because she has such bad anxiety she refuses to leave the house because she is afraid everybody is looking at her and judging her or making fun of her. That’s why she stopped going to school too, because she for some reason was always late to class and when she was late to class everyone would turn and look at her when she walked in. It’s horrible but my mom coddles her and tells her it’s ok and “she’ll figure it out.” Terrible really. It really is the upper middle class-holes that live like this….(not all of em ofc but ya get the point)\n\nMy sisters once broke both of their laptops by dropping them. My mom tried to take it to geek squad, but I said no there is probably roaches inside so lemme look cuz I’m a little tech savvy. Turns out they didn’t break them but actually there was so many roaches in it that the fan couldn’t turn so they were overheating, they both just happened to had dropped theirs recent to that and thought they broke it. It’s horrible how unfortunately normal all this crap is. Also can definitely say I will forever know if someone has roaches because the smell is excruciatingly distinct and makes me sick.",

Trash that's been piling up for months, with bugs everywhere.  So many dishes piled up that you can't even tell where the sink is, despite a dishwasher being right there.  Dirty laundry...EVERYWHERE.  Furniture cloth looks like a civil war bandage.  Carpet that looks like it hasn't been cleaned since the Nixon administration, despite the house only being 5 years old.  \n\nYou can smell the BO on these people from 20 feet away, like they haven't seen the wet end of a bathroom in years, and the smell lingers in your own clothes after they leave.

  "Help me decide on my next laptop I recently purchased a 4K monitor to hook up to my laptop. My laptop is pretty ancient and unfortunately is not capable of displaying 3840 x 2160 on the monitor. So i've been looking around to upgrade the laptop which was probably due anyway.\n\nI mostly use my computer for internet, YouTube, Twitch and some work stuff on MS Office and occasional coding (nothing complex at this stage). I don't need anything resembling a gaming laptop although would appreciate some good speakers if I watch something on the computer.\n\n\\- Screen size is important to me and I would like to stick with 15.6 inch, or go to 16 inch. I am used to a matte screen and some of the glossy screens I have seen seem to suffer from glare / reflective which puts me off from going glossy.- I would prefer to have a number pad on the keyboard too.- Longevity: I would like something which will last me at least 5 years so am going for 16GB RAM.- **Must be able to display 4K resolution when connected to my 4K monitor**\n\nAfter much looking around I think I have narrowed my search down to the below choices. I have concerns about each and hopefully someone can help :) I should add that the Samsung and Lenovo are both similar in price.\n\n\\- **Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro**: It has an i7-1260P CPU, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, HDMI 2.0, Thunderbolt ports. The computer is thin and light, it has a number pad. The speakers are decent sounding. The computer is perfect for my requirements except the **screen**. The screen is a glossy AMOLED panel displaying 1920 x 1080 at 60hz. In the store I found it a bit reflective. The major concern is whether it will suffer from dead pixels and burn-in which I have read can happen with OLED displays and maybe I should stick with an LCD / IPS screen. The computer comes with a **1 year warranty** so after that I am at risk. [Samsung](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/samsung-galaxy-book2-pro-15.6-laptop-intel-core-i7-512-gb-ssd-silver-10236963.html)\n\n\\- **Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro**:  It has an AMD Ryzen 5, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 16\" WQXGA+ displaying 2560 x 1600 and I believe up to 120hz, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 4GB GPU. I believe the computer has a matte display and a number pad. Reviews generally seem to be good. Some comments that it runs a bit noisy. The ports are not as good as on the Samsung. When I search for information on the product there's some mixed messaging about the **HDMI**. The following link states it's HDMI 2.0 and so does Lenovo site. Some of the YouTube reviews said it's 1.4b which means it wouldn't be able to display 4K at 60hz - they could be wrong of course. Some reviews mention the computer shuts down after going to sleep - i'm not sure if this is user error or can't be changed. The Lenovo comes with a **2 year warranty**. [Lenovo](https://www.johnlewis.com/lenovo-ideapad-5-pro-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-16-inch-wqxga-storm-grey/p6404704)\n\n\\- **Dell XPS 15:** I could maybe push the budget and stretch to an XPS 15 with an i7 processor and 16GB RAM. If I buy new unused from the outlet and use a discount code. The panel is glossy but meant to have anti-glare on it. There's no number pad which is disappointing. Unlike the Samsung and Lenovo, the RAM is not soldered and can be upgraded in future.  I have read reviews about it being a bit unreliable, overheating, the fans running often to cool the computer.\n\nIf you have made it this far, I really appreciate the time and any advice / guidance which you can offer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8lwxwaqa1ua1.jpg?width=1325&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbfe1eca2126ceb8b536b4966f3bc4c25773fa3c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/schfmx2oa1ua1.jpg?width=943&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=930a67235c99a5ddc2496baa67a71d06be3921f5",

  "What are good laptops for gaming & work under 1500€? Looking for a laptop which would be good both for gaming and working, preferably 16GB RAM. Built in CD/DVD reader is a must. RGB keyboard would be a plus but would be survivable without it as well. It would be neat if the cost was ~1200€ but I'd be able to afford up to 1500€ or around that. I won't be able to buy a new computer in the next few years so it is very important for me to pick the best one within my price range. \n\nI understand nothing else besides RAM when it comes to computer specifics, so what are the things I should pay more attention to?\n\nThe most common brands here are ASUS&Lenovo, are those any good?

  "Portugal, 1000-1500€, looking for suggestions * **Total budget and country of purchase:** \nI will be buying in Portugal and budget is up to 1000€ or 1500€ maximum.\n\n* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** \n2 in 1 is not desired, good battery life is an important point. Since the price range I am aiming for is more high end, bang for buck is not that much a problem but being able to spend less is always better.\n\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**\nPortability is also important, but can be slightly sacrificed for better specs if need be. The main factor is it being light, size is not as big a concern. I would like it to be under 3kg, preferrably 1.5 - 2kg.\n\n* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**\nI normally work in Linux (mostly Ubuntu so support is supposedly better, but it is very important that the laptop works well with Linux) with some possibility for **very ocasional** work in windows (with non cross-platform programs).\n\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** \nN/A\n\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** \nThe main use for the computer will be programming, since I am currently a computer engineering student. No gaming will be done, unless it is very light gaming that any computer can handle, nor any sort of video editing or CAD work. Some light photo editing might be done but it is not a concern since it will not be very frequent nor be very heavy. In terms of programs, mostly IDEs and browsers, text editors. Maybe sometimes virtual machines but that will be very rare and not much resource intensive.\n\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** \nN/A\n\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** \nGood keyboard would be a very nice extra, since I will be typing there a lot. It is more useful to me to have USB A ports than USB C ones, at least for now (I wouldn't want to be living in #donglelife). Touch screen, finger print reader, optical drive, etc are not at all necessary. Good build quality would be nice in terms of having good durability, since I am planning in keeping the computer for as long as I can and at least until I finish my degree.\n\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**\nI have investigated beforehand, mostly looking at ultrabooks in this price range in a local computer website, so I will leave them here in case this helps, but I don't really know how to pick between them.\nI have found the following options:\n\n    *  [Asus VivoBook S15 15.6\" S510UN-78B94DB1 - 959,90€](https://www.pcdiga.com/portatil-asus-vivobook-s15-15-6-s510un-78b94db1) (Couldn't find much information on this laptop :/)\n    * [HP Pavilion Notebook 14-bf101np 14\" - 999€](https://www.pcdiga.com/portatil-hp-pavilion-notebook-14-bf101np-14) (Same as above)\n    * [Acer Swift 5 14\" SF514-52T-83N4 - 1099,00€](https://www.pcdiga.com/portatil-acer-swift-5-14-sf514-52t-83n4) (Currently under 100€ discount)\n    * [Lenovo Ideapad 720S 14\" 720S-14IKB-774 - 1349,00€](https://www.pcdiga.com/portatil-lenovo-ideapad-720s-14-720s-14ikb-774) (Currently under 50€ discount - lol)\n    *  [Lenovo ThinkPad T480 14\" - 1489,90€](https://www.pcdiga.com/portatil-lenovo-thinkpad-t480-4524) (i7 version, the i5 version is 125€ cheaper so I guess the upgrade is probably worth it in terms of longevity?)\n    * [Dell XPS 9360 13.3\" FHD i7 8GB 256GB W10 Pro Silver - 1499,00€](https://www.pcdiga.com/portatil-dell-xps-9360-13-3-fhd-i7-8gb-256gb-w10-pro-silver) (Have heard very good things about it, and is currently the option I am looking towards the most. The difference from the i5 to the i7 model is around 100€ so is also probably worth it in terms of lasting more time I guess? According to [MobileTechReview's comparison video between the 9370 and 9360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l5LNiz4Kic&t=318s) it seems that the 9360 is more indicated for my usage, hence it being here and the 9370 not)\n    * [Lenovo ThinkPad T480s 14\" - 1599,90€](https://www.pcdiga.com/portatil-lenovo-thinkpad-t480s-14) (A bit above the price range but included for completeness sake)\n\nThank you for any and all help you can provide! :) If you need to look up prices in portugal you can use [this store website](https://www.pcdiga.com/), or [this store aggregator website](https://www.kuantokusta.pt/).",
  "Help finding budget £300 laptop for parent, general/moderate use [UK] Looking for a new laptop for my Dad, I'm a techy person but don't know much about laptops, I've always build my own desktops. It seems rather confusing with the same models available with different CPUs. So, his requirements.\n\n- Around £300, £330 is probably the upper limit unless there is something really worth a bit more.\n- His usage will be typical 50-somerthing Dad - web browsing, watching movies, streaming online video and basic little games similar to flash games online, no \"proper\" games so GPU is not really important. Writing documents occasionally, that's about it. No photoshop or anything even moderately intense like that.\n- Hard drive space, 500GB will be fine, he gets by with 80GB on his current one. Anything bigger a bonus.\n- I wouldn't imagine he'll be doing anything intensive enough to need over 4GB of RAM but 8GB is obviously better.\n- Good WiFi reception/speed. We're on a 70Mbps connection.\n- Screen, looking around you're basically limited to 15.6\" @ 1366 for this size, that's fine.\n- Battery obviously the better, the er, better. At least 5 hours would be good.\n- OS doesn't matter as long as it's Windows, he wants W10 and anything for sale these days is 7+, so fine for upgrading free.\n\nThe options I've found so far:\n\n* Lenovo ideapad 305 (Version with i3-5005U) - £300 from Amazon\n* Toshiba 15.6\" A8 8GB 1TB Laptop - £300 from Argos\n* HP ProBook 450 G2 Laptop - £310 from eBuyer\n* HP 350 G2 Laptop - £300 from eBuyer after cashback\n\nThey all seem decent enough but when you look at reviews they always seem to have something bad to say about them, although I guess at this price range it's to be expected. So, any other options please let me know. To my eyes the Lenovo is probably the best bet out of those?\n\nOh forgot to say, must be new. He doesn't want 2nd hand or refurbished. Also no Acers, he hates that brand. Dads, right. "
