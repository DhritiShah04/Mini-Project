  "Ideapad pro 5 vs legion 5 Hi, I am thinking about buying a new laptop for collage and I can't decide which to get. I have been looking at reviews online and so far im interested in ideapad pro 5 gen 10 (ryzen ai 7 350 and rtx 5050) and legion 5 gen 10 (didn't decide on cpu yet and rtx 5060). I care about battery life and fan noise because I spend quite some time in the library. Im also gonna be doing some CAD work for collage and playing some games like minecraft and rocket league (no AAA games) in my free time. Im also open to other suggestions. Thank you :)",
  "Lenovo bad. HP better? IdeaPad Pro 5 (8845HS) and Yoga Pro 7 (155H) vs Omnibook Ultra 14 (AI 365) Hi everyone!  \nSorry for the click-bait topic. I want to ask about buying HP over Lenovo. In order to make this post more valuable, I'll write down a short review of the Lenovo laptops because I found many people are looking for similar things in a laptop as me. Also including the OLED vs IPS opinion. I'll add 8845HS vs 155H review later.\n\nOriginally, I wrote a long post, but I didn't save it and it got lost. I'll try to make it short this time.\n\n**What am I looking for?**  \nI want a small work laptop that I could also use for my personal things. It should have good CPU, 32GB of RAM and 100% sRGB because I intend to use it for editing photos while traveling. I also wanted iGPU because it's good enough for the tasks I intend to use it for.\n\n**Why I don't want OLED**  \nOLED screen is dominant in the class of laptops I am looking at. And generally it's a selling point of many laptops. I understand why, but it's no good for my use-case.  \nI use a lot of static content Programming/Lightroom/Web and when I am working, I want to use my laptop as a second screen, which means opened browser or a VS Code for extended periods of time. Of course, this is exactly the use-case that's not great for OLEDs. I also went to a local shop and I saw that the OLED screens have a burn in. I understand that the laptops might be there for a long time, but still.. I don't want to limit my productivity to mitigate something that's going to happen sooner or later. Also the eye strain is real. So it's an IPS for me.\n\n**IdeaPad Pro 5 14AHP9**  \nThis was a big step up from ThinkPad E590 I had before. The performance is great. It's even better than 5600X I have in my PC. But I was being worried about the OLED burn in too much in the long run. Otherwise it was a perfect choice for me. \n\nPros:  \n\\- Very good specs  \n\\- Full metal case  \n\\- Good keyboard  \n\\- Good connectivity with 2 USB-C (USB-4), 2 USB-A and a SD card reader  \n\\- 85Wh battery  \n\\- **Quiet**\n\nCons:  \n\\- Very limited customizations  \n  ThrottleStop doesn't support 8845HS, you can't do much in the BIOS, you can't adjust fan curve  \n\\- OLED burn in  \n\\- 240Hz PWM\n\n**Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14IMH9**  \nI was hesitant to choose Intel because I believe AMD is better, but it has a nice IPS display and it fit my requirements perfectly.  \nI don't know if it's because of the Intel processor, but it's **loud.** Every time it get's above 60C, the fans just start spinning for some time. The CPU reaches 38C in the mean time. WHY?. And it happens even while browsing. The fans are also very high-pitched and annoying. The fan curve from Lenovo is terrible and I couldn't change it. It behaves like that in all power modes. Lenovo restricts any customization for some reason. It's very annoying and that's basically the only reason why I am looking for some other options.\n\nPros:  \n\\- IPS with 100% sRGB  \n\\- Very good specs  \n\\- Full metal case  \n\\- Good keyboard  \n\\- Thunderbolt 4  \n\\- 14.5\" display with minimal overall size change  \n\\- Good light use efficiency thanks to E-cores\n\nCons:  \n\\- Terrible fan curve (loud)  \n\\- Power button located on the side means accidental shut downs  \n\\- Only one USB-A  \n\\- Very limited customizations  \n  ThrottleStop doesn't support 8845HS, you can't do much in the BIOS, you can't adjust fan curve\n\n  \n**IdeaPad Pro 5 14AHP9 vs Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14IMH9**  \nBoth look very much the same and I really like the design. Yoga is a bit larger thanks to the 14.5\" display which is better for productivity and you can't really tell when carrying it.  \nThe build quality is better on the Yoga. It has a more premium feeling, but it's really not noticeable. The only noticeable things are the bezel around the screen is glass vs plastic on the IdeaPad. Another thing is keyboard, which is meant to feel more premium on the Yoga. It has a great travel but it's harder to press than on IdeaPad that's why I prefer the IdeaPad keyboard.\n\n**Ryzen 9 8845HS vs Intel 155H**  \nAMD is definitely more power efficient during moderate tasks. I think it's also part of the reason why IdeaPad is more quiet. \n\n**HP OmniBook Ultra 14 (AI 365)**  \nThis is an option I am looking into and I want your opinion on it. It's about 150$ more expensive, but it has a newer ZEN 5.  \nI'll share my cons and pros about this laptop. What I would really appreciate is your experience with the noise. Also if you can do more customizations like a fan curve using FanControl.\n\nPros:  \n\\- ZEN 5 (quiet?)  \n\\- IPS with 100% sRGB  \n\\- More customizability?\n\nCons:  \n\\- Worse design  \n\\- Large bezel (the laptop is the size of Yoga which has 14.5\" vs 14\")  \n\\- USB-C in the corner  \n\\- More expensive  \n\nWhat I ultimately want to achieve (and what is achievable with the IdeaPad) is that I want my laptop dead silent during some light work.\n\nI hope somebody will be able to share their experience and help me decide. I also hope I could help somebody else decide!\n\nThanks!",

  "For the price you will have to look at your countries offers and if you get some kind of discounts like student discount, that Lenovo offers. \nIs it worth it? Depends on the price and what you need. If you can find a ryzen ai 7 or core ultra 7 256v laptop with good display and the ports you need, for about the same price or 150$ more, that will be the better option. \nI'm really happy with it tho, I use it 10 hours a day for studying and gaming and battery life, display and performance are just great.

  "Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro 16\" Review (Comparing to Dell/HP/Samsung) My old HP Envy broke so I purchased 3 consecutive laptops and returned them all. The new HP Envy screen made my eyes hurt, the dell Inspiron 16 had really odd sounding speakers and shut down randomly even after re-installing windows, and the Samsung Galaxy Pro Book was sleek and well built but the screen was very pixelated. All where Ryzen 7 besides the Galaxy which was i7\n\nThe fourth laptop I tried was the  Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro 16\" QHD Laptop with AMD Core Ryzen 5 5600H / 8GB RAM. I got it on sale for $500 and thought it would be very basic.\n\n1. The build is awesome and has the best keyboard out of all 4 laptops I've tried. Sleek and seems light but sturdy.\n2. Sounds is great and features like face-scan sign in are appreciated.\n3. Start up time is fast fast fast\n4. Also, I accidentally put a lot of my weight on the screen (laptop was shut) when trying to kill a bug on the wall and the screen survived no blemishes.\n\nCon:\n\n1. Matte screen is not super appealing but the more I use it the more I don't mind a matte screen at this price range.\n2. I would not want to pay $900 for this but if you can get it under $600 thats a real deal.\n\nThis is my first Lenovo and I am impressed so far, for $500 total paid this is an A+.",

An Intel 11300H MX450 8/512GB model for $530.\n\nThey all have the same display and build quality and its a pretty solid line up to pick out how much horsepower you need in this budget friendly yet premium design.",

What would be the actual battery backup of the 6600HS version? My primary requirement is longevity, that it should at least survive my multiple browser tabs for 5 to 6 years. I have been using one IdeaPad 330S 14\" by Lenovo with 8 GB of RAM and 512 SSD, with one TB hard drive and extremely poor battery life that is for 3.5 hours and I've been using it for a 3 year and 8 months. Do you think if I do not take Apple Care Plus then I should not be touching Mac and I would be better off with one Windows device?\n\nI don't use any Apple products. Fixing Apple with out of pocket is surely scary! But, I just can't find a Windows alternative with similar battery life. While Apple is asking significantly more money for less RAM and storage, but yes I understand that there are things beyond RAM & SSD for which they are doing it. I have been used to cheap Windows machines so much that I am pretty reluctant to pay 850 for a Windows machine. I am building this argument in my head that if I am going to pay above 850, then it shouldn't be a Windows machine. But, then comes the back and forth discussion on what are you getting for your money actually! It is frustrating! I still can't decide.",

  "Great, thanks! And the battery life? In specs is usually around 9h, but I didn't find any review in English so...",
  "Battery life will be better on the mac and the 16GB RAM will go farther in MacOS than in Windows. The Pro 14 probably gets around 10 hours real world use depending on what you're doing but the M1 Air gets like 15 hours real world use.\n\nMacOS is more efficient with RAM and swap so a 16GB M1 Air will feel more like 24GB in Windows. That is the major downside to the Ideapad Pro line is the soldered RAM. I got 16GB soldered and I am fully aware of the RAM limitation in Windows, and I am fully prepared to run Linux in a few years if I need my RAM to be used more efficiently.\n\nHonestly the only reason I got the Ideapad Pro 16 over a Mac was 1. I like to game while I'm traveling and 2. I wanted a bigger screen. The only big laptop Apple offers is insanely expensive. I get like 80% of the experience for half the cost. But the Ideapad Pro 14 vs the MBA 13, you don't really lose much with the MBA in terms of screen real estate, but you gain so much in battery life and RAM utilization without paying twice as much.\n\nDo you live near a micro center? If so, check if they have any more of these refurb Ideapad Pro 14 in stock.

Again, my priorities are longevity, and good real world use. I am a grad student from literary background, so research and writing is what I do. No gaming or using intense softwares at all!\n\nI am scared to use any refurbished product unless it is a personal source or something like that.

It’s a Lenovo refurb so it’s from the factory, micro center is just the store front.

  "ASUS Zenbook 14 vs LENOVO IdeaPad 5i Pro 14\" for portability, research, and essays hi everyone!\n\ni'm in the market for a new laptop and these two are standing out to me, i'd love to hear some thoughts on which is the better option\n\n[https://www.currys.co.uk/products/asus-zenbook-14-um425qa-14-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-512-gb-ssd-grey-10240188.html](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/asus-zenbook-14-um425qa-14-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-512-gb-ssd-grey-10240188.html)\n\n[https://www.currys.co.uk/products/lenovo-ideapad-5i-pro-14-laptop-intel-core-i5-512-gb-ssd-grey-10239724.html](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/lenovo-ideapad-5i-pro-14-laptop-intel-core-i5-512-gb-ssd-grey-10239724.html)\n\nthe reasons for me needing a new laptop is that i'm starting a new in person college course and also a new online postgrad course. neither will require anything particularly intensive (mainly research and essay writing, a couple windows open and i also tend to be a bit tab heavy when browsing and researching). a big priority for me is portability as i need to be able to take the laptop with me places, as i'll be doing a lot of work on my break at work and also taking it into college, and even using it during commutes, meaning weight and battery life\n\ni understand that the lenovo has the better processor, and this is the main selling point for this laptop for me. however, the asus is lighter and what looks like much better battery life which in my use case i feel will be really important (though, some reviews seem to imply that the asus's usual battery life is actually more like 9 hours which closes the gap a lot). i've also found it harder to find reviews of the 14\" version of the lenovo and i think that's been making me a lean towards the asus as well as i've heard little in the way of feedback about how the lenovo is. but the 12th gen i5 does sound like a great processor that's hard to find much comparable at the sub 500 mark. i'd also love to hear some thoughts on heat management, durability, and screen quality for these models\n\ni do have some hobby based interests in photography but editing isn't a priority as i have a desktop set up at home\n\ni'd also like to ask as a bit of a secondary question, in whether people think that going for a 2 in 1 flex design would be worth it for my use case or is it more of a gimmick?\n\nthanks so much for reading and any help and advice you might be able to give me :)",

  "Ideapad 5 Pro with Ryzen 6600HS - Thoughts? I spotted the Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro (Part 82SJ0005US) sitting at $740 on Lenovo's website today, which feels like a pretty low price for a laptop with a Ryzen 6000 series CPU, 16GB RAM, and a 1 TB SSD. I'm curious about the 6600HS specifically since I can barely find any review of laptops that use it. Based on the higher TDP, I'd expect it to outperform the 6600U. Does anyone have experience with a laptop containing the 6600HS? I'd also be interested to know how the battery life is with a 35 W TDP chip. Thanks!",
  "It's amazing. The HS processor is only a level below the H processor and miles ahead of the U while still achieving great battery life.\nThe machine in question has a 75whr battery I guess, but I have a similar model and my battery lasts ages and doesn't even get noisy or heat up much when under heavy load.",
  "Hi, I’m considering the same one or the Intel one. Curious to hear thoughts.",
  "Ryzen H35 and Intel P28 are still branches of \"H-series\". These are CPUs targeted at professionals who do heavy-multi-threaded work, and who do not need super long battery life.\n\nYou will see a lot of tech reviewers mindlessly recommending laptops with these chips but they are not really made for casual users in mind.",
  "Yea this laptop looks great, and from the last gens performance this one should be pretty good, you should definetly look into it",
  "Did you end up buying this laptop? I'm currently considering this one over the Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro with 5825U CPU. I'm mostly interested if the 6600HS version will last a full 8 hour school day. Reasons to go for the 6600HS are the 660M GPU which will allow for some light gaming.",
  "I did buy this laptop and overall it's performing well, the 660M is a big step up from my previous device. In battery-saver mode I can get just about 8 hours of light browsing / note-taking, and I think there are more advanced ways that you can further decrease power usage.",

  "Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Pro 14\" QHD 400 nits (feedback requested) Oof, it is a long time since I bought a super expensive Dell Inspiron 5000 laptop. :) Cost the same as a used car back then, or about $5000. Even my boss thought it was expensive. The old Dell machine had a 15\" screen.\n\nI think I can follow the trend in technology but I thought I'd put this here and ask for feedback for this one particular type of laptop. Feel free to chime in.\n\nThe following is a smaller laptop, with a noticeable small'ish screen without a num keyboard. I don't need the num keyboard and so I would rather go with the lighter weight, than the other variant with a 16\" screen.

(Can't go wrong with an IPS screen I would think.)\n\nAMD Radeon 680M (Maybe a dedicated gfx card?) (Edit: Could be a gpu on the cpu die perhaps.)\n\n1080p camera (Edit: A German website states this being a 2Megapixel camera.)\n\nRealtek ALC3287 (So.. sound at least)\n\nKeyboard with backlighting (Nice, or, that sounds nice.)\n\nWifi and bluetooth\n\nBattery power, up to 16 hours it says with reduced screen brightness (Yes, I don't quite trust this)\n\nBattery power:  56.5 Wh\n\n2 + 1 +1  USB 3.2 ports (maybe 2 or 3 for utility, and 1 for power chord?)\n\nHDMI port\n\nmic and headset port (analogue)\n\n4 in 1 card reader (Nice)\n\nWeight 1.41 kg (not too bad)\n\nMin operating temperature: 5 deg C (lol, what?)\n\nDimensions:  31.22 cm (width) x 22.1 cm (depth) x 1.59 cm (height)\n\nKeyboard + touchpad\n\nAluminium chassis (But a reviewer says plastic framing on inside of screen).\n\nOS: Win 11 (well, not very important to me, choice of OS undecided, but can't ask for empty SSD.)\n\nSpeakers: Some on bottom I think, some on top side. Heh, imagine food and stuff clogging the top mesh for the speakers, might be hard to clean. I really ought to stop eating food in front of my keyboard. Edit: Review commenter claims speakers are bottom facing, but also \"sounds upwards\".\n\nLooks like lots of venting holes at the front underside (or maybe it was back side), which I guess means one shouldn't place the laptop on top of fabric, like in your bed, risking covering the vent openings.\n\nI know from before that, althought one guy on the internet might be complaining about bad build quality or flaws, that might not be representative of the product that most people have, still, when someone comment on what they think is a flimsy or noisy laptop as some other model I checked, that is no fun.\n\nEdit: A reviewer comments that his integrated graphics version of this laptop, had noticeable noise when compared to the version with dedicated Nvidia card on it.\n\nEdit: I deleted some previous comment of mine about a reviewer's video review online, about a supposed 1 year old issue with some unknown configuration that probably is fixed by now. Also little if no info online found on this.",
  "I learned today that the 'CE' designation for the cpu, means \"creator edition\". Presumably, this might mean better performing cpu, or possibly, hotter cpu due to it being better performing. Sry, I am no expert on cpus, so I am not sure what to think about that.",
  "im planning on buying this laptop too, i think the new ryzen is the beast considering the efficiency per wattage of AMD is far better than Intel now (6nm vs 10nm), radeon680 is using newest tech of AMD(rdna2) for integrated GPU and is better than Iris Xe if you want gaming. Battery i think average 5-6hrs usage, maybe more if u just playing video all the time.",
  "Some things I think I've learned:\n\n(Edit: Oops, looks like the default non Intel wifi card also has 6G and ax built in.)\n\n~~The wifi card is 5G only, or (ac) standard, not ax (6G).~~ ~~Though it sort of looks like you can buy the Intel ax-210 wifi card, and get the ax standard for as little as $30-40 or something like that. Presumably Windows 11 has the drivers ready in the OS for it, and presumably, the Intel card is already whitelisted, but I honestly don't understand this whitelisting of devices, maybe an old thing by now, unsure.~~\n\nNo idea what quality the 1080p webcam has, maybe 5 megapixels? Maybe not.\n\nI hope I can install a Linux distro later, but that might be a little troublesome if Lenovo only officially supports Linux for their ThinkPad line of laptops. Or, maybe there isn't much of a problem, very much unsure about all of that.\n\nOne review seem to claim that \"storm gray\" is a silver gray, but it really seems like \"storm gray\" is a darker gray, and that the lighter gray is called \"cloud gray\".\n\nThere seem to be software for efficiently controlling the TDP limits with Ryzen cpu's, found at this website called 'AATU'. This should help lower any heat issue with boosts, to also reduce fan noise I think. A reviewer set the option to 1 sec, so the setting not only loads on boot, but is set every second to ensure the TDP limits are forced onto the cpu properly for the entire duration of your work session.\n\n[https://amdaputuningutility.com](https://amdaputuningutility.com) (Presumaly a legit website, but ofc one shouldn't blindly install software so maybe do some checks on this first.)\n\nThe 1080p camera, apparently has a privacy shutter which is nice. Then there is an infrared camera as well, which may or may not also be hidden behind the same cover.\n\nThe fingerprint sensor can be physically disconnected from the motherboard appartently. Unsure if that messes up anything in the OS. Unsure if that also disconnected the on/off button.\n\nI think I read that you can program the laptop to boot up, when you open the lid, and vice versa. Unsure if that requires the infrared camera to work or not.\n\nOnly iffy thing so far, might imo be the trackpad, which is said to be so so.\n\nI think I will be very happy with this choice overall, although there will never be any 32 GB ram upgrade.\n\nIt looks like you can easily fix your own laptop with authentic spare parts, which seems nice, and not too difficult. However, the keyboard is fused with the top side, and so, the entire (and presumalby non-metal) top side around the keyboard, has to be replaced, but might not be purchasable, but I guess you can ask their support perahaps for such a sparepart possibly.\n\nFor longevity of the battery, I think you have to rely on some Lenovo software that only charges the battery up to 80%, iirc, which seems like similar to some electric cars that by default charge just to 90%, to avoid premature wear on the battery.\n\nSadly, the usb ports only offer max 5 Gbps transfer rate, or less than 1GB per second  (probably much less) I think. The more advanced standard would have been the double transfer rate, 10 Gbps.\n\nLastly, there is afaik a very recent BIOS update, dated 2023 found on Lenovos website for the 14ARH7 variant which I think this configuration of Lenovo Ideapad 5 pro 14\" is called (unsure).",
  "and look at that 6400mhz ram, crazy.",
  "I think I might also replace the possibly OEM M.2 device with a 1 TB Samsung 980 pro one. I can keep the one with Win 11, whenever I need to update bios and such.\n\nI am pleasantly surprised by the seemingly nice screen resolution options on modern laptops like this one. Normally high res (2K) equate to tiny, OS icons, but there should be ways to scale those back up.\n\nGlad I don't have to look at another TN screen ever again. I had one with this greenish tint to it. :)  Not a laptop, but an old Eizo screen, a cheaper one.",

It's incredible, especially when coming from a limiting chromebook and an even more limiting iPad mini, lol!

I was wrong. (the 155H version has touch-screen: [SFG14-72T-71QF](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72t-71qf) along with a 16\" version. Look for the icon with a finger pointing.)\n\nmajor cons:\n\n* the battery life is lower compared to other ultrabooks, maybe 6-10 hours vs 10-14 hours zenbook, perhaps due to the 65w vs 75w battery(?). I can't say yet, and maybe windows (and it's bloatware) is still doing something, but i got 10 hours on my first three charges, draining at \\~10%/hour; But i also always use minimum brightness, and just had the normal 30 tabs open (edge, most tabs sleeping) with music playing. Conversely, perhaps because it has a smaller battery, it charges very very quickly: an hour or so (with the given charger). It's also nice that usb-c was standardized for charging, though i wished the usb-c cable would detach from the power block... A minor gripe. After the first few drains, i've kept the laptop charged, and used some pre-installed Acer program to limit charging when plugged-in (to 80%, no choice). This really is it's only major con.\n* the OLED is glossy. so glossy you can see a deep, deep, and rich reflection of yourself. It's like looking into a dark mass of water. It raises self-awareness and horror :cold\\_face:\n\nproblems likely similar to other ultrabooks, and other notes:\n\n* fan noise, and heat. when it speeds up, it's clearly audible in a quiet bedroom when it starts up. it can start with very little computering ([the zenbook got panned in a review for being worse](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Zenbook-14-OLED-review-The-1-2-kg-subnotebook-with-120-Hz-OLED-and-Core-Ultra-7.805236.0.html)), then it goes back to silent mode, and thankfully, *stays* silent. And when it's silent, it's *absolutely* silent! It's apparently not louder than it's competitors tho?? sounds fine to me... *Thank goodness!* Along with fan noise, it can get a little warm at the palms. I think this happened during the beginning of it charging. Thankfully, the aluminum(?) case ensures it cools down quickly, and keeps it cool. (this is my portable-desktop-laptop, wherein i plan to use a separate mechanical keyboard most of the time anyway). However, when it's not charging, it seems to stay quiet 'n cool, which is the most important time.\n* the speakers are bass-less, but the amp is surprisingly incredible(!!).. but then again, i've never heard good laptop speakers in my life. Zero bass, which i'm okay with, as i'm a dreamy-pop treble music person, but just say no to lo-fi/city-pop. It's interesting to hear bass guitars without the bass.. It reminds me of my old purple 'n gold ATH-AD700 headphones that i adore, but far worse mixing. The audio goes through some artificial spatial surround sound software: the mids seem to live recessed in the bottom center of the laptop (vocals), then are overtly forwarded to every direction / speaker in the artificial speaker system (piano), the highs are all over the place, moving from one part of the laptop to another; and the lows remind me of bad midi music. Your favorite music will *not* move you. You will however listen to your favorite music in a very different way.. Having said that, the speakers can get very loud, easily able to fill up a room(!!), and most importantly: beyerdynamic 300r 32ohm headphones sound great at a mere 10% volume!\n* the up and down arrow keys share a single key area. I use wasd for gaming, so it doesn't bother me. This also keeps the keyboard's shape to a neat rectangle.\n* the left modifier keys aren't big. they're the same size as the letter 'n number keys. The right modifier keys, however, are slightly wider. They had to do this to make space for the function key. UPDATE: i re-mapped/swapped left-control with left-alt, mac-style. much better. i'll likely re-map holding caps-lock to left-control too.\n* the keys feel only slightly better than my $40 samsung chromebook 4, which, now that i'm looking at it, surprisingly, has the big fat left modifier keys and complete arrow keys too! Not bad, that thing! (for programmers the tilde key and delete keys are nice to have, and nicely placed, as are the half-size function/special keys... tho, i'm scared of what bloatware the acer key will manifest..!) UPDATE: in retrospect, it's actually a great keyboard. I ordered a keychron k6, and those red keys are god awful. Seriously, who want's to press a key down for a one-half inch?? I've become used to the tiny distance of laptop keyboards..\n* the 14\" screen is a huge surprise coming from an 11.6\" chromebook (2.4\" is a lot!) and even the 13.3\" macbook, yet it's dimensions are only very slightly larger (<1\"). There's about an inch of empty space on both sides of the keyboard--I'm the sort of person who saw the 15\" Macbook and thought, *\"ugh, what is all that space for!?\"*, and didn't buy one until the 13\" came out. The massive OLED screen gets as close as you'd want to the edges--any closer, your fingerprints would smudge the beautiful screen when opening/closing it. As does the massive trackpad.\n* the bigger touchpad may cause more accidents. I haven't had enough experience, but thus far, it seems fine for my hands, for the most part. I did have had it click on random parts of this review i'm writing quite a few times.. but then again, i'm currently sitting at a bad angle. UPDATE: i love it. bigger is better. i must have gotten used to it, as i don't accidentally touch it anymore..\n* the ports are perfect for me, as i'm not updated on current technology: two thunderbolt(?, new to me), two usb--one on each side!!!, one hmdi, a headphone jack, an sd card reader, and a good ol' kensington lock, lol. I've never used a lock before, but have always found it intriguing . I feel the port choices are very old-school, like me. :) It might be possible for 4 displays for this chip...!? (note: smaller 13.3\" laptops can compromise on ports)\n* bloatware. after 20 years, this still exists. Why? McAfee still exists..?? I did however use the 1 year of 100GB dropbox. Could someone please ship me a usb flash drive or sd card so that i can re-install windows? ;(\n\nwith all the similar \"ultrabooks\" (Asus zenbook, Lenovo yoga, HP spectre, Dell xps 14, maybe even the lower-end Acer spin, Asus flipbook, Asus vivobook, HP pavilion plus, Dell inspiron plus, 'n so on), i felt it's pretty hard to decide on one, and just went with what good deals i found on eBay, and checked the review on notebookcheck, and double-checked that the specs are indeed \"ultra\" (weight, size, build quality--not plastic).\n\nit's direct local (to Taiwan) competition is the asus zenbook, and i actually think that's a better notebook. Better speakers, better keyboard (i prefer big keys over the macbook chiclet-style), betters looks (premium business ultrabook vs macbook clone), lighter (an insane 1.3kg), and most importantly a better battery (75w vs 65w, 12+ hours vs 8 in tests!), but, notebookcheck's review noted a fan noise problem, due to it having a single fan / heat-sink vs this Acer's double fan 'n heat-sink. The problem could just be a fluke, but def worth researching other users experiences about it. Beyond that single problem though, i def prefer the zenbook. However, if a macbook clone is what you're really into, this Acer is just that!: a 14\" Macbook Pro (possibly for half the price due to bad resale value)\n\ni personally chose the Intel ultra series for it's great games/power balance, and x64 architecture. I missed out on the entire AMD marathon. An older asus rog flow x13 (g14 doesn't have touch-screen), razer blade 14, or microsoft surface pro (intel ultra series, not the newer ARM arch models) would have been my top choices, if i were to accept something more used. The previous gen surfaces were way too expensive! But i'm super stoked with what i got for $550. Wow! Also, i love Taiwan (made in Taiwan <3), so Acer 'n Asus were actually my top choices (they do all the hard work of making everything, and are absolutely lovely people with an incredible culture to behold, so let them have all my monies!). Actually, i've been fond of the swift series laptops, particularly swift 3 series and 5 series, ever since that time i went to a physical store to test 'n compare laptops. They were by far the best deals in the \"budget\" range. They were all ultrabooks in my eyes, for a fraction of the price of one.\n\nthe OLED is stunning. Now there's absolutely no need for a Macbook for me. My last one was a late-201313\" MBP. Hello again, Windows. How i've missed you dearly. And oh my, how you've accepted Linux..?? I don't even need Linux anymore, and that's coming from Arch! Also, having done some programming, i can't justify the sufferings that Apple has made programmers go through over its reign. Microsoft has since made a big turn towards accepting open-source, linux, programmers, etc. Strange, but good... i hope.\n\nfor my personal needs, the lower-resolution IPS touch-screen would've been ideal, for both touch input and possibly better gaming performance (*does native resolution matter nowadays..?*). It is indeed a major bummer. However, i feel that without the the ability to swivel the screen around (\"convertible\"), it would've made an odd touch-screen experience anyway, quite different from tablets. Also very important to note, **there's quite a few touch-screen OLED notebooks--**[**including the zenbook**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/13wdvxm/oled_touchscreen_is_awful/)**--, that suffer from a grainy screen problem**--though, i don't know which exact models / year have this problem. So, in the end, i feel it was more of a blessing. Anyway, i'm hoping my next job will pay for a premium laptop. At the moment, if money were not a factor, i'd go for either the Asus rog flow x13 or dreamy z13. The z13 is all i've ever dreamed for, ever since the iPad came out. ;) ...but i've read that even the z13 suffers from a very low battery life. :/\n\nUPDATE: now that i've got OLED, i can't imagine ever going back.. o.o\n\nso, if i were to choose again, a \"new\" 2022 asus rog flow x13 ryzen 7940HS would have been my choice, and very very surprisingly, it's going for a mere \\~$800!! So, unless you find a deal like mine, you should just go for one of the best out there! Otherwise, this is an incredibly solid laptop for its price. It has also easily convinced me macbooks aren't worth it anymore, as it was a decade ago, even considering the newer ARM M-series. I'm a believer of Acer/Asus/Taiwan!",
  "Is the fan noise not that big of a deal? I plan to buy this same model, and will be using this inside my university's computer laboratory. And I don't want to distract others with the fan noise.",
  "I bought my Acer Swift Go 14 on September 28, featuring an Ultra 5 125H processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and a 90Hz OLED HDR display running Windows 11 (23H2). I got it for 60,000 INR after discounts, down from around 80K. My previous laptop was the ASUS FX504, which I used for 6 years.\n\n# Negatives:\n\n* Wi-Fi Speeds & Performance: The ASUS consistently outperforms the Acer in download speeds, and I occasionally feel a static sensation when touching the metal surface while charging.\n* Sharp Trackpad Edge & Heat During Charging: The trackpad edge is uncomfortable, and the right side gets hot while charging, making it tough to use on my lap.\n* Useless Copilot Key & Keyboard Backlight: I remapped the Copilot key to Ctrl using AutoHotKey, but the keyboard backlight turns off too quickly, which is frustrating.\n* AI Features & Webcam: The AI eye contact feature is poorly executed, and the wide-angle webcam captures too much of my surroundings.\n* Glossy Display: It's highly reflective, which isn't ideal for bright environments.\n\n# Positives:\n\n* Stunning Design & Trackpad: The laptop looks sleek, almost like a MacBook, and the massive trackpad is so good that I hardly use a mouse.\n* Solid Hinge & Great Keyboard: The hinge is easy to open with one hand and feels premium, while the keyboard is clicky and visually appealing.\n* Outstanding Display: It's bright and colorful, with excellent HDR for movies.\n* Useful AI Features & Decent Speakers: The AI background blurring and noise cancellation work well, and the speakers are good for a laptop.\n* Convenient Charging & Good I/O: I can use my phone's USB-C charger, and there are multiple USB ports and useful features.\n\n# Performance:\n\nWhile I haven't tested it with games or benchmarks yet, the Acer is significantly faster than my ASUS for everyday tasks. It handles multiple apps smoothly, even on battery.\n\n# Battery Life:\n\nYou can't expect stellar battery life with a high-resolution H-series processor. I got around 5 hours of SOT with regular use and 4 hours while looping a 4K movie. There are ways to extend battery life, but I prefer using it to its full potential since it stays on my desk most of the time.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nFor the price I paid, I believe I found the best laptop for my needs. I'm very satisfied overall. **For the full review, check out my post** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcerOfficial/comments/1g75rhv/new_acer_swift_go_14_ai_pcs_review/).

Oh also, if you actually need to use windows, i’m not sure if windows even runs on ARM..?? (see link). And what about all those games/apps made for x64 or even older 32-bit? You’d have to research into Mac’s emulation. I would hope the x64 emulation is good, as it takes time to transition cpu architectures.. I personally just wouldn’t want to bother with all of this, so it better be dang good! The intel Macs was a good time imo, having Mac and windows run natively via boot camp. ARM, i have no idea.

Forcing people to buy a Mac product just to deploy to it is insane to me (though surely there’s a service for that now..).

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",

  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Help me choose a laptop for uni I don’t know which one to pick among these three laptops. I’m studying business while also working in content and graphic design, mostly 2D. The software I often use includes Microsoft Office, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, CapCut, Filmora, and Premiere.\n\nIf possible, I’d really appreciate it if you could recommend some ultrabooks or lightweight laptops under 15 inches. My budget is around $1000.",
  "Thinkbook, stay away from ideapads.",
  "How come? I don’t really know much about laptops, ppl said its a good deal",
  "Ideapads have generally terrible build quality and break after a year or two. Thinkbooks are built for small-medium sized business owners and are meant to last long.",
  "Tks. Appreciate that",
  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget €2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years. As longevity is important, I believe performance is an important criteria. My current setup is an 8th gen Intel i5 Asus laptop (8/256) and a M4 Mac Mini (24/512) on the desk. I want to replace both of these items with a single Windows laptop and I'll sell the Mac. I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around €2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. €1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. €1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. €1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. €2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. €2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** €2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",
  "Have you ruled out Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024 or 2025)? It is a cheaper Asus ProArt with the same of internals.  These Asus model carry the best speakers of all Windows laptops which is nice to have if you have kids or others to share a screen.",
  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",
  "Question: why are you listing high refresh rate laptops? Is that something you want?\n\nBecause I doubt you’ll max out that refresh rate in games unless you play older games or competitive online games.\n\nEdit: nvm just saw you don’t care about games.",
  "Have you considered a HP ZBook?",
  "T14 Thinkpads",
  "Update: Added the Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) to the list",
  "I did but seems a little difficult to find them not overly priced in Ireland.",
  "I'm doing some research on the P14s this morning.\n\nDirect from Lenovo I can get the Ultra 9 185H, no operating system, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 3K IPS display for €2370.\n\nA local retailer has the Ultra 9 185H, Win 11 Pro, 32GB RAM, 1TB performance SSD, 2560x1600 @ 90Hz display for €1790.\n\nI don't think the better display is worth €600.",
  "Also, unlike the ProArt you don't need to pay for a 4070 you said you wouldn't be using much. The 16:10 screen is also good for web development with it's bit of extra height. P1's are also pretty much the top of the Thinkpad scale, being workstation laptops and thus very solid. P1 gen 7 is also 17mm thick and 2kg so pretty portable.",
  "You're right, I never game but do appreciate a nice smooth screen. High refresh rate is not a must have but more a nice to have.",
  "I will take a look, thanks",
  "Thanks. A lot of praise online for Thinkpads",
  "Laptop for Casual Gaming and Work I am going to purchase a laptop for casual gaming and work. I need some opinions before I proceed, will appreciate if you can give some thoughts.\n\nMy main choice is ASUS TUF A14 (8845HS 16gb RAM 4060) for 1050$. I've done some research that its good. I like the build itself but something in me don't like the gaming font it uses (I know its a small issue but I'm still debating myself about this lol).\n\nAnother options I have are Vivobook S14 with latest CPU's and iGPU, Ideapad Pro 5 with 3050 (ranging in UAE for 1000 to 1400$) because of their builds and OLED screen. Good reviews as well.\n\nEDIT: Even checking also for Zenbooks and Yogas.\n\nWill I be missing out bigtime if I go for the looks rather than the performance, specs?",
  "Thoughts on this laptop deal?  Is this good value? Is the ryzen 7 worth the extra 100? I’ll be using it for university, I’m a journalist so lots of writing, some video and podcast editing then watching movies and some light gaming. Mainly emulating old games etc. Will this do the job? Is there a better value option out there? Thanks. ",
  "[removed]",
  "First one looks pretty good actually",
  "I have an ideapad 5 pro. I'm pretty happy with it except that doesn't have the keyboard of the legion that I had previously. It's got to brighten the screen at 350 nits and has like 98% sRGB. The RAM is soldered, so it's not upgradable. Based on the price in the advert, I suspect it might be last year's model, which is fine. They had a cheaper version with the GTX 1650 gpu.",
  "I have last year's IdeaPad 5 pro. I'm pretty happy with it. I think the one you are looking at is a good deal at that price. It has an OLED screen which is a nice upgrade. And a metallic case. Just keep on mind that this is not really a gaming computer because of the GPU and the cooling system. The RAM is soldered, so you cannot upgrade that.",
  "I'd personally prefer a lunar lake or strix point no dedicated gpu to a 3050 or 4050 laptop these days. Yes, some edge to the dgpu but not enough to justify the battery drain imo. I'm not sure what prices are for you though for most current chipsets.",
  "First one seems solid for the money and the fact its oled and above 1080p is honestly great for the money though just dont expect that 3050 to play modern games at high res with 60 fps",
  "Not good. There’s a Lenovo LOQ 15 with an i5-12450HZ and a 4060 for £799.99 on Amazon right now. Waaaaay better than the 3050. There’s also another model (shopping at Lenovo directly) with the same CPU but a 4050 at £668.80. Go to https://gaminglaptop.deals and select United Kingdom to see more deals like those. A 3050 Laptop in 2024 is not a good investment",
  "Yeah my budget is £700-900. Not really capable of going much higher. This laptop deal also allows me to pay it over 18 months without interest which is helpful. My other laptop that I’ve been looking at is a zen book 14. What would you go for out of the two?",
  "Yeah seems a bit too good to be true 🤣, I can pay it over 18 months without interest so that’s helpful as far as budget goes. I watched a review and it seems that it’ll even work for my light gaming as someone was pulling around 50-70 fps on both Baldurs gate and ghost of Tsushima. I was expecting much worse so that’s pretty decent.",
  "Does the 16gb ram do the job? Or do you think that’ll be too much of a hinderance. Also what’s your thoughts on the battery life?",
  "Also just want to ask, how portable is it?",
  "Yeah I was aware it wasn’t a gaming computer but it seems like it could do a decent job at some light gaming here and there. I wasn’t looking for anything too crazy on the gaming front",
  "What are some laptops that have the lunar lake?",
  "Would I be better just going for a dedicated graphics laptop for uni then? The gaming part wasn’t really my main focus that’s why I didn’t go for a strictly gaming laptop. I’m new to this lol",
  "Could you link the review please?",
  "It's a little heavy. It's also fairly thin. It does fit in a backpack.",
  "Very few atm unfortunately. ZenBook or IdeaPad.  Some other Asus and Lenovo models possibly ",
  "I recommended those basically because the ones you posted have dGPUs and you can find better hardware for similar prices, basically what I propose is doing the absolute best you can with your set budget.\n\nA better GPU would be better for video editing also, for example. It’s not only for gaming!",

  "Laptop Choices - ASUS Zenbook S vs ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition vs  Galaxy Book5 Pro Purchasing a new laptop for work/pleasure. Coming from a MBP, I value the sleek design and haptic trackpad, but need windows for work software. Battery life is not very important, will use my Ipad for travel media and have a desktop for my heavy workloads. Picked up a SL7, but having some compatibility issues with 3:2 and ARM windows.\n\nAfter narrowing my options down, I am looking at following three options. X9 is the only one with a haptic trackpad, but I hear the Zenbook trackpad has some good reviews. \n\nASUS Zenbook S 14\" Touchscreen Laptop (Intel Core Ultra 5 226V/16GB RAM/1TB SSD) - $1500 CAD\n\nThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition Intel 14’’ (Intel Core Ultra 5 238V/32GB Ram/256GB SSD) - $1700 CAD. I can either pay $124 more for 512gb SSD or upgrade 1-2TB after market. \n\nGalaxy Book5 Pro 14’’ (Intel Core Ultra 7 256V/16GB Ram/512GB SSD) - $1560 CAD\n\n  \nMy general idea is that all three will work wonders. Thanks in advance for any insight or recommendations moving forward!\n\n",
  "Would think the thinkpad would have the better build coming from an enterprise lineup, that and the extra RAM is nice. Yes you could toss in an SSD on your own. Of course this is the most expensive one. You could hold off Lenovo has sales on these all the time.",
  "I think all three are solid choices based on reviews from reputable sources. It all just comes down to personal preferences and picking whichever one has features you value most. I spent the last 2-3 months myself researching, trying out, and returning multiple laptops until I finally found one I liked. I finally picked the 14\" ThinkPad X9 in the end. For me it offered the best overall experience when it came to performance and features. The Sensel haptic touchpad and keyboard are just a joy to use on this thing, and the 2.8K 120Hz OLED display is probably the best I've seen on ANY laptop so far.\n\nI actually really wanted to like the Galaxy Book5 Pro badly (being a happy S25 Ultra owner), but unfortunately the shallow key travel on the keyboard drove me crazy the more time I spent with it. It slowed down my typing rate and made longer typing sessions very fatiguing. The touchpad also felt mediocre. I also discovered the Galaxy Book lineup was notorious for having cracked screens in the past... which seems like an odd issue to have since Samsung is world-renowned for their quality displays!\n\nAnyway, even though I didn't go with that model I hope Samsung really steps up their game with future Galaxy Book models. I really feel like they're capable of making laptops which can match the quality of their smartphones if they'd just try hard enough.",
  "Appreciate the feedback. I’m leaning toward the X9 ATM for sure. Out of curiosity, what other computers did you try?",
  "There's honestly way too much to list that I wouldn't be able to remember most of them...\n\nThe main brands I narrowed my search down to were Apple, ASUS, Lenovo, and Microsoft. Came real close to ordering the ROG Zephyrus G14, but there were enough negative reviews complaining about the rubber feet peeling off/becoming discolored, displays randomly dying/glitching out, and the touchpad being laggy. And I've heard some not so great things about ASUS customer service historically (don't know if they've improved since).\n\nGave the 14\" MacBook Pro a shot too. The hardware itself is great. I just don't like OS X. And this is coming from someone who has spent most of his life around Macs (up until shortly after graduating college 20 yrs ago). Don't know what it is about Apple now, but I feel like they've took a turn for the worst since Steve Jobs died. I've grown sick of their anti-consumer practices of peddling AppleCare just to get them to fix THEIR own known design flaws. I've fallen victim to it myself numerous times and I'm just done dealing with that.\n\nBy contrast you've got a company like Lenovo which ENCOURAGES owners to disassemble and replace components themselves. They even post easy to follow tutorial videos on their own support database. So that's part of the reason why they earned huge bonus points for me. The one crappy thing with Lenovo though is that they're Chinese owned, and with the trade war taking place now it's going to be interesting to see what future availability, pricing, and support is going to be like.\n\nI also ordered and tried out the Surface Laptop for Business. Overall build quality is on par with MacBooks, but it also the most expensive of the bunch.... setting me back over $2300 for the 13.8\" 268V model with 512GB SSD. The one I got became uncomfortably toasty just from the initial setup process and some light browsing. Something also felt off about the keyboard (noticeably mushier than the ThinkPad X9).",
  "Thanks for the write up. Pulled the trigger on the 14' X9 and hoping I am as happy with my decision as you are.",
  "Congrats! Hope you like it! Lenovo's return policy is pretty good if you end up not liking it or have issues with it. They'll give you a full refund after about a week (no restocking or return shipment fees).",
  "Please help!!! I may or may not go insane without your help ;) First, let me just say, until this I was totally and completely computer/electronic dumb. Well, I still am but now I know things, kinda. I have done so much research, and price and review comparison that I am now crosseyed and my brain is mush. I REALLY need all you IT/computer geniuses help. I've been at this for way to long.\n\nSo, My Dell inspiron 15 3000 10th gen i5 just suddenly stopped working 30 min before my 2nd round interview with a telehealth company (the charging port is messed up, I think? No issues of this variety previously and deleted most everything on it so my son could use it since I wasn't). I have always had problems with it being unbearably slow and not loading stuff. More than a few times I have almost tested it to see how far it could fly when thrown from a 2nd story window. So I am needing a new one. I need something fast that I can run EMR programs when traveling and working from hotels or motocross tracks on occasion (The companies usually provide my equipment for home) and I need something I can edit photos and video, do spreadsheets and bookkeeping and I am that person that constantly has 100 tabs open at all times, ok that's an exaggeration, currently I only have 10 google pages and 4 programs open, but I have only been on my desktop for a few hours, I will definitely have more open shortly, no need to worry, haha.\n\nAnyway, from what I've read for remote healthcare work I need MINIMUM 16GB 512GB SSD and an i5 to run the programs efficiently, but an i7 or Ultra i7 is prefered, and need a webcam and good speakers/microphone. I have to have the number pad but am more than ok using a normal keyboard if needed and I will use an actual mouse so the touchpad sensitivity or whatever isn't a consideration. The sites i looked at for best laptops for medical workers never mentioned the AMD Ryzen, but I am not sure how old they were. Their #1 pick was either a macbook or surface pro, but I work in healthcare so I can't afford those and I am not an apple user/fan, but I could consider one if its best.\n\nAfter hours and hours and even more hours I thought I had it narrowed down to a Lenovo ideapad or an Asus Vivobook S with Ultra i7. When I went to buy the Asus the price went back up to over $750 (was on sale for $638) and so I did even more comparison shopping/research and I just can't get over the people saying the Asus's are junk. So I am leaning back towards a lenovo. I would rather have a thinkpad or x1 Carbon but I think I would have to get refurbished. I have a thinkcentre desktop that was refurbished and it has been awesome aside from a glitch here and there (it was $200 so expected to have an issue or 2), but I have had horrible luck with refurbished laptops, so it makes me nervous. Then my son who is preparing for college for coding and programing tells me that every Lenovo he's used has been junk (school provided laptops) and that HP has really gone down hill and aren't like they used to be, but Asus are good gaming laptops and that the AMD are pretty good depending on the generation and specs. He is also a know it all 18yr old but he's a smart lil s#!t, so I listen sometimes, only on occasion. Now though I don't know what is good, what will work for my needs and what I should flat out ignore.\n\nNow here's the kicker....drum roll..... I absolutely cannot spend over $800. Preferably between $500-$700. I have the jist of what to look for but I start going brain dead when comparing SDRAM vs DRAM, graphics and 802.11ax vs Infrared. Ummmm.... yep, one of those is what I need, I think.....\n\nPlease PLEASE help me. I have another interview via Teams on Friday and no laptop and no webcam. I am ok with replacing in a few years but would like it to at least last 5 years, and without a lot of decline in performance. I have tried so hard to find the best laptop to replace my Dell and my desktop with my budget on my own but I can't find a lot on the AMD ryzen aside from it seems to have less cores/threads and I don't know which brand is good anymore. Oh and I also have caviar taste on a top ramen budget, so there is also that. I am a 40 year old mom whos never needed a computer for more than school.\n\nSorry for the word vomit, just wanted to make sure I included as much info as possible. Thank you for your help. It is really truly appreciated.",

When your poor with expensive tastes and ADHD and OCD, its just not that simple. I have to make sure I am getting the absolute best I can for the money, and that its not cheaper or have better deal somewhere else. It just took us 6mths to buy a used work car under 10K. I have issues, lol. I knew all the minimum specs I needed and knew somethings where more important than others. What was making me lose my mind was Brand and AMD Ryzen or Ultra i-- or just i---. One website says Dell with a Ryzen 7 the next say their POS get a Asus Ultra 7. So ya its just not that easy for weirdos like me. The Ryzen thing was really throwing me off. The rtings site help because it listed all the major laptops for that range and how it rated in each category. I understand charts, lists, and numbers. Data. Reading through reviews and opinion I spiral and will make buying a pair of shoes seem like the biggest investment of my life.",

  "This is used, ask the seller if they ship to India and if not, you can use a freight forwarder like MyUS if the seller allows it:\n\n[https://www.ebay.com/itm/256810297126](https://www.ebay.com/itm/256810297126)\n\nThough it is used, it is open-box and is under your budget whilst ticking all of your boxes, iGPU from the CPU should be enough for running multiple windows of VSCode and other coding applications and power efficient enough for a decent battery life.\n\nComes with a 3K OLED 120Hz screen, can lower to 1080p for coding and for the occasional gaming and 3K for content consumption (it is NOT a gaming laptop but the iGPU should be powerful enough for [light 1080p gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs0tPnmkIVg) and more than enough for schoolwork).\n\nAlso comes with 24GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, which should be sufficient for coding workloads and files too.\n\nThe price in Rupees is 77,679.03INR as of writing, the 23k leeway should be enough to cover shipping to India.\n\nIf you want the best bang-for-buck, used is the best way to go, and eBay has very good buyer protection in case anything goes wrong. I recommend if you do buy the laptop to record your unboxing and testing of the laptop upon unboxing as evidence in case there are issues with the laptop.\n\nAlso, I would recommend spending your extra budget on thermal pads (PTM 7950 is tried and tested) for your CPU for better thermals and slightly better battery life (lower temps), and reinstalling Windows 11 once you receive the laptop to get rid of bloatware.\n\nLastly, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts) to activate your fresh W11 copy without buying a key (you can check it's legitimacy, I used it myself to activate Windows on both my PC and laptop).\n\nHope this helps!\n\nP.S.

  "Need a system for productivity, VM work, and light gaming with good battery I get into a lot of network simulation like GNS3 and EveNG to run network devices and systems VMs. I also am taking some online ethical hacking courses that uses a lot of VMs for Linux and windows. I don’t like staying plugged in all the time, so I’m trying to find a good mix.\n\nLast year i bought the Yoga Slim 9i 16” and it was fantastic except the battery. That was a joke. It would die with casual use within 2-3 hours or less, and that was with me turning down settings and going to 60hz. If that’s how it needs to be used, what’s the point of all the extra power and features? So I sold it. My 15” MacBook Air M2 has been working out for productivity, but I really need a Windows system back for my VM and simulation stuff. I also miss gaming a little here and there. \n\nI am just not sure what will end up being more important to me feature wise (screen, weight, battery, dGPU etc). I am looking at three systems and leaning towards AMD for battery life, but the Core Ultra 9 185h has more cores for VM work and seems to do ok on battery depending on the system. I also love a good screen, but I don’t do a lot of media consumption really. I don’t know I will actually take advantage of miniLED/OLED or not.\n\nThree systems:\nLenovo Yoga Pro 9 w/o miniLED 32Gb, Intel 185H, 4050 (IPS version is on sale for 1299 at Best Buy. The miniLED version is $600 more because it isn’t on sale, and that’s too much extra)\nLenovo Thinkpad P16s Gen 2 w/ 7840u, 64gb ram, 1tb SSD, 4k OLED 60hz New in Box for $910 (AMD does ok casual gaming, so no dGPU is ok but I kinda prefer one)\nLenovo Ideapad Pro 5 w/ Intel Ultra 9 185H, 32Gb ram, 4050, 2k OLED 120hz refurbished for $850. (Has mixed reviews and a loud track which can annoy me)\n\nI am also trying to stick to under $1500.\n\nIf anybody else knows of something, my needs are:\n16” Nice screen w/ higher resolution (doesn’t have to be 4k) don’t care about high refresh rate on laptops. I’ve had it, and it didn’t much for me.\n32-64GB of ram (VMs take up a lot of ram)\nMany CORES (Ultra 9 has more than 8840U or HS, but not sure how much that will impact VM use)\nGood battery life without having to make it feel like a $300 laptop in features.\nNumberpad - Inputting IP address on a top row of keys is horrible. I have to do that some when i work remote for my job since my work laptop is 14”\n\nThere are a ton of options that fit all of this except battery life. It sucks to constantly worry about plugging in to keep working. I wanted the new Ryzen Ai 370 but there are no systems that meet my criteria except one new MSi system that is priced too high for the specs. I wish I didn’t want the numpad, but I really need it.\n",

  "Is it difficult to install an operating system (windows 11) yourself? I needed to buy a new laptop and I spent a few weeks looking and I just could not settle on one. I do have a student discount with Lenevo, so I wanted to use that. So I wanted a good processor, 16 or 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, with a few ports with an IPS screen.\n\nIt seems like I can't have everything without compromising on something.\n\nI quite like the ideapad pro 5, AMD version was €860 and intel version was €993 for a 14\" OLED screen. But I didn't want an OLED screen. These two laptops were in my top 3 in the end. I could get an IPS screen if I choosed the 16\" laptop and I was seriously considering it but then I was going over my budget of €1000 and it didn't help that reading people's reviews online and something breaking on their Lenevo laptop after a few months.\n\nThen I remembered my phone brand does laptops (Xiaom), so I looked at the laptops online and I found exactly what I wanted, the redmibook 14 pro with a good processor (I hope), it's an intel core ultra 7 155H, intel arc graphics, 80Wh battery, 14\" LCD screen with good resolution, usb-c, thunderbolt, hdmi, 2xUSB, 2 stereo speakers for €1349 from a European store. I have a redmi phone which is fantastic, so I would expect their laptops would be too, so I didn't mind going over budget. There was no picking and choosing like you get on the Lenevo site unless I wanted an intel core 5 125H processor.\n\nThen I saw a review online from someone in Germany and they were able to get the laptop from China for under €900 So I pulled the trigger on the laptop. The laptop comes with the Chinese version of windows and the review said to purchase windows in your language. So I also bought windows 11 with English. And this was all for €957 in total including a mouse. So that's not bad at all. \n\nSo as far as I know I need to install windows myself and I bought it with my laptop, so not sure if I'm getting a key or a disc or USB to install from.\n\nSo just wondering is it easy to install windows and what about drivers?",
  "Normally you can go to settings - Time and language and then add a preferred language and then you can change your display language.\n\nMy laptop came with French and I just added the English Language and changed it to my display language. (There is no French (English) option)\n\nI don't know about Chinese though but usually Microsoft allow you to install additional languages that you can use as the display language, same with the keyboard. You usually have to reboot though after adding to get it to appear in Display Language.\n\n  \nOf course it will be much better just to clean install Windows in the English display language. Drivers should be available from Xiaomi (Redmi) and if not you can usually get them from Intel or 3rd party sites (If you are really struggling to find them). Windows Update will install some of them.",
  "1 return the windows license because you can just change the language or reinstall\n\n2 try to set it up and use your language\n\n3 if you cant just reinstall with a USB stick\n\nyes its very easy and free",
  "It's a bit strange how a laptop comes in only one language. I was on the Mi Chinese page and there's instructions on how to set up your laptop and how to install windows and you can change the language during setup. I had to use Google translate but it's there. So probably you can change the language but the man in the review didn't know Chinese so didn't know what to do so only said the laptop was in one language and couldn't be changed. I don't know Chinese either but I'll use Google translate during setup where I can point my camera on my phone at a different language and it will translate it.\n\nProblem with this, I might be left with some Chinese app or something which I don't want anyways. So I might do a clean install.",
  "Apparently, I can't change the Chinese language on the laptop. So that leaves me with installing windows to English.",
  "Personally... I would clean install. I have ordered Xiaomi Phones before now from China and the first thing I do is install the Global or EU ROM on them but I think the Phone software is a little different.\n\n  \nCreate your installation Media from the Microsoft Site, get your product key ready and then you are all set. Sure you might lose some of the exclusive customizations but I would imagine in your case most of them will only be relevant in China market anyway.\n\n  \nI think it will be easier than setting the language to English and then going through everything to see what is useful and what is not.",

  "Gaming laptops heat issues Looking on the Lenovo web store for LOQ options I came across the new Ideapad Pro 5 that has RTX 3050 graphic card (16\" has upgrade option of 4050). The machine is slim, all metal, runs a Ryzen 7 cpu, and doesnt appear to have anywhere near the vents that a LOQ has.

  "Is an Ultra 7 155H (vs 8845HS) and 32Gb RAM worth a 362€ extra cost? I'm basically trying to decide which laptop to choose among these two (battery life in mind):\n\n**IdeaPad Pro 5 14 gen 9:** 899€  \nRyzen 7 8845HS, 16GB 6400Mhz, 2880 x 1800 OLED 120Hz, 84Wh\n\n**MSI Prestige 13 AI EVO A1MG-024ES:** 1262€  \nUltra 7 155H, 32GB 6400Mhz, 2880 x 1800 OLED 60Hz, 75Wh\n\nAlthough the MSI has more ram, the Ideapad has a substantially bigger battery (+12%), is 362€ cheaper and (although less important for me)  has a 120Hz refresh screen.\n\nSo it all comes to whether the Ultra 7 155H is worth those extra 362€ and if its power efficiency compensates for the compensates for the -12% battery capacity.\n\nWhat would you choose if it was for you? Thank you in advance.\n\nPD: I know there are other differences like weight, SSD capacity, etc... they're not priorities for me. And when it comes to reviews, everyone says wonders about the MSI, but there are not many reviews for the Ideapad so its hard to compare.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1cmf7cu)",
  "Generally, performance is very similar between these 2, although most \"real world\" benchmarks tend to favor the Ryzen, while artificial benchmarks tend to favor the Core Ultra.  Either way, there's not a TON of difference either way.\n\niGP, again, there's not much to choose between them.  The RX780M and Arc Xe 8 are extremely similar in performance.  Ultimately performance will be determined by what you're using to benchmark, but overall, the Arc should be some insanely slight amount better across a huge suite of benchmarks.\n\nEfficiency, from what little I've seen of both, there's again, very similar despite that the Ryzen, in theory, is higher wattage than the Intel (35w base with TDP-up configurable to 54w vs. 28w).\n\nSo, with efficiency being so similar, battery life should definitely be improved in the IdeaPad.  The 120Hz refresh will hurt it some, but since they're both already OLED and going to get horrible battery life due to that, the difference in 60Hz vs. 120Hz will be negligible.\n\nSo IMO, does your workflow benefit from the extra ram?  If so, the Intel may be worth it depending on how long you plan on keeping it.  If not, then the Lenovo is definitely the superior choice with better battery life and a lower price.",

  "Confused about which laptop to buy Hi everyone\n\nI am an engineering grad student and I want to buy a windows laptop for my work ( mostly ). but I keep getting more confused about which laptop to buy. My first choice was the Asus Zenbook 14, which I read multiple negative reviews of it's bad performance and some motherboard issues. My other candidate was some Lenovo Thinkpad Carbon( which is expensive ) Thinkpad P or T series, or Yoga 7i, which I read they also have some quality issues as the are made in China ( I just read the reviews, I never had a lenovo before). Then I found HP x360 2024 amazing due to its portability and use of newest gen of Intel chip, and guess what? when I searched its name, there was an essay of why these specific HP laptops are bad and have issues ( the post was from someone who claimed to be a former HP tech guy).\n\nIn conclusion, I want to buy a Laptop which is \n\n1. portable ( I have to carry it around everywhere, so the charger brick's weight also counts)\n2. Have good performance ( I use softwares for rendering and calculation, like heavy matlab tasks), so the RAM is also important. ( having the option to upgrade the device would be great )\n3. I am a bit concerned about the PWM of displays and it made me hesitate about buying an OLED panel )\n4. The battery life is also a thing, but not as important as the fan noise ( imagine being in a meeting and your laptop is louder than your supervisor )\n5. I have zero to no knowledge about the integrated graphics, but I heard the for an OLED panel its better to have a dedicated graphics. also for rendering I think dedicated graphics are better as you can assign a task to specific GPU core.\n\nRight now I am using an old Asus ROG from 6 years ago, and Its finally the time for retiring the old soldier.\n\nMy candidates for laptops are as mentioned:\n\n1. HP specter x360 (2024)\n2. Ideapad pro 5i\n3. Asus Zenbook 14 or 14pro\n4. Lenovo Yoga 7i (2024)\n5. Asus Zypherus g14 (2024 or 2023, I still don't know)\n6.

  "Choosing between Regular Laptop and Laptop with dedicated GPU - Is the fan noise too much for a classroom? I'm a student looking for a laptop under in the budget range $500-900 for coding, classes and everyday use. I don't play games, but an NVIDIA GPU would help me with CUDA programming. Currently, I rely on my university's cluster, which makes debugging a bit cumbersome. \n\nI had initially chosen the [Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-500/ideapad-pro-5i-gen-8-16-inch-intel/83aq000qus) since it fits my budget and doesn't look like a bulky gaming laptop. \n\nHowever, I've come across many comments and reviews that any laptop with a dedicated GPU can be noisy, have poor battery life, get too hot to touch, and so on. \n\nI hope you guys could answer these questions:\n\n* Do these issues still apply even if I'm not using the GPU and have the computer on a light load?\n* Would the laptop noisy enough that I would not be able to use it in classes without disturbing others?\n* I also have 4 hours of classes on some days and want a minimum battery life of 5 hours. The laptop has a 75Wh battery, how well does that translate to battery life?\n* Is there a way to switch off features that are not being used to reduce these issues?\n* Are there other issues with laptops with dedicated GPU's that I don't know about?\n\nI'm wondering if these potential downsides would outweigh the convenience of having an onboard NVIDIA GPU, and whether I'd be better off getting a regular laptop and continue using the university clusters instead.

  "Help me decide on my next laptop I recently purchased a 4K monitor to hook up to my laptop. My laptop is pretty ancient and unfortunately is not capable of displaying 3840 x 2160 on the monitor. So i've been looking around to upgrade the laptop which was probably due anyway.\n\nI mostly use my computer for internet, YouTube, Twitch and some work stuff on MS Office and occasional coding (nothing complex at this stage). I don't need anything resembling a gaming laptop although would appreciate some good speakers if I watch something on the computer.\n\n\\- Screen size is important to me and I would like to stick with 15.6 inch, or go to 16 inch. I am used to a matte screen and some of the glossy screens I have seen seem to suffer from glare / reflective which puts me off from going glossy.- I would prefer to have a number pad on the keyboard too.- Longevity: I would like something which will last me at least 5 years so am going for 16GB RAM.- **Must be able to display 4K resolution when connected to my 4K monitor**\n\nAfter much looking around I think I have narrowed my search down to the below choices. I have concerns about each and hopefully someone can help :) I should add that the Samsung and Lenovo are both similar in price.\n\n\\- **Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro**: It has an i7-1260P CPU, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, HDMI 2.0, Thunderbolt ports. The computer is thin and light, it has a number pad. The speakers are decent sounding. The computer is perfect for my requirements except the **screen**. The screen is a glossy AMOLED panel displaying 1920 x 1080 at 60hz. In the store I found it a bit reflective. The major concern is whether it will suffer from dead pixels and burn-in which I have read can happen with OLED displays and maybe I should stick with an LCD / IPS screen. The computer comes with a **1 year warranty** so after that I am at risk. [Samsung](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/samsung-galaxy-book2-pro-15.6-laptop-intel-core-i7-512-gb-ssd-silver-10236963.html)\n\n\\- **Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro**:  It has an AMD Ryzen 5, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 16\" WQXGA+ displaying 2560 x 1600 and I believe up to 120hz, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 4GB GPU. I believe the computer has a matte display and a number pad. Reviews generally seem to be good. Some comments that it runs a bit noisy. The ports are not as good as on the Samsung. When I search for information on the product there's some mixed messaging about the **HDMI**. The following link states it's HDMI 2.0 and so does Lenovo site. Some of the YouTube reviews said it's 1.4b which means it wouldn't be able to display 4K at 60hz - they could be wrong of course. Some reviews mention the computer shuts down after going to sleep - i'm not sure if this is user error or can't be changed. The Lenovo comes with a **2 year warranty**. [Lenovo](https://www.johnlewis.com/lenovo-ideapad-5-pro-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-16-inch-wqxga-storm-grey/p6404704)\n\n\\- **Dell XPS 15:** I could maybe push the budget and stretch to an XPS 15 with an i7 processor and 16GB RAM. If I buy new unused from the outlet and use a discount code. The panel is glossy but meant to have anti-glare on it. There's no number pad which is disappointing. Unlike the Samsung and Lenovo, the RAM is not soldered and can be upgraded in future.  I have read reviews about it being a bit unreliable, overheating, the fans running often to cool the computer.\n\nIf you have made it this far, I really appreciate the time and any advice / guidance which you can offer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8lwxwaqa1ua1.jpg?width=1325&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbfe1eca2126ceb8b536b4966f3bc4c25773fa3c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/schfmx2oa1ua1.jpg?width=943&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=930a67235c99a5ddc2496baa67a71d06be3921f5",

  "What are good laptops for gaming & work under 1500€? Looking for a laptop which would be good both for gaming and working, preferably 16GB RAM. Built in CD/DVD reader is a must. RGB keyboard would be a plus but would be survivable without it as well. It would be neat if the cost was ~1200€ but I'd be able to afford up to 1500€ or around that. I won't be able to buy a new computer in the next few years so it is very important for me to pick the best one within my price range. \n\nI understand nothing else besides RAM when it comes to computer specifics, so what are the things I should pay more attention to?\n\nThe most common brands here are ASUS&Lenovo, are those any good? I used to have HP laptop, it was kinda slow and bugged for gaming, fine for work. \n\nThe ones in my price range I have seen the most offers for are the following : \n\nLENOVO IdeaPad 5 PRO 16ACH6 \n\nASUS ROG Zephyrus M16 GU603HE-KR040T \n\nASUS ROG Strix G15 G513RM-HF148W (i like the design, however it is pricy...)\n\nI've also seen plenty of offers for ACER NITRO 5, but some reviews hinted that this one was not very good for work, which would be a no 🤔\n\nOf course, other models are fine as well, would be harder to find them - but not impossible.",

  "Are you mainly going to use the device docked somewhere to an power outlet or do you expect battery life and best mobility? There are some German Tongfeng Notebooks I could recommend you where you get 12th gen i7 with RTX 3060 and 32GB Ram or upwards. Though those are 17 inches big and are powerhouses. More like mobile Desktop replacements  instead of efficient notebooks.",
  "Ah, I see.. few years ago a big part of laptops did include a cd player, didn't think that would change.. Thank you for the information!",
