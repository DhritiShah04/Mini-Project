  "Guys is this genuine? Like seriously 1 rupees? ",
  "likely a phishing page, open a new tab type \"store.lenovo.com\" manually and make sure it's still in your cart there",
  "Proceed with caution. For that price, I'd say to just go ahead and buy it and see what happens, considering you're on [store.lenovo.com](http://store.lenovo.com), but I'm still very suspicious about it. There's no reason they'd actually sell anything for that price, unless it was a mistake on the website. However, if it is a mistake and it lets you place the order, it's possible that they might still honor the purchase and just eat the loss as a result of their mistake and still send it to you. It looks like the actual Lenovo website. Look closely at the URL, and type in the Lenovo website URL manually and navigate there directly to make sure you're at the right place. If you still see it there, maybe try and see if it lets you order.",
  "Try and find . Pay 1 rupee",
  "If this is real some intern finna be fired",
  "Could be an accident. \n\nI found an issue on HPs website once and got some accessory stuff for Penny's on the dollar.",
  "Already seen that on the Lenovo Page. They released a new device and instead of 2000€ it said 200€ the Order got canceled. Might be mistakes or Intention to get intention",
  "Looks like a scam",
  "Whenever I Google the Indian version of Lenovo's website, it takes me to lenovo.com/in/.\n\nFeels like a scam. If you have a prepaid debit/credit card, it may be worth trying. I wouldn't give any information linked to my bank if I were you.",
  "I have orderd 2 of them at 2 rupees , lets see what happens,  haha",
  "Show us the whole url.\n\nIf that's phishing, all they needed were your payment credentials.",
  "Well Rupees are a fictional currency from The Legend of Zelda video game series so I’d say it isn’t genuine.",
  "Next time just order it and don't post it on places like this",
  "they brought the store down since",

  "Go for it, the worst that can happen is you lose 1 rupee, the best outcome, you effectively get a free laptop, just make sure to use a single use card number (like zip pay single use card, or something similar)",
  "Use a throw away card from Walmart",
  "Check the website, yours might be fake.",
  "Make sure it's the actual site 1st and not just some phishing website to take your credentials and payment information",
  "How?\n\n**Edit:** I found the same bug. Placed an order. Few minutes later some guys from the store called and said they cannot sell it for ₹1 and cancelled the order.",
  "1 rupee and you still asking \"is this genuine\" how old are u boy?",
  "i think OP has done inspect element   \nhe just wanted some attention",

  "Checked. Website is genuine, having Google sign in option as well. The item looks like a wrong entry.. They will correct it and cancel orders before shipping.",
  "I haven't seen any malware that attacks android phones and modify the webpage content / hosts file to redirect you to a phishing page. Looks like a real website, but the pricing is definitely a glitch, which they would either honor it as another redditor mentioned, or cancel the order if you place it. Yet - the company has all rights to cancel an order at anytime and refund you the money. \n\n  \nI'd go for it and see what happens if I were you, no harm in losing a rupee. Virtual cards are best, I remember SBI had this feature at least 10 years ago but not sure now. Proceed with due diligence.",

  "Scam Alert ❗❗❗",
  "Why is that website so sketchy?  Visiting from the US and it still gives me info as if I'm in India?",
  "First you should paste the link so that other users go try it out. \nSecond you buy it and choose the shipping method as STORE PICKUP. \nLastly DON'T GIVE ANY BANK DETAILS EVEN IT'S FREE (they surely want consumers to prepay it).",
  "Not too sure but could of just been a fuck up on their end when pricing. Had it happen a few times on websites, once at JD sports with some AF1 marked down to $20 instead of $200 but they ended up refunding everyone lol and once with a skate deck that was FREE, again they just emailed me saying lol no 😂",

  "I have bad vision but it can’t be this bad to see 1 rupee",
  "It seriously went out of stock lmao",
  "What's the harm in trying bro",
  "Make sure that's really the store site (security certificate and all that).  It might be bait to get you to enter your credit card details.",
  "I guess not..",
  "For me it shows 137k",
  "I think it depends on your country's law system. For example, in Mexico, we have a consumer protection enforcer, which forces the seller to honor their stated price, even in case of human error or similar snafus. This has led to several incredible bargain stories over the years.",
  "Share us the laptop link",
  "I checked it. does show just 1 but currently out of stock. Update us OP",
  "[deleted]",
  "This happened with me too and then they cancelled the order after 2 days",

  "Any updates?",

  "Did you buy it or not?",
  "https://privacy.com\n\nNo reason to not give it a go. Use a burner card from above. First twelve each month are free.",
  "It’s an obvious scam jfc",
  "It's out of stock now 😭",
  "Better order 10 more",
  "Keep us updated OP!",
  "Bro at least sign in \nThen check the price",
  "That website looks suspicious to me.Your card might get blocked or u might get scammed.Lenovo website is secured website while the website you are showing is not secured.I would not make the payment.",

  "So any update?",
  "In Germany it's a different shop. https://www.lenovo.com/de/de/d/sale/\n\nI would be careful",
  "They just want your bank details. Check at the end of website is it really lenovo website or a fake one",
  "i often buy mispriced products on aliexpress, and about 30% of the time i actually get them.",
  "Update us if it gets delivered",
  "They didn’t honour their error in my experience. I purchased a machine on a fantastic sale. The website said that they had it in stock. They in fact did not have it in stock. I only learned this after a month of waiting for it to arrive and it being in the ready to ship stage, still showing that they had stock. When the error was discovered they offered to cancel my order and find a machine that “fit” my needs at whatever price they were selling it at. No, I wanted a machine with the closest specifications at the price that I ordered and paid for the first one that you said you had in stock. They didn’t budge at all. I ordered a machine at $250, the next one that had the closest specifications was $750. The original price of the machine I ordered was $950. Some brands are better than others when it comes to errors. Lenovo isn’t one of them.",
  "i dont remember lenovo's official site looking like this. There was no green color, all the accents were black or red in my memory",
  "I had the same bug on the HP website, €1 for a computer that is worth €1,400, I paid but after a few hours my order was cancelled. They'll probably do the same to you, it must be a bug in the site.",
  "Order it I guess but pay with PayPal or something",
  "Could be a pricing error too. Order it",
  "Which store was it?",
  "Get one for me 😜",
  "If the website is legitimate I'd fuck around and find out 😂",
  "Is store.Lenovo.com strictly for India? I’m in Canada and it’s showing me rupees",
  "What do you fucking think?",
  "Well probably a key logger that want's your card details.",
  "Just create an internet bank account, deposit a small amount of money and purchase it. Simple, end of story.",
  "Yeah, genuinely stealing your personal information.",
  "Could be a price mistake. If you want try it out with a safe payment method",

  "obviously not legit. \n\nThe real website link is lenovo.com\n\nnot site.lenovo.com",
  "Plot twist...\n\nOP made this site so people go and buy/log in and THEY are now stealing your info. This seems way to scummy/scammy. \n\nWeblink isn't true. Copied page.",
  "Be careful could be a wrong Site or sometimes Like Amazon a Price Tag was wrong I could buy it but often the offer was then canceld",
  "Seems like that one incident where the gas prices were mistaken at a station and one comma was off (10 times cheaper price).\n\nAnd some dude was filling like the back of his truck with gasoline. Not sure how specific the action was, but basically they were taking advantage of the situation.",
  "RUN",
  "SCAM!!!!",
  "Purchasing a product at the advertised price isn't illegal. Not selling you a product for the advertised price is illegal in a lot of places. Hopefully in your country too.",
  "Use a burner card if you can. Doesn't hurt to try it.",
  "Is like one of those amazon errors where some products are like 1 dollar",
  "Send me the full link pls",
  "Well this is because the prices are set by the individual store owners. Something like that happened with me too. A laptop I wanted to buy was showing for 50% less at only one lenovo store. It was hella skeptical. I contacted that store and they clarified that is not the correct price and will be changed that morning. ",

  "Link ?",
  "Link ?\n\nIf possible let us know if order",
  "Well, it's been 3 days, have you purchased it already? If so then no problem but if you're still planning to, then I would say they likely have corrected this mistake by now, or even earlier, like 10 hours after you saw it",
  "Might as well give it a shot lol",
  "Link shared by OP seems to be individual local store link and they are free to set their prices so someone probably made a typo.

  "Yeah I'm sure that's much more likely than a simple pricing mistake that happens all the time and would never ship",
  "This is what I'm thinking. Not that they'd do it intentionally, but the order would probably just get entered into their automated system to process it and the request to package and ship the laptop would be passed into their fulfillment/shipping department and someone there might ship it, not knowing or caring what people paid for anything.",
  "Yea, like my dad saw a wrong price on jbls site, 0 euro soundbar, and he ordered one, but then he ordered 15 more. Im pretty sure thats the reason that they catched it. A while ago i saw a wrong price on jbls site, 25 euros for a flip 4 camo. I ordered one and actually recieved it",
  "Most likely true. I work at a very large company and work in picking and shipping orders, and it's generally the same for every company. If a product is in stock and is purchased, the order is automatically added to the queue and dropped in the next wave of orders for the warehouse workers to pick and ship it. \n\nMany times the packlist/order receipt will show the total price of the order, but nobody really pays attention and even if a warehouse grunt sees it, they will assume nothing and still send it out. No managers or financial workers will see the order until well after it is shipped and delivered in most cases",
  "I have worked at a popular grocery store for over a decade. In the U.S. if a store has a price sign in front of a product that indicates an incorrect price, we have to honor it. Otherwise it’s called bait and switch. I have no idea how this is handled online or internationally however.",
  "They don’t. Law undergraduate here. This falls under contract law. A website listing or product is considered as an **invitation to treat**, and not an **offer**. To define an offer, I will quote it from the case of Preston Corpn Sdn Bhd v Edward Leong: An offer is an intimation of willingness by an offeror to enter into a legally binding contract. Its terms either expressly or impliedly must **indicate** that it is to **become binding on the offeror** (buyer) assoon as it has been **accepted by the offeree** (seller).\n\nEven if the customer were to send an offer (by checking out), a **binding contract** is not yet formed because Lenovo has yet to accept that offer and they can choose to back out as there is no **legally enforceable agreement** yet. (A confirmation email is also not signifying of acceptance of order!)\n\nA similar example to this would be Chwee Kin Keong v Digiland Mall Pte Ltd. TLDR is that an employee keyed in a pricing for a product at $66 instead of $3,854 (MSRP) and the company obviously didn’t want to fulfil orders that were made and got taken to court. Court ruled in the company’s favour.\n\nIn consumer court, courts do consistently rule in favour of the seller during obvious pricing mistakes like a $1 phone etc. because they take the view of a **reasonable person in consideration and apply the objectivity test**. \n\nFor example, in this case, the court said:\n“I find ... that the plaintiffs, given each of their backgrounds, would in any event, each have separately realised and appreciated, before placing their purchase orders,that a manifest mistake had occurred – even if no communications on the error had taken place between them. Further, the character of the mistake was such that **any reasonable person** similarly circumstanced as each of the plaintiffs would have had every reason to believe that a manifest error had occurred.” . \n\nOtherwise, the court would also simply treat it as a **clerical or unilateral mistake** and not punish the seller. Similarly in this case, Lenovo would win.\n\nIf there’s any Law graduates reading this and want to improve on my stand, please do! I’m still studying and open to improvement",
  "Nope where it's clearly a mistake and you know it, they don't need to honour it",
  "They are not and three seconds of googling will support that. Just because you once managed to slip one through doesn’t mean that’s the law.\n\nImagine a computer store mislabelling a €4000 laptop at €1 and a large amount of units are ordered overnight while nobody’s at work. Your argument is that EU law now effectively forces this company into bankruptcy by being required to honor these sales that were clearly made exploiting an error in pricing?",
  "No....",
  "Depends on the Ts and Cs",
  "Yeah.... depends on if that's enforceable to a website in another country.... Much like the GDPR fines the EU charges.... a US website isn't subject to that....  even if they decide to keep data on you... because they're not breaking THEIR laws.",

It's server-client thing – client sends response (get/post etc.), site's backend transfers specific data to the client (rendering the page if needed and so on). Done.",

  "We don't. Webshops have to honor the order, unless the error they made was big enough for the buyer to know beforehand that is was a typo. So in this case, yes, they would not have to honor it, but they have to honor the agreement generally when you purchase something on their website.",
  "True, but I was just giving an example to explain. However, if we look at it in layman terms, the universal legal principle will be the same. You simply cannot reasonably expect to enforce a contract based on a price that is **obviously an error**. So in any jurisdiction, I’m highly confident that Lenovo would win should this be taken to court. \n\nIf you search up similar topics, you will find that across common law (Singapore, UK, US) and civil law (France, Germany, EU), the courts follow the same reasoning:\n1.\tObvious pricing errors = no binding contract.\n2.\tBuyers cannot exploit a mistake they recognize.\n3.\tThe worst that happens to the retailer is refunding the money.\n\nHowever, if we are referring to say, a $599 MSRP laptop being listed erroneously at $499, the court may order the seller to honor some of the orders, which has happened in many jurisdictions before, since borderline errors (e.g., 10–25% off normal price) can be interpreted as a discount/promotion and would lead a reasonable person to believe that there is no mistake in pricing.\n\nIn this case though, it’s a laptop for $1. So it’s pretty obvious and no court would side with the buyer.",
  "Incorrect.\nTL;DR Lenovo (and most other companies) explicitly states that a confirmation email does **NOT** signify acceptance of the order. **No acceptance = No contract.** (This clause is commonplace for every business) Consumer will lose if he tries to go to court, even if he has the best lawyer. Below, I will cite Lenovo.\n\n**Full explanation:**\n\nA confirmation email, if you dig deep into any businesses’s Terms and Conditions (the thing that everyone ignores), has built in protective clauses in their Terms of Sale, and they’re not obliged to provide the consumer with any goods or service with a confirmation email alone. **Confirmation email ≠ acceptance.** A confirmation email only signifies that they have **received** the order.\n\nHere, I will specifically cite for this case, Lenovo. Under their T&Cs, it clearly states that **a confirmation of Lenovo receiving and/or processing your order does not constitute acceptance of the order.** (1.2)\n\nSource: https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/legal/new-products-and-warranty-services/?srsltid=AfmBOop9YcXqtlgbWWSEtLd4WCy7paTFtCMABKIs8xZmfYyPvIBRyTbc&ut\n\nIt also states under 1.1 that:\n\n1.1) **No contract** for the purchase of Products or Services will be formed until Lenovo accepts your Order by **one of the following**:\n\n**(a)** shipping the hardware Product and sending you a shipment confirmation email; or\n\n**(b)** making the software Product available to you; or\n\n**(c)** providing the Service to you.\n\nTherefore, that confirmation email is **not a binding acceptance** and is more of an acknowledgment that they’ve received your order and are processing it. Until shipping occurs (or software is delivered, etc.), Lenovo **reserves the right** to cancel or adjust your order **even if** you’ve already received a confirmation email or any other form of confirmation.\n\nI personally think that TV shows these days make the law seem very shallow to the average person, like; “Little guy sues company and wins!”. \n\nThe reality is, that every business has multiple built in protective and failsafe clauses layered into their contracts etc. to make sure that real consumers **will never win against them** in court. I feel like the average person should read more into the T&Cs so they know what they’re getting themselves into, but we don’t, so companies take advantage of that; and that is why we have lawyers :)",
  "Do enlighten me. 99% of companies in the EU are labeled “micro scale”. And also, way to deflect from the question about legislation ;)\n\n“A couple ten thousand dollars” in this case would be 5-10 laptops sold at the wrong price. You can see from this topic that ppl flock to these things like moths to a flame.\n\nMy most commonly used online computer store typically has a stock of about 50 of each gaming laptop, do the math on a say 5 of those products being mislabeled overnight and each those selling out at a €3999 discount. That’s about a million euro lost on a clear database error. “Just suck it up, it’s the law”, yeah not so much bro.",
  "Perfectly legal to have Ts and Cs that reserve the right to cancel orders where there has been made an obvious mistake",
  "Give an update if the order actually gets processed. Unlike what others said, the website itself is not a scam for sure.

  "Lenovo Ideapad slim 3 gen 10 AMD 14\" So i bought this laptop for £469 in the UK for university and i have had it for about a week now and I have not seen any reviews so i thought i would leave a review. It has a ryzen 5 8640hs with integrated radeon graphics, 16gb ram dual channel and a 60wh battery\n\nBuild quality: This laptop is made of sturdy plastic, the finish feels very nice but it is nothing to boast about, it is good enough for the price. I like how it is very lightweight and is really easy to carry around.\n\nDisplay: The anti-glare coating is great for this and really helps when it is sunny outside and the sun is very bright. 1920x1200 is very sharp but other than that its a regular 60hz IPS panel but it definitely gets the job done.\n\nKeyboard: This one does not come with a full size keyboard but I am not too bothered by this personally as I dont usually use the rest of the other keys. Sometimes I do press the wrong keys but once you get used to it, its a solid keyboard.\n\nPerformance: The CPU in this is very fast, whatever I do happens in an instant whether im video editing, watching videos, playing games or in a meeting. The 16gb ram also plays a huge role in this. What surprised me the most was the performance of the GPU considering its only 15W. I dont play very heavy games but this GPU was able to run forza horizon 4, fortnite, GTA, battlefield 1 and hollow Knight at good fps(these are the games I usually play). I also did some wii u emulation and it was flawless. One thing I will mention is that the laptop can be quite noisy when gaming on extreme performance mode but is very quiet when not being pushed.\n\nBattery: The battery on this is great for what it is. I was able to achieve around 7-8 hours from 100 percent to 20 whilst just doing my assignments(on battery saver). I got around 5-6 hours on netflix. When gaming the max i got was around 3 hours of battery life which is not too bad.",

He works in logistics so he has a few programs opened up at all times as well.\n\nThis is why it needs to be brisk as hell, so he can jump in-between everything without any hiccups./ \n\nWindows 11 will definitely not help with the task, but it's a must.\n\n\n\nGaming PCs are rather easy in comparison with laptops lol.

  "Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Gen 6: First impressions I purchased the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G6, model 21NQCTO1WWBR1 on July 2025 and would like to make my impressions about this product:\n\nDESIGN AND BUILD: We don't have much to comment on the design, as it's quite minimalist. We're surprised that not all the keyboard keys follow Lenovo's signature layout, as is typical on IdeaPads, but at least the Ctrl and Fn keys are in their traditional positions, unlike ThinkPads. The light color isn't bad, but it's a shame there wasn't a darker color option (not black, which is typically only seen on ThinkPads, but a darker gray would have been nice). The touchpad is a good size. We found the number of ports interesting, but the Ethernet port's position wasn't particularly helpful, being on the right side. It's interesting that it also has an SD card reader. The number of LEDs also caught our attention, with one next to each USB-C port, in addition to the power button itself (which we really like being separate from the keyboard). We liked the backlit keyboard and the dedicated \"?\", \"/\", \"°\", and \"Menu\" keys, although they sacrificed one of the Ctrl keys. At least it didn't come with the \"Copilot\" shortcut. We didn't really like the notch in the webcam area and found it a rather questionable design decision, but we understand its usefulness. We also liked that it came without those infamous labels on the palm rest, just the Intel seal.\n\nSCREEN: We liked the quality of the IPS, but we were disappointed that the screen had excessive IPS Glow at the bottom edge, quite visible with the screen on a black background even in bright light. My brother was okay with it, but I didn't like this defect at all, which I'm already accepting is quite common in current LCD screens, as I've also seen notebooks and even smartphones and tablets from other brands with this issue. It shouldn't happen, but we've come to understand that IPS Glow is now part of the experience of having an IPS LCD screen, which is unfortunate. At least we like the thin bezels.\n\nSOUND AND WEBCAM: Neither impressed in any aspect, but neither disappointed.\n\nBATTERY AND CHARGING: The USB-C charger is interesting. My brother tested it by playing YouTube videos in 1080p with maximum brightness, and it lasted over 5 hours unplugged. For a 60Wh battery, it's an okay battery, but it could be better.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND USABILITY: Regarding performance, considering its specifications, I consider it okay. It worked very well even for running virtual machines via VirtualBox. We didn't notice excessive heat on the keyboard when heavily loaded. My brother installed the Big Linux distro, and in testing, it has worked well, including mirroring the laptop screen to our Smart TV wirelessly. My brother was unable to get BlissOS, based on Android 13, to work, as it didn't recognize Wi-Fi, but emulating Android on Big Linux with WayDroid has worked well most of the time.\n\n**Have you also purchased a Lenovo ThinkBook?

  "I got the same laptop, with 8gb of RAM, and im quite satisfied with it. I use it mainly for college stuff, and it can handle an entire day of coding, browsing the internet and even playing some light games (such as Horizon Chase). \n\nBattery life on it is quite impressive on linux. I get 6-8h of usage with it. That's more than i get with Windows (i have no idea why i just get 3-5 hours on Windows), but i've seen some minor compatibility issues on linux, such as the mute key not lighting up or the volume keys getting \"sticky\" (if i hold it a little bit, it goes to max volume or 0), but overall, the laptop is very usable.\n\nI plan to upgrade to 16gb soon, because on my use case, 8gb is too low, especially when i get 16 tabs open for research + some niche software from 10 years and VScode.\n\nOBS: Você é o CAVBR do fórum Adrenaline, não é?",

  "BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH AFTER NVIDIA DRIVER UPDATE: Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 (i5-10th Gen, GTX 1650) has NO DISPLAY on internal or external ports. Seeking Community Help! Hello everyone,\n​I urgently need help. My laptop shows absolutely no display after updating the video driver. The keyboard lights up, but the screen stays completely black, and the HDMI output also shows nothing.\n​The Failure occurred on: 10/22/2025\n​My Laptop Specifications (Crucial Info):\n​Model: Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 (System Model: 81Y4 / 15IMH05).\n​Processor: Intel Core(TM) i5-10300H (10th Gen).\n​Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 (dedicated GPU) and Intel UHD Graphics (integrated GPU).\n​RAM: 16 GB DDR4.\n​The Problem:\n​The failure occurred immediately after running a driver update for the GTX 1650 using the official NVIDIA software (GeForce Experience). After the mandatory reboot, the display never came back on.\n​Diagnostic Steps I ALREADY TOOK (No Success):\n​Hard Reset: Disconnected the power adapter and battery (internal/external), drained residual power (held power button for 60 seconds), and powered on with the charger only.\n​External Display Test: Connected the laptop via HDMI to an external TV/Monitor. There is NO image on the external screen.\n​RAM Module Testing: Opened the chassis and tested each 8 GB RAM stick individually in both slots. Still a black screen.\n​Force Safe Mode: Forced Windows into Automatic Repair (power cycling 3 times). I have no display to select the boot options.\n​Novo Button: Tried accessing the BIOS/Recovery Menu using the dedicated Lenovo Novo Button. The keyboard lights, but the screen remains black.\n​I Need Guidance on USB BIOS Flash (Crisis Recovery):\n​I suspect the BIOS firmware managing GPU initialization is corrupted, and a USB flash is my last resort before professional service.\n​My Specific Questions:\n​Which BIOS file should I download (version name and extension) for my 81Y4/15IMH05 model?\n​What is the exact key combination for my model (e.g., \\text{Fn} + \\text{R} while plugging in power) to initiate the Crisis Recovery?\n​Is there a specific filename that the recovery system must recognize on the FAT32 formatted USB drive (e.g., BIOS.CAP or MAIN.FD)?\n​Is there any additional test related to the internal battery I should perform (e.g., disconnecting it for a longer period) to ensure a complete chipset reset?\n​What other alternative solutions do you think might work?\n​I greatly appreciate all your comments, thanks.",

  "Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15ACH6 – A review and upgrade path First, I’ll tell you about myself. Mainly because it could help you decide on getting the same or a similar laptop if you have similar needs to me. I’m a mechanical engineering student. Currently, I use CAD somewhat frequently for college and \\*very\\* frequently for personal use, so a dedicated GPU was pretty much necessary. A decently Good CPU was also needed for simulation work and \\*very\\* amateurish programming. Video and image editing are also hobbies of mine, but I don’t do anything extravagant so they weren’t really a deciding factor. I also love to be dramatic and firmly believe I am a professional writer. I’m not, so if you don’t like that kind of writing, I’ll leave a TL;DR at the end of this post.\n\nSo, the laptop. The IdeaPad 3 Gaming I bought comes with a wired RGB mouse I will probably not use (it’s still in its sealed bag), some very disappointing manuals and guides (I just downloaded the actual ones from Lenovo’s site) and a 135W AC charger. Internally, it has a Ryzen 5 5600H, a single 8 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM RAM clocked at 3200 MHz, one 512 GB M.2 Samsung NVMe Gen3x4 SSD (model is MZ-ALQ512B), a Nvidia RTX 3050 4GB and finally a 15.6” 1080p 120 Hz display.\n\nI actually wanted to do this just because of this next section: Upgrades. I’ve always been a sucker for high-capacity drives, so the tiny 512 GB of space made me feel uneasy every single time I thought about my locally stored movies, TV shows, comics, games… Point is: I wanted to upgrade. Problem was: I read online that only the 2242 M.2 slot (the one with the stock SSD) could reach Gen4 speeds.\n\nI’ve also read only that this thing would NOT work with a higher than 512 GB drive on the 2242 slot. I just ignored that and got a 2 TB Crucial P310 Gen4 drive. FUCK. YEAH.\n\nI found it on Micro Center for sale at $149.99 USD too. This is important because my third-world mind was already going crazy inside that celestial store. I felt like I was dreaming in that GPU aisle. The custom keyboards too???? I loved every single plack-time I spent in there. My dad (we were on a business trip btw) was searching for a USB to VGA cable and they had it. WHAT. Who even needs that? Truly, an ascending and heavenly experience.\n\nAnyways. I was very worried it wouldn’t work. I already have a fully functional 2 TB NVMe and a 1 TB SATA drive on my PC, so if this didn’t work I just wasted half my salary in something I would 100% not be able to sell at that same price. Not to mention, I still needed an adapter. This thing is 2230, and if you remember correctly, the slot only fits 2242 drives. So…\n\nI’ll go over how good it performs now:\n\n* Gaming\n\nIn the very few games I tested, it was a very good experience. I mostly play only old games, so this might not mean much to you, but Bayonetta, Sonic X Shadow Generations and Rocket League ran perfectly fine. In Bayonetta’s case, it ran even better than on my desktop -$1200- gaming PC, which honestly doesn’t mean much since it barely counts as running in that system.\n\n* CAD\n\nThe most important thing to me. It runs flawlessly. And now, we go back to the Crucial drive! I designed the adapters using Inventor 2025 on the base laptop (as in “stock configuration”). The only problem I could name is that, for some reason, it takes Inventor like a whole minute to load the first project. Be it a fully finished model or just a blank file. It’s very weird.\n\nAfter finishing the model and getting it printed, I was ready to see if my dumb ass would be enjoying two whole terabytes of data on his new laptop.\n\n \n\nIt. Worked.\n\n \n\nI was so stupidly happy. And you know what? I haven’t mentioned that I also installed two 16 GB 3200 MHz sticks. EVERYTHING WORKED WITH NO ISSUES. It felt amazing. The trip to Micro Center, the fact that I was actually upgrading a laptop, the excitement I felt going into the Amazon Locker to retrieve my shiny new 32 gigs of RAM… Truly a wonderful experience.\n\nAfter I installed Windows I decided to check both drive’s speeds, just to be sure. Another big discovery for us; 15ACH6 owners. Turns out that if you only have ONE M.2 drive installed, the drive will run at full Gen3x4 speeds. The damn manual says it runs at Gen3x2, but that is almost a complete lie. Thing is, if you install TWO NVMe drives, the speeds get halved, effectively functioning as two Gen3x2 slots. I’ll add the CrystalDiskMark results as pictures if you want to check them.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI’m really enjoying this laptop. It’s a very capable device. I can confirm that it supports up to 32 GB and a 2 TB NVMe drive and would recommend having just one of those installed to maximize speeds.",

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Most Honest Review of the Lenovo Yoga 7i – Only 3 days in*  \n\nKeep in mind I’m only three days into my new purchase of the Lenovo Yoga 7i 14, but so far I’m really impressed. After returning my M2 Macbook Air Last October, I had been in the market for a new laptop for quite some time, and the Yoga was always something I was considering. The no touchscreen on the Macbook Air simply wasn’t cutting it for me, which is why I ended up returning it despite my relative investment in the Apple ecosystem (ipad pro m1, iphone 12 pro, airpods pro)\n\nMy model: i7 1255U, 16GB DDR5 Memory, 512GB SSD\n\n**Performance:** So far, the performance has been great. Not sure if it’s the marketing gimmick, but the evo certified i7 CPU is quick and extremely responsive in ways that my desktop isn’t. For quick tasks such as opening your apps from the taskbar or simply interacting with the Windows UI, it’s a very snappy chip that has yet to disappoint whatsoever. The 16GB of DDR5 memory is also impressive here, and I’m able to keep dozens of tabs open on Microsoft Edge without any hassle. Definitely think the upgrade was worth it in this sense, 8GB just never seems to cut it these days.\n\n**Display**: One of the best features of this laptop, and is Dolby Vision certified. It has a really nice looking and glossy 2K resolution that looks great from writing documents to watching Netflix–you can definitely notice the upgraded resolution in this sense. I’ve heard some complaints about the display being too glossy, but I prefer it over a matte finish because it feels nicer to navigate on when in touch mode (although it *can* become a fingerprint magnet at times). \n\n**Keyboard:** Keeping this section short and simple. The BEST laptop keyboard I’ve ever typed on. When I first tried it, I was shocked at the switches’ tactility and it was honestly a bit harsh but I’m getting more used to it. \n\n**Trackpad:** Not the best. One of the few downsides of this laptop. The material feels nice, but its touch sensitivity could be improved. \n\n**Battery Life:** Also, not the worst but could be better. I’ve been using battery savings mode on Windows 11 which has seemed to mitigate some of the battery life issues I was initially having. I believe Lenovo advertises over 10 hours and I’m just not sure that’s accurate for my workflow.\n\nOVERALL: Great laptop, 2 in 1 functionality is awesome and feels really polished with Windows 11. Stone Blue color is also awesome and would recommend it!! 4.5/5 overall.",
  "Just got a Yoga 9i myself, also came from a MacBook. \n\nHaven't even had it for more than 24 hours yet, but so far, really can echo a lot of the points you made. Amazing screen, build quality, and speakers. The stylus support is an added bonus as I markup PDFs quite frequently for work.\n\nIf I had to pick a complaint, would be around battery and efficiency.

  "Danke für deine Erfahrungen. Ich wünschte ich könnte auch die Erfahrungen über mein Geräte teilen aber dieses kam nie an und seitdem ärgere ich mich über den Kundendienst rum.\n\n**Meine Erfahrungen zum Lenovo-Service:**  \nIch habe vor über 8 Wochen bei Lenovo eine Bestellung aufgegeben, bestehend aus einer Laptop-Tasche und einem Tablet. Das Paket wurde zwar geliefert, jedoch war nur die Laptop-Tasche enthalten – das Tablet, das auf dem Lieferschein ebenfalls ausgewiesen war, fehlte.\n\nSeitdem habe ich mehrfach den Kundensupport kontaktiert, um das Problem zu klären, und wurde jedes Mal mit standardisierten Antworten abgespeist, die offensichtlich nicht auf meinen spezifischen Fall eingehen. Es wurde mir wiederholt geraten, bei Nachbarn nachzufragen, obwohl ich von Anfang an erklärt habe, dass das Paket bei mir angekommen ist, aber unvollständig war.\n\nNach wochenlangem Hin und Her bekam ich schließlich die Anweisung, einen Polizeibericht zu erstellen, damit eine Rückerstattung oder Ersatzlieferung erfolgen kann. Diese Forderung ist vollkommen unangemessen, da es sich hier nicht um einen Diebstahl oder Verlust handelt, sondern um ein Versäumnis seitens Lenovo.\n\nLaut geltendem Recht trägt der Verkäufer bei Verbrauchsgüterkäufen das Risiko für die Lieferung – es liegt also in der Verantwortung von Lenovo, die vollständige Lieferung der Ware sicherzustellen.\n\n**Fehlender Kundenservice:**\n\nDer Kundensupport scheint automatisierte Antworten zu geben, ohne auf den individuellen Fall einzugehen. Trotz klarer Schilderung des Problems wurde ich immer wieder mit unsinnigen Vorschlägen abgespeist.\n\n**Unangemessene Forderungen:**\n\nDie Forderung, dass ich als Kunde einen Polizeibericht erstellen soll, ist nicht nur rechtlich fragwürdig, sondern auch eine Zumutung. Es ist nicht meine Aufgabe, die Fehler von Lenovo zu korrigieren.\n\n**Verzögerungen:**\n\nSeit fast acht Wochen warte ich auf eine Lösung. Statt den Fehler umgehend zu beheben, werde ich mit bürokratischen Anforderungen hingehalten.\n\n**Mangelhafte Kommunikation:**\n\nEs gibt keinerlei proaktive Updates oder klare Lösungswege. Stattdessen muss ich als Kunde ständig nachhaken, nur um erneut enttäuscht zu werden.\n\n**Vertrauensverlust:**\n\nNach dieser Erfahrung bin ich nicht nur enttäuscht, sondern habe das Vertrauen in Lenovo als Unternehmen verloren. Ein solches Verhalten ist weder kundenorientiert noch akzeptabel für ein Unternehmen dieser Größe.\n\n**Fazit:**\n\nIch habe das Gerät vor 8 Wochen bezahlt und warte seitdem auf die Lieferung des Tablets oder eine Rückerstattung meines Geldes. Der Kundenservice gibt sein Bestes, mich immer wieder abzuwimmeln.\n\nDieser Umgang mit Kunden ist schlicht inakzeptabel.\n\nIch kann Lenovo nach dieser Erfahrung niemandem empfehlen und werde selbst in Zukunft keine Produkte mehr bei diesem Unternehmen kaufen.",

I sent the laptop to them all they did is factory reset my machine and then sent it back with exterior damage to the chasis. I have a very big dent on the front left of the laptop. I spent hours on support for them to finally say they were going to fix the damage for free and I had before and after pics, then they fucking blue balled me right at the end and said they were not doing it for free and going to charge me like 530 bucks to fix the chasis and hinge, which were both damaged in tranist or during the initial repair.

I just came back from the library after a 8 hour session (10 AM - 5:45 PM) and still had 25% battery by the end. I was running the screen around 75% of the screen brightness and had 2 desktops with 2 separate edge windows, 6-7 edge tabs open, MS word and OneNote. I run both the intelligent cooling mode on Vantage and balanced performance mode on windows but I do limit the maximum CPU in windows power plan to 50%. For my use case of note taking, browsing, writing papers it does not slow down or lags. Sorry for long review lol but I was trying to find an objective review before I bought it and I couldn’t find any, hope this helps tho. \n\nI love my 16” 2023, the pencil is a plus for me to take notes and screen is a beauty to use. I’m upgrading from a base 2020 M1 MBP, I sold it already and I also sold my 2020 iPad Pro since I can just carry around my Yoga 7i instead of both laptop and iPad.

  "Yes it's the 2 in 1 convertible. Hinge has been fine and absolutely no issues, it is sturdy and doesn't wobble a lot. \n\nNothing new to report, just that battery has been consistent to about 7-8 hours each day and that is more than enough for me to go to class, take notes and then review at the library until 6 PM. It's a little heavier than my old 13\" M1 MBP and the battery does not last nearly as long that (I would need to charge it every other day - newer MacBook laptops are crazy for battery life), but the bigger screen, the USB-A ports, nicer keyboard and pen support is what makes it 100% worth it for me. And also for a fraction of the price for the Apple equivalent.",

And while neither will ever be mistaken for a high efficiency CPU, the 7735HS will deliver slightly better battery life when all else is equal.",

  "So, just to make extra sure I'm understanding correctly since I have the same question, it's the gen 7 that comes out on top?",
  "It'd be worth looking at the E series ThinkPad.  Probably a little more expensive, but the Gen6 AMD or Gen7 Intel that should be available if you're not in the US offers a massively nicer display (optional) to the ThinkBook.  If in the US, then probably nothing you're going to find will be significantly better in this price range since the 2.2K display isn't offered here for the G6 AMD, and the G7 Intel is taking FOREVER to be released here.",

  "I said it previously around here, you can't trust a brand, enshittification is a thing and laptops have always been a bit more fragile than something like a phone because they have more parts, they have moving parts and they're expected to be fairly thin. And as someone who has repaired some laptops, has helped several people with choosing laptops and PC parts in the past, I repeat, you can't trust one brand, what you have to do for laptops  is, after reducing your choices to 2-4 models you need to look at what people are saying about the model, make sure there's not a lot complaints about something related to the hardware because then you'll be regretting your purchase. So again, don't just go with what people say about a brand being good or bad, that's usually bad or dated advice, you have to check the models that you're interested in to avoid future issues.",

Lenovo has great tech support, but they tend to be more expensive.

Even then the older MacBook had issues. All of which are expensive laptops targeted for premium uses. Apart from that I’ve had like 10 different stuff failing in the past 5 years, including phone, iPad, GPU, monitor, PSU etc, so I’d never consider something failing as “manufacturer is bad”, but then how can I tell it’s good or bad if everything from every brand does this?",

Like my father-in-law often says, \"buy cheap, buy twice.\"\n\nOne thing you *might* find helpful -- go look for teardown videos on youtube for whatever you're thinking about.

Something that's borderline obsolete even before you've finished unboxing it is not going to be a good use of your cash, even if it's looking like a good price in the moment.

Size constraints mean keeping them at sensible temperatures is harder than desktops, and none of them are sensibly used on your lap for longer than a couple of minutes.

BUT even said that their are issues ( like even buying new you need to do a re paste the CPU/GPU from the factory ) WHICH IS FUCKING ABSURD FOR A NEW UNIT, LET ALONE A CORPATE/BUSINESS CLASS LAPTOP !!!!\n\nFact of the matter is 90% of the PC laptop space has been skirting by with shit build quality for years. You have to pay out of the nose for anything close to good build quality and decent thermals that if you dont need or want the highest specs i either buy a used 1-2 year old laptop with good reviews or wait till what i want spec to get replaced by a newer generation and buy on clearance ( since i know they have fixed any major bugs on that platform ) .   \n  \nmy point is ALL laptop makers put out shits in the under 2000$ space now a days. most gaming laptops under a 1000$ wont even last 5 years. I work in dusty / high vibration environments so much so that i would have spinning HD fail on me before HD went SSD / M2 drives. So my point of view might be skewed to the extremes, but at your price point i would of gotten a used 2-3 year old thinkpad / business class laptop with better specs that is well reviewed then buying a new consumer grade laptop. And before you wanna paint me as a Lenovo fan boy i would never buy one of their consumer grade laptops new or used. \n\nEspecially if your not gaming i would never buy a new consumer grade laptop, when business class laptops can be had in the sub 500$ that build quality wise would run circles around the cheap crap companies are selling to regular users. if you insist on buying new ( and for not gaming ) you should also be buying ryzen tho, intel give you crap battery life. \n\nin the end you get what you pay for, if you expect a sub 400$ new laptop to feel nice and have good build qualty the buddy you need to adjust your expectations. decent laptops cost decent money, if you want qualty for that kind of money your way better off buying used and 2-3 generations older.",

  "Honestly, I'd say just look at what specifications meet your needs and then just go and look in the store if it's a shoddy design. Typically, when you're looking for exterior risks, you should look for mixed materials,  IE the hinges are different than the body and don't have a good tolerance for motion. If it's wobbly on the hinge when you buy it, it likely will break apart when the hinge wears out. \n\nPersonally, I have a lenovo yoga 9i with a pretty beefy hinge, which has served me solidly for four years now. But you don't need a beefy hinge like that. All the yogas have good hinges. I haven't really seen many non-transforming Windows laptops in a while, so I can't comment on hinges that don't have 360 capabilities.  The mid-range Dell inspirions(up to $900) will survive, though Im not sure how long. Asus and acer both have good models. If the base price is a bargain for the components, it's likely a bad model. The only feasible bargain is an open box or end of year discounting. \n\nCPU wise, don't pick some 6 core beast. For office work, you'd be best off picking a 4 core laptop with decently high clock speed and good turbo max speeds. Most of the time you're only using one or two cores. A GPU is likely to be a huge upcharge and also might hinder the CPU speeds for lower cost models since they will move more of the budget towards the GPU.",

  "No laptop is going to be perfect - the laptop you have, or the laptop you can afford, is going to be the best fit for you.  Consumer opinions tend to be driven by circumstance.  Based on your knowledge of the true meaning of HP, I'm guessing you happen to watch a certain laptop repair tech on Youtube - I tend to align pretty well with his opinions on laptops.  My only issue with the HP spec that you have listed is the i3 CPU - low class Intel silicon is not a very good fit for the workloads you've described.  Considering that my daily use ultrabook is a 7th gen core i7 ThinkPad, and my workstation is an aging quad core 4th gen i7 mobile workhorse (Also from the thinkpad lineup) my opinion may not hold much weight - but even a newish i3 seems woefully underspecced for your workload.  I'd also prioritize business laptops - ThinkPad, HP Elitebook, or Dell's Precision or Latitude lineup.  Consumer grade laptops are built to be replaceable toys - business laptops are built to survive.  They aren't flashy, they are built for a job, that they have to do, and they're workhorses - yeah, you'll often miss out on flashy features, or showstopping performance numbers, but you'll still be able to use them 10+ years down the line.  Also, because they're usually bought in high numbers by businesses, they can be found on the secondhand market with usually light use.  That being said, for your gen-AI tasks, i'd probably steer you towards a desktop, if you are looking to do anything that isn't cloud based - the recommended system hardware requirments for \"Local AI\" get moved with every generation.  If you just want to be able to ChatGPT stuff, then any laptop will do, but for running local models, if you want them to be of any long term use, you'll need to keep your local hardware up to date - and depending on your usage, you'll need a lot more storage flexibility than the average 2025 ultrabook offers - a desktop is only one newegg visit, and a couple of screwdriver spins away from more storage/ram, as your needs grow.",

  "People also are very prone to small sample size anecdotal evidence having way too much sway on them, especially when it's personally affected them or someone close to them.  You especially see it with cars, \"I had a (insert brand) and it was a piece of shit always having problems!\" Waste thousands of dollars or get afraid of wasting thousands and that *one* experience that you or your friend or your neighbor had might carry way too much weight in your mind. \n\nI also am always a little skeptical of the more widespread reviews and reputations, you never know what kind of money is being tossed around to sway the right people or just what other type of influence there's been on public perception. I used to be a mechanic and the things I'd consistently see working on and inspecting cars all day every day sometimes aligned with the public perception and sometimes were way off.\n\nWe all fall victim to it though, our brains love to jump to those conclusions. You bordered on it here, you're going off of one single ASUS laptop where maybe it *was* a good example of the norm or maybe you just got really lucky. I always have to stop myself from thinking that way with Dell, I had one Dell laptop in high school like 20 years ago that was total garbage after my mom really splurged on it for Christmas and I was super excited about it.

I really like this laptop but going to return due to only below reason.\n\nRam is 16GB, All RAM is soldered on board. No Ram upgradable option for future. Also if RAM get some issues ,not changeable as well.",
  "I'll assume US.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/HP-Business-Touchscreen-i7-1165G7-Fingerprint/dp/B0DC95XL4C/ref=sr\\_1\\_7](https://www.amazon.com/HP-Business-Touchscreen-i7-1165G7-Fingerprint/dp/B0DC95XL4C/ref=sr_1_7)\n\nStill highly underwhelming screen, but 2 SODIMM so can do 32/64 GB upgrades in the future if you wanted.  Don't think this one has a backlit keyboard either, but may be more worth it for the RAM upgradability.\n\nThe 5825U is a great CPU for what you say you want to do, however.  So either one would be fine on that.",
  "Thanks for your reply. Very much appreciated.\n\nYes I am US. You said right about Lenovo thinkbook screen is highly underwhelming.\n\nI like the one amazon-hp link which you sent, I like it but after recheck i see its refurbished. I would like to buy new one. I can increase my budget if any good machine is available.\n\nI found another one ASUS vivo book. Fyi, both below are brand new laptops.\n\nASUS Vivobook 16\" WUXGA Notebook Intel Core i7-1355U 16GB RAM 1TB SSD Intel Iris Xe Graphics Indie Black : $550\n\nLenovo ThinkBook 15 Gen 4 Notebook 15.6\" FHD AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 16GB RAM 512GB SSD Mineral Grey : $530\n\n\n\nAsus vivo book now inclining me more, looks like it has 1 TB SSD, 16 inch screen, better screen size & display, Intel i7 13th gen processor, back lit kb. Battery time might be not good.\n\n  \nAnyone used Lenovo Thinkbook or Asus vivo or any other option which i can consider ?",
  "Lenovo thinkbook 16 i3 13th gen v/s Asus Vivobook 15 i3 12th gen? Which one is better under 40k rupees?\nMy basic usage will be making presentations, multimedia consumption, it has to be snappy and fast, with a fine display and with a good robust built.",
  "Has anyone bought the Lenovo Thinkbook Plus Gen 3 Dual Display 17.3\" I am in the market for a new computer. I REALLY want that wide screen. I use programs regularly that feel limited by the width I am used to with my 17.3\" 16:9 screen.\n\nHowever...it maxes out at 32gb of memory. PLUS I want to create a dual drive so I can pop in my old computers'\n\nWDC  WDS200T2B0B-00YS70 (1.8TB) memory with all my docs, and keep a 1TB memory for the OS and other use.\n\nAnd I would have to start working with Windows 11 (which I am not prepared to do right now). \n\nI JUST got a Dell Precision 7740 with 64GB and 1TB with a AMD Radeon (TM) Pro WX 3200 Graphics, and Central Processing Unit (CPU): Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9850H CPU @ 2.60GHz for $1150\n\nI don't really like this computer's keyboard, and sound. Im not sure if I want to keep it, or get another one, a used z-book like the one I used to have but a newer version with a better screen.\n\n",
  "Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 (12'', Gen 8) VS. Lenovo V15 Gen 4  I'm choosing between these 2 laptops because I have a tight budget and I'm restricted to the Lenovo brand only. Can you guys help me?",
  "Which one did you buy?",
  "is this a good laptop for a long run as a college student? (lenovo thinkbook 14 gen 7 amd) [Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Generation 7 AMD](https://preview.redd.it/y2c7ilafgvld1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff5702bd12b7900b40c57648e99aed99c13053b)\n\nI'm planning to purchase a new laptop and found this laptop that interest me. The laptop specs that I have customized and choose are as follows:\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen™ 7 7735HS (8 Cores 16 Threads)\n* GPU: AMD Radeon™ 680M\n* RAM: 8GB upgradeable until 64GB @ DDR5-4800\n* Storage: 512GB\n* Ports:\n   * SD card reader\n   * USB-A (USB 5Gbps)\n   * Ethernet (RJ-45)\n   * Kensington® Nano Security Slot™\n   * USB-C® (USB 10Gbps), with USB PD 3.0 & DP 1.4\n   * USB-A (USB 5Gbps), Always On\n   * HDMI®\n   * USB-C® (USB4® 40Gbps), with USB PD 3.0 & DP 1.4\n   * Headphone / microphone combo jack (3.5mm)\n\nI'm planning to use this laptop for my computer science studies and continue using it afterward at my workplace as a software/network engineer. The variety of I/O ports make it suitable for long-term use, imo. And from what I heard AMD tends to use less power and less heat which makes the battery life longer compared to Intel cause I need a better battery life for long classes while maintaining a decent amount of power. I also plan to play some light games on it, definitely not AAA titles. Some of the games I have in mind are Cuphead, Cult of the Lamb, Astroneer, No Man's Sky, and Fortnite.\n\nFor some reason, I haven't found many reviews on YouTube about this laptop, which is kind of odd. So, for those who already own it or have experience with it, in your opinion, is this a good laptop for college and work?",
  "Lenovo ThinkPad L14 gen 3 I just bought this computer so I'm not asking if I should buy it, but I would like you guys opinion on it.",
  "Was this a black Friday special? Also how are you enjoying your laptop?",
  "oh I just got the same one AMD Ryzen 5, no touch. I got it couple weeks ago and I’m really liking it. The only thing i just realized it’s the webcam seems super low quality and the trackpad sometimes miss behaves, but other than that amazing purchase for the buck.",
  "It's currently my favorite laptop I own.  So...that probably says enough for my opinion to be obvious.",
  "Also bought this. Nowhere near as good a deal as they’re advertising it to be but it’s a really good one nonetheless. Will likely upgrade the RAM at some point but it’s probably already more computer than I actually need. I hope we like it!",
  "I bought this , it's great , better than T14 in term of upgrading (no solder wifi and ram, so when wifi or ram die you can replace)",
  "It's a good laptop, fast ssd, good service, and overheating isn't that deep now.",
  "And yes it was",
  "The trackpad misbehaving for me happens if I happen to press a key at the same time as I use the track pad. By misbehaving I think you mean just not moving the cursor.",
  "Yes. I saw a 2300 dollar discount on the computer and it came with some pretty good specs, that are easily upgradable. And I know ThinkPad are reliable and sturdy so i just had to acquire.",
  "Are you also having slight overheating issues? What are your temps",
  "Oh no, i’m not pressing any key and suddenly it just gets stuck or select things when I’m not pressing it and moves windows or select the content while moving it, a bit annoying",
  "No , 50 C average",
  "Mine touchpad misbehaves also , but it just gets slower and latency",
  "Lenovo Thinkbook G5 (R3 7330U) or Ideapad Slim 3 (R5 5500U) ?? Buying a laptop for my father, entry level, fast and good battery, mainly used for minor office tasks and media streaming.

But in a dilemma after reading reviews on quality of ideapad. laptop is going to be safely used for normal tasks, low to none gaming, so okay with 5000 series processor.                                                                                                              others on list were *Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Intel Core i3 1215U* and *ASUS Vivobook 15 (2024) Intel Core i3 1215U*\n\nEmphasis on build quality, cpu and display.\n\n**Will need quick decision as need to buy asap.**"
