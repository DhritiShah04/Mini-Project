  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Upgrade, or try to fix and/or live with it? [Legion Pro 5 16ARX8] Hey there! I bought a Legion Pro 5 16ARX8 (82WM0006US) just over two years ago. It's been great, but recently it's starting to accumulate some wear/issues and I'm wondering if 1) it's new enough that I should get it fixed and live with whatever can't be repaired, or 2) upgrade to something new?\n\nCurrent issues: \n\n- The screen got damaged when I had the laptop in a checked bag while traveling, wherein there's a faint thin line midway up the screen, which is functional for some colors but shows as a faint blue line for others. I've gotten estimates for repairs, which are always in the $400-500 range. But currently it's fine enough that I can live with it, it'd just be a nice plus to have it fixed.\n- It's been overheating badly lately, and some components haven't been working well. I cleaned out the fans to some improvement, but since the overheating issues, my keyboard sometimes stops working intermittently (usually fixed with a restart).\n- The trackpad mouse has been acting up, but it's probably because I badly reconnected the ZIF connector when cleaning out the internals, and could probably fix this.\n\n\nCurrent specs:\n\n- AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX\n- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070\n- 32GB DDR5\n- 1TB SSD\n- 2 TB SSD\n\nI've been thinking of upgrading to a newer Legion 5 Pro (maybe the new [Gen 10](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-pro-series/legion-pro-5-gen-10-16-inch-amd/83ltcto1wwus1)?) or an Asus ROG Zephyrus, either the [G16](https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/asus/rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gu605) or maybe something more compact for traveling like the [G14](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-3k-oled-120hz-gaming-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-1tb-platinum-white/6613954.p?skuId=6613954&sb_share_source=PDP). Open to other ideas! But the hitch is whether it's worth the $2-3k after just 2 years with the current one...\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading, grateful for any input!",
  "Legion 5 Pro US pushed into May/June ",
  "I said this is likely elsewhere. They will move after the big boys release their Ryzen 5 series gamers and then price it appropriately. It is disappointing for sure, but I am not holding my breadth anymore.",
  "When I chatted with them a few weeks back they told me should be out by the end of April, now it's may-june, then it will be july-August and so on and so forth, we might not even see it release this year🤪 it's all because of amd and their chip shortage!!",

  "Just chose Alienware M15 R4 configured with similar specs. It has no QHD, slightly higher pricing.  But Alienware comes with better build, good thermals (Vapor Chamber), higher TDP, thunderbolt, and Advanced Optimus etc. QHD is not a deal breaker for me.",

  "Higher tdp? How? Lenovo has 165 watts for the 3080 as well.",
  "It's an obnoxious bot. I wish mods would ban them",

Advanced Optimus brought it down even further and the fan was tolerable.\n\nZen 3 is still a step up architecture wise,  but a laptop is more than just a CPU or paper specs. There is no concrete date 5pro release in the US and increasing buzz is that it could be May or June or later for actual \"beginning\" availability in the US. Can't wait for ever.\n\nLooking forward to seeing the release in a major market like the US and controlled comparison reviews come in.\n\nThis not a brand issue, just what one is able to actually see, handle, and buy in the US.",

Maybe its down to that?   \nAnd the verdict part, maybe they didnt realize that performance differences between other 5800H laptops was probably due to the inferior RAM and hence they gave the verdict based on the fact that its slower in many ways to other 5800H laptops",

  "Will the ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2025) Handle My Workload ArcGIS Pro + AutoCAD & Tons of Multitasking? I am looking for a laptop to use as a workstation in case I need to provide my own equipment in the future. I am a Design Engineer working with Aerial & Underground fiber optics in the Telecom field. I mainly use ArcGIS Pro & AutoCAD for drafting & designing routes. While I have one of those programs open, I also must have MS Teams, MS Outlook, MS Excel, Adobe Acrobat, Google Earth Pro, 2 to 3 File Explorer folders, plus a web browser running Katapult + Katapult Photo + Katapult Map + Client Engineering Support Platform + Sharepoint + Smartsheet (around 6-7 tabs depending on Google Earth Pro/Google Maps) all running at the same time. I can get away with Google Maps most of the time. Long story short heavy multi tasking processing is a must.\n\nI do not know much about the difference between AMD & Intel processors but from what I have heard AMD excels at multi tasking & Intel is better at running single tasks. Please correct me if any technical information is wrong. Things have evolved a lot since I last purchased a laptop a decade ago for college.\n\nMy current position supplied me a laptop I am very happy with. Here are the specs:\n\nDell Precision 5690\n\nIntel Core Ultra 7 155H (3.80 GHz)\n\n32 GB RAM Speed 7467 MT/s\n\n1 TB SSD\n\n128 MB Intel Arc Graphics\n\n16 inch touchscreen\n\nI have had bad experiences with the Dell I used throughout high school. After having it serviced 7 or 8 times because of the cheap plastic hinge, I replaced it with an all metal Asus in 2017 when I started college. Here are those specs:\n\nASUS Q504UA\n\nIntel Core i5 7200U (2.5 GHz)\n\n12 GB RAM Speed 2133 MHz\n\n1 TB SSD\n\n128 MB Intel HD Graphics 620\n\n15.6 inch touchscreen 2 in 1\n\nEven though I had bad experiences with Dell in the past, this Precision 5690 is really nice. I like the all metal design for the shell & hinges. My only problems with it is that I have yet to see them go on sale and I hate that it only has USB C ports. The XPS goes on sale from time to time but I do not know if that will give me what I need.\n\nAfter doing research the unanimous answer from coworkers, gamer friends, the internet, & even AI was that the bare minimum I need is 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, an AMD Ryzen 7 or 9 / Intel Core Ultra 7 or 9 / Intel Core i7 or i9 processor, & a dedicated graphics card. Preferably I want something that has an extra RAM slot & an extra M.2 slot so that I can upgrade RAM & storage in the future.\n\nI pulled an all nighter last night going through all of the Best Buy Black Friday deals trying to find THE ONE. I narrowed it down to Lenovo, & Asus. I ended up with three options: Lenovo Yoga 9i Pro, Lenovo Legion Pro 5, & the ASUS ROG Strix G16. All three had 16 inch screens but the Yoga got kicked out because it does not have expandable RAM or storage. That left the Legion Pro & Strix G16. I watched a ton of review & comparison videos, checked rtings, & I think I finally did it. I chose the ASUS ROG Strix G16 based on my personal preferences, AMD over Intel processor, & the nail in the coffin was my childhood friend’s recommendation plus his father’s recommendation. They preferred Asus over Lenovo. His fathet owned a Legion Pro, the best Alienware 16 inch, & recently switched to the Strix G16 & loves it. The only difference between my choice & his is that mine has the RTX 5070 while his has the RTX 570Ti, which in my opinion is not worth the extra 800 dollars which is the current difference with the black friday sale favoring mine.\n\nHere are the specs for the winner:\n\nASUS ROG Strix G16\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9000 9955HX3D (2.5 GHz with boost up to 5.4 GHz)\n\n32 GB DDR5 RAM (5600 MHz)\n\nExtra SO DIMM slot (tool free)\n\n1 TB SSD PCIe 4.0\n\nExtra M.2 slot (PCIe Gen 5 ready)\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 with 8 GB GDDR7\n\n16 inch 2.5K 240 Hz 3 ms Nebula Display\n\nNow here are my questions for you all:\n\n1) Will this do what I need it to do?\n\n2) Do these laptops last or will it brick in a few years?\n\nI plan on babying this laptop if that helps.\n\n3) Is 20% off the best sale I am going to find for a current generation ROG Strix G16?\n\n4) Do I need an external cooling pad or fan? If not needed, would you still recommend one, & if so which one works best with this laptop?\n\nThis is going to be my personal computer that can double as a workstation if I need it. The fact that it is a gaming laptop is a plus for when I finally make the switch from console. I like the fact there are 2 x USB-A 3.2 in addition to the the 2 x UBS-C ports. I do not know if I will ever be a full PC person since I like being able to move around, laptops are my power meets portability. My job tried to give me a computer but I declined as I visit family and a tower is not a realistic option for me to travel with.\n\nI am sure this is probably way too much information & I might be making too big of a deal out of this. This thing will probably do everything I need & more. I just like doing my homework before sinking a grand or more into something. Buying a new car took years & the only reason I finally did it was because squirrels totaled my old one.\n\nThanks for your help guys and gals I really appreciate it!",
  "Honestly, think about if you actually NEED a laptop. With this budget you can build a WAY faster desktop.\n\nPersonally, I'd build an equivalent desktop which would save some cash, sell my current laptop and use that money to buy like a 4050 laptop.\n\nYou'd have a capable workstation at home, and a machine to get you by during the day.\n\nThat's of course if you don't NEED portability at all times. \n\nIf you do, this should be fine. I know a engineer who uses a RTX 2060 laptop for work to this day. And my dad's company (which is for construction), had some similarly powerful workstations a few years ago.\n\n\n\nTldr; This is fine, but if possible get a desktop + a reasonable laptop, for your use-case.",
  "I would say get intel, it had a lot more cores then amd, but in all fairness the laptop should be enough for all of your tasks, 32gb might not be enough so consider upgrading, but i think you should get the laptop",
  "I appreciate your feedback. I actually did think about it. Right now I'm doing well in my position, just was getting worried about the future. I have that ASUS that still works, & a back up Lenovo that was a hand me down to replace the eye sore that was my old Dell. The 2 in 1 ASUS got me through college using AutoCAD, Inventor, ArcGIS, & Solidworks. I don't think I need a new laptop (or desktop), I may have just been giddy at the prospect of getting a deal. I am a sucker for deals & have been known to be impulsive not to miss out on them. The deal is good for 1 more day so I'm going to sleep on it again tonight, but more than likely I may not move forward on it right now. As long as things are going well with work I don't need a personal work station. If I do need it in the future I will have done all this research & it will be an easier ordeal not having to start from scratch. \n\nThank you for your candor!\n\nEdit: I slept on it. I did some more research based on the other person's comment I looked for more comparison videos between the Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 U9 275HX & AMD Ryzen 9 9000 Series 9955HX3D on the ROG Strix G16 (2025). Based on that research I've decided to move forward on my purchase but have switched from the AMD to the Intel processor since the Intel model is newer, has an improved chasis,  & has a lot of newly improved features that support more future proofing and quality of life than the older AMD model. \n\nI am not a desktop kind of guy, portability is more important to me than strictly power & perfomance. I understand PC will outperform & be lower cost when compared to laptops. Also having both isn't a realistic option for me, it would be one or the other. My personal preference or bias is laptop > desktop.",
  "I did more research after posting & it looks like you were right. JarrodsTech compared the Intel & AMD versions. The Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 U9 275HX model came out ahead of the AMD Ryzen 9 9000 Series 9955HX3D in most cases. It also has easier access to the internals with a pull tab instead of 12 plus screws just to remove the bottom panel. The Intel model supports the next generation PCIe 5 for future proofing on both SSD ports whereas the AMD only supports PCIe 5 on 1 of 2. The Intel version includes 3 USB A ports where as the AMD only has 2 USB A ports. They have the same number of USB C ports but the port speeds are faster on the Intel than on the AMD model. The Intel also has WiFi 7 compared to WiFi 6 on the AMD.\n\nThe Intel model looks better with the 360° RGB, & it runs cooler thanks to the updated vapor chamber design. It also uses liquid metal & cools both the CPU & GPU, while the AMD version only cooled the GPU. The Intel also support facial recognition whereas the AMD does not. The Intel was more energy efficient and has a 29% longer battery life when compared to the AMD.\n\nI really appreciate your comment because it pushed me to dig deeper and helped me make a better informed decision. I was close to skipping a laptop upgrade this year, but based on Jarrod’s testing & how this newer Intel model performs and looks, I have changed my mind & am going to stop by BestBuy after work today to go ahead and place my order!\n\nIn case you wanted to see the comparison video I was talking about here is the link to it.

  "I just realized in the checkout that the Intel has the RTX 5060 GPU (the 5070 is available but at a +$400 price hike) vs AMD which has the RTX 5070 GPU. The sale price between these 2 is exactly the same at 1,699. I'm thinking about sticking with the Intel because of the new and improved chasis, both M.2 SSD ports being PCIe Gen 5 compatible, improved cooling, ports, wifi, battery life, energy efficiency, and RGB.",
  "Which laptop should I get? I’m looking into buying a new laptop and this 2 are my finalists. I will be using my laptop mostly for writing and some light video editing. \n\nWhich of the 2 should I buy or if anyone has one that doesn’t go over 1500 bucks please let me know ",

Traditionally i9 draws way more power and heats up a lot in laptops. Even when u play simple games like valorant that rely heavily on ur cpu but are not intensive at the same time, it reaches 80-85c when an i7 gets u almost same fps (a differece of 10-15 in AAA titles) but doesnt heat up as much. You can work with it and type, and also do vid editing. Unless you are into layering a lot of scenes or textures simultaneously (usually happens in professional vid editinf) you dont require i9. If its just for writing and vid editing i9 is an overkill. \n\nSo just check a vid that features legion's thermals and if u r fine with it buy the i9 one, if not try getting the i7 one",

  "Need Some Buying Advice I want to take advantage of the Black Friday sales to buy a new laptop, & would like some outside advice.  I've been reading & watching so many reviews that my head is starting to feel like it's overstuffed!  I live in rural NSW & there are no local computer stores for me to test laptops physically.\n\nI use the laptop for HOPA games, browsing & occasionally photo editing. My current laptop is an Infinity S7 (Intel Core i7-10875H, 16 GB RAM, 1TB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070) with a 17.3\" screen, which is 338nits. It has a mechanical keyboard, which I like & its weight is 3.6 Kg.\n\nI'm not concerned about portability or battery life, as I only use the laptop at home, but I don't want the new laptop to be too heavy since it rests on my legs.  My budget is AU$3,000.00 > AU$3,500.00, although I'm fairly flexible about that.  One of my main requirements is a clear, non-glare screen as I've had eyesight problems & I use the laptop in a sunny room.\n\nAfter searching various brands & models, I've been looking at the Lenovo Legion Pro 5 or 5i with 16\" screen.  I'd love to get a 17.3\" screen laptop again, but they seem to be out of favour with the laptop manufacturers.

  "Need Help Buying A Good Laptop🙌🏻 Hello Everyone, I want to buy a gaming laptop under 1.7lakhs. priority is mainly gaming and I am a little confused about some laptops. First one is Asus Rog Strix G16 2025 model with Ryzne 9 8940hx and rtx 5060, second is Acer Predetor Helios 16 2024 with i9 14900hx and rtx 4070 and the third one is lenovo legion 5 pro which hasn't released till now, so im waiting for that. Now the thing is there's no online review video about the asus one, so it makes it more confusing. The main problem with acer Helios is that i don't trust the brand so much so I don't know if that is a good choice. Im also confused if i should wait for lenovo legion 5 pro with oled display or buy the other one now. Can anyone also tell me if buying 5060 is better than 4070 or not? And is acer a reliable brand? As it'll be my  first time buying their product. If someone can help with these questions it'll be a lot of help🫶🏻",

  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget €2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years. As longevity is important, I believe performance is an important criteria. My current setup is an 8th gen Intel i5 Asus laptop (8/256) and a M4 Mac Mini (24/512) on the desk. I want to replace both of these items with a single Windows laptop and I'll sell the Mac. I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around €2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. €1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. €1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. €1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. €2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. €2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** €2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",
  "Have you ruled out Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024 or 2025)? It is a cheaper Asus ProArt with the same of internals.  These Asus model carry the best speakers of all Windows laptops which is nice to have if you have kids or others to share a screen.",
  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",

  "Dell XPS 13 vs HP Spectre 2-in-1 14 vs Samsung Galaxy Book 4 14” vs Lenovo Yoga 9i/7i Im trying to figure out what laptop to buy and its been driving me nuts for weeks now. I am a graphic design student and just need something to get me through my last year of college. \n\nMy requirements are:\n16+ GB of ram\n512+ GB ssd\nWindows os\nIntel or AMD\n14”\nDecent battery life\nSomething lightweight enough to carry up a bunch of stairs without breaking my back\n\nIm downgrading from a Lenovo Legion 5 Pro 16arx8, which I only had for a year. It was suggested to me by one of my grad student TA’s, and honestly I regret it. It was just too heavy for me to carry and I only used it for indesign at that point because it was just easier to use my ipad for photoshop and illustrator. \n\nThe battery life also sucked, only lasting maybe 4 or 5 hours when I have 3 hour studio classes, so on top of having to lug around a 5 pound laptop, I had to constantly have the brick of a charger with me too.\n\nI dont want to go through that again, and Im really hoping I can save some money by buying used. Im in a college town so theres a lot of people selling their barely used laptops for cheap, and these are just my strongest contenders. \n\nDoes anybody have any other recommendations or maybe advice? \n\nI tried r/suggestalaptop but I only got recommended the Acer Swift X and its a bit expensive for me and I’m constantly reading bad reviews about Acer as a brand.",

  "1700€ or 900€ laptop?? OBJECTIVES:\nI need a laptop for working in the summer and at the library, so I don’t have to carry my desktop and monitor. Remote work isn’t an option due to poor WiFi in cafes and libraries.\n\nPrograms I use: Houdini, Unreal Engine, After Effects, Premiere Pro, Blender\n\nLaptops Considered:\n\t•\tMSI Katana ❌ Poor reviews, cheap plastic build\n\t•\tHP Omen ❌ Selling old stock with black screen issues (might be fixed in 2025)\n\n\t•\tLenovo Legion Slim 5 (RTX 4060, 32GB) Good materials, solid cooling, positive reviews. The Slim version may not be ideal, but a classmate using it for Houdini says it performs well. \n\n\t•\tLenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 8 (RTX 4070, Ryzen 9, 32GB) €1699. Good performance, but Lenovo laptops reportedly overheat and die after ~5 years.\n\t•\tGigabyte Aorus 16X 9SG ❓ Great cooling system, but I don’t know much else.\n\n\nMY THOUGHTS: \nI need a powerful laptop but not top-tier—spending over 1000€ doesn’t make sense since it won’t match my desktop anyway. \n\nInitially, I considered the Lenovo Legion Pro 5 (RTX 4070, Ryzen 9, 32GB, 1TB) for Houdini and Unreal, but realistically, I only need it for Unreal (mid-high workloads) and video editing. Houdini caching/rendering isn’t worth doing on a laptop—it’s better handled by my desktop, and 13h+ caching would destroy battery life.\n\nSo, for just Unreal and video editing, is a €1700€ laptop really worth it, or would a cheaper one with an older RTX and maybe 64GB RAM (+€200) be a smarter choice? I got the money but I feel like spending 900€ more for this purpose would be more worth it to spend in improving my other pc specs. ",
  "Please help me decide if I should stick with mac or try the Lenovo Yoga Currently running a mbp from early 2015.

  "ThinkBook 16 vs Swift Go for multipurpose everyday laptop? Hi, first post here after reading TONS about laptop brands, multiple reviews, lots of 'best laptop for school' posts, youtube reviews etc etc. Yes, I am a student.

  "Vostro 7510 Review/ Advice Request  \n\nI really appreciated this (and other) reddit when I was searching for a laptop, and wanted to return the favor with a quick review of this laptop. I am not a formal laptop reviewer, and don’t have fancy gizmos to check nits or color accuracy, but wanted to share. I have only been using it for about a day or two, and I may or may not post some updates as I use this more. There’s also some chance that I will return it. \n\nModel: [https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations)\n\n(purchased on sale for $1150 + 10% CB).\n\nI wouldn’t mind some advice from the sub on whether to keep this or return for one of two slightly more gamery computers that will seemingly solve some of the issues I have with this - either the Lenovo Legion 7 Slim or the HP Omen 16.1 AMD (if it gets released on HP’s site soon enough). \n\n**Background:**\n\nI joined a small business and needed a laptop. I purchased my last laptop \\~11 years ago and while it aged gracefully… that's like 85 in laptop years. Business required that the laptop have Windows 10 Pro, and preferred that it have biometric security. I wanted it to be thin, and have good build quality so it will hold up well. I also wanted to be able to play the new AOE when it comes out (i.e., light RTS and 4x type games). Finally, I needed the laptop yesterday so I didn’t have time to wait around for the best deal.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\nI think this laptop falls short in a few ways: (1) it spontaneously shut down the first day I was using it. Enough battery, updated Microsoft drivers, and no indication of why when I turned it back on. Not sure what it was, but I updated the Dell drivers and it hasn't happened again in the few hours of use since that. (2) Battery life could be better, once I was down to less than 40% after about 3 hours of (non-gaming) use (downloading and installing some applications, light browsing). As I type this I have 2:56 estimated remaining at 77% of the battery on “better battery” setting. The battery estimate was also all over the place. I don’t think it’s fair to expect much more out of a 56 whr battery, but I think it is fair to expect more than a 56 whr battery in this kind of laptop. (3) The keyboard is ok - typing feels nice enough, although I liked my old Lenovo’s keyboard a little bit better. The backlighting is a joke. (4) Cooling. I ran Offworld Trading Company, which was free from Epic Games at the time I received this computer, and after less than 15 minutes of play I found the palm rest to be warm, and (using a food thermometer) found the temperature to be over 100 fahrenheit on the speakers, and about 127 fahrenheit right underneath the vents. The fans were noticeably loud as well. Task manager says the GPU got up to 65c. That seemed pretty warm for a few minutes of play on a 5 year old game.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\nThe strengths are in the specs: i7 with a 3050ti, aluminum chassis (there is a very thin plastic bezel around the screen, but it's small enough to get over. Pretty good build quality. Touchpad is spacious. It’s relatively heavy for a 2021 laptop, but it has a dGPU and is pretty thin. Screen is pretty nice and color accurate, although I suspect nothing special in 2021. And I will be able to play aoe4 on this (when it comes out). \n\n**Dell Customer Service:**\n\nI also wanted to call out a good experience with Dell Customer Service. Without getting into the details, they made things right quickly and followed up to make sure things ended up ok. \n\n**Request for Advice:**\n\nWhen I was looking at this I was also between the Lenovo Legion 7 slim which is a few hundred dollars more, but has a higher refresh screen and the 3060. I decided that because I am looking to play RTS/4x games that are typically not AAA graphically intensive, a 3050 would be enough and I would be better saving the money. \n\nI was also considering the new HP Omen AMD 16.1, but it still hasn't been released on HP’s website (where they have frequent 10% off gaming PC sales), and given that I need something now, I may not be able to wait until they can ship it.\n\nNow that I have used the Vostro, and have pointed out the above concerns, do you think I’ll get (a) significantly better battery life on one of those other options, and (b) is the cooling significant enough to cause problems with my use of the Dell?",
  "Just 1 question. Does it have 1 or 2 SO-DIMM memory slots??\n\nOne review said 8GB is soldered. One Dell maintenance manual shows 2.\n\nI'm between this and the 15\" LG Ultra with the GTX 1650 Ti. The Dell has the true full size number pad, but the LG's is the crammed version.  For me this is between soldered ram or not. If 1 is soldered, then I'll have a tough decision. \n\nSo, please pop the back cover and let us know?\n\nThanks!!",
  "I reached out to Dell. They confirmed its 2x SO-DIMM slots that support up to 64GB RAM!",
  "You’ll need to consider whether you want a gaming laptop or not. The Vostro is not a gaming laptop and won’t perform like one. It is a premium build quality well rounded business laptop with top specs. It will get hot when gaming over long periods of time. If you want something with more power you should consider the Lenovo legion slim 7 or if you don’t want a gamery feeling laptop the Ideapad 5 pro 16.",
  "Do you know if it has one or two M.2 SSD slots/what the storage upgrade options are like?",
  "Hi there, have you been able to play AoE4 on it since the release of the game and would you recommend this laptop for this game? I am looking for a decent laptop for everiday tasks, with a moderate price, and not especially oriented for gaming but I would love to be able to run AoE4 (but no other AAA games that are massively demanding on GPU, CPU and memory).",
  "I just got this laptop RTX3050 version, and I have to say, I believe the design around the battery life and cooling system is very poor. I thought mine is broken, after reading similar stories from other owners similar experiences are confirmed. I’m frustrated and disappointed with this product from Dell. The battery needing to be bigger and cooling system larger. IMO it’s flawed heavily. You can’t game on it either, the RTX3050 is very weak. The screen is average. Considered returning it for a different model but I’m too busy at work. \n\nWould not go with a dell laptop again. I could of paid slightly more and got a different manufacturer with better specifications and most likely none of these cooling and battery issues.\n\nSorry Dell, but this product is piss poor.\n\nEdit: ram dota2 as a test, can’t even get more than 30fps avg, 1080p max textures details. My desktop with Radeon RX5700XT and an old 6 core sandy bridgy CPU sits just below 200 avg\n\n30fps avg in an esports game isn’t playable.\n\nEdit2:  it sure what dell were targeting with its design, it can’t go anywhere without its charger very nearby. Poor gaming performance, terrible thermals. That leaves users with an always plugged laptop that only runs word processing applications and runs like a volcano doing it.\n\nEdit3: screen is 60hz. 2021 they release a mid range laptop with this? Dell are you high? Reason I bought it? It was 40% off. I almost got my boss one whilst awaiting shipping. Pretty glad I didn’t get my employer an absolute dud laptop, that seems like dell were trying to offload\n\nEdit4: finally. At work we run all dell emc servers. Lost a lot of faith on dell consumer, and as a whole if they are pulling this kind of crap I n 2021. We are due for a major upgrade, HPE looking much more convincing",
  "So good",
  "I would wonder why the GTX card if not gaming... I mean, the type of computing (ML, linear algebra) I use for work with an Nvidia card is more demanding than gaming.  If it can't handle gaming, then it can't handle a work setting that requires a GPU.  Otherwise, most workers don't need a dedicated GPU for work (with Word, browsing, etc).  Just puzzled, what's the point of providing a GPU that can't handle gaming.",
  "I have one, same specs as OP but regular 3050, not Ti. It has 2x m.2 slots. The OEM ssd is a very short m2 2230 drive. The other M2 slot can take a normal full length SSD. The short OEM 2230 ssd drive is in the longer m2 slot with a weird metal arm to anchor it to the screw down hole at the end. So if you buy one of these you need to move the OEM ssd to the other m2 slot, then stick your full length SSD in the m2 slot you just took the OEM out of.\n\nIt's easy, and already inside the case are the two heat sinks for SSDs. One small copper one for the OEM shorter 2230 ssd, and a full size heatsink for a normal m2 ssd. \n\nEdit: As per my reply to the other guy below, the battery life is absolute ass on this.",
  "I can run the new Diablo 2 resurrected/remaster on this at max graphics no problem, as long as it's plugged in. That game is a little heavier that you would expect on resources. My Ryzen 4800u with integrated graphics can only handle about low medium graphics. So this thing's pretty decent.\n\nDepending on what you're doing, keep in mind the **battery life is horrible** on this thing. I'm getting worse life than OP when just doing very basic light tasks. I get 3 1/2 to 4 hours max. This is with screen brightness low, no USB devices, the 3050 dGPU disabled, and just using a webbrowser. No gaming or streaming. I've done all manner of tests to squeeze out better battery life and have had not luck (OS reinstall clean, different drivers, setting max CPU usage to 30%, etc.). Dell support told me 4 hours is good battery life for this laptop and referred to the battery as a ***backup battery***.\n\nAlso, if you plan to dual boot to linux this thing won't sleep properly. You can set it to suspend, which defaults to s2idle and uses about 14% battery per hour. Manually modifying the system to deep sleep doesn't work properly, it will start to sleep, then spin up the fans and turn on the keyboard light. This is with Nvidia proprietary driver software and the dGPU off and iGPU on. After researching it, lot's of dell notebooks are doing thing. Dell's forums show things like \"this model doesn't support being set to suspend/sleep and put in a bookbag\".\n\nHopefully this info helps. I'm in the process of returning mine. It's a nice enough laptop, but averaging 3.5 hours of battery life from extremally light tasks with my mentioned battery saving attempts is bad, the linux sleep thing is bad too.\n\nIf you'll mostly be on AC power all day, you'll be fine. But if you're on battery it will not last. Gaming will kill the battery even faster, and it will lower its performance dropping the frame rate badly on battery.",
  "Hey I think your laptop may be broken or you are using it unplugged, because a 3050 usually runs dota 2 at around 120fps at the 65W. Do you run dota while plugged in? because it only uses the integrated intel graphics when unplugged which could explain the low fps.",
  "I ended up buying the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro with an RTX card, dual DIMM slots, and dual SSD slots.  It's a great laptop as long as you don't need battery life beyond 3-4 hours.  LOL",
  "Hey question, are you using windows 10 or 11? I know windows 11 has hit ALOT of laptops negatively in terms of battery life. I’ve heard some people getting up to 4 hours less than they would in windows 10.",
  "To tell the truth I didn’t run it more than a few hours on win10. I did find turning on battery saver made a difference, but it wasn’t major enough. I did also find apps like the brave browser automatically using the dGPU for no reason, setting windows to force it into the iGPU helped a bit.\n\nI did run manjero Linux and was getting batter battery life than when 11, but maybe just an extra 30 mins of light usage.\n\nOver all, I think the battery capacity (56Wh) is just a bit too low for something with an 11800h and dGPU. I tried buying an 86Wh battery from Dell before sending the Vostro back, but they don’t have them in stock.\n\nI moved to a Lenovo P1 G4. That has a 91wH battery, It’s easy to get 4.5-5 hours on that thing without effort.\n\nEdit: more info.",
  "Oh okay thank you for specifying more! Yeah brave turns on hardware acceleration by default for some reason. It’s quite annoying 😂 had a time I was wondering why my laptop fans were spooling up every time I opened brave and was always at a steady 10-30% usage.",
  "Yeah lol, I happened to be looking at task manager and noticed GPU_1 in use with just an empty downloads tab open. Need max power for that.\n\nOther than the battery life, I did really like that vostro.",
  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",

  "Can't decide between these 2 laptops, need help from someone with experience with 3d programs Hello everyone. I need a laptop for art school, something powerful (Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya, Blender.) And a good screen with good color accuracy.\n\nProblem is – my understanding with tech is limited and I know nothing about laptops, never own one in my life.\n\nFor the past few days I've done my research and found these two laptops :\n\n(these are my best options as far as my budget goes, the rest are just not as powerful/ not available in my country/ overpriced/ not worth ordering online after all taxes.)\n\n**Lenovo Legion 5 Pro 16ITH / 82JF003NIV / Ryzen 7 5800H / RTX 3060 / 512GB SSD 16GB**\n\n(roughly 2000 dollars)\n\n**HP OMEN Laptop 16-c0004nj / 4T9L9EA 2K / AMD Ryzen 7 5800H / 1TB SSD 32GB RAM / RTX-3070**\n\n(roughly 2060 dollars)\n\nFrom the reviews I've seen online, the majority are saying the Legion is just a better laptop. Better screen, better build quality, better performance. Plus, I've heard the Legion's 3060 rtx is very close/outperforms the Omen's 3070 because it has 30 extra watts.\n\n**BUT**\n\nThis Omen has 1TB and 32GB ram, twice as much as the Legion, and I'm not sure how much of a difference does it make, and if 512GB,16GB ram will be enough for heavy tasks at Blender, Maya, etc.\n\nPlus, I've heard the Omen makes A LOT of noise, which worries me a lot. Add to that the poor build quality, worse screen and performance. But again, I get the 1TB and 32GB RAM for extra 60 dollars, and it might be worth it, despite the cons.\n\nWhat would you do if you were in my shoes? that's a lot of money and I really want to make the right decision. Any help from the experts and the 3d users here will be more than welcomed.\n\nThank you very much for reading.",

Thanks btw. \n\nNow, the laptops I have my eyes on \n\nAcer nitro 5 (2021ver)\n\nAnd the \n\nLegion 5/5pro \n\nI know, I know, these two are very hot topics and the Legion 5 Is an all rounder for recent years and comparing it to a budget laptop might be a little unfair but like I said I might pick the cheaper choice if my money is bad \n\nBut hopefully there'll be a good price.\n\n\n🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️(Note: I live in Aus and laptop prices are not friendly. \nI'm using the laptops for work, hobbies and ofc gaming, I don't really need 60fps all day and night nor do I need ultra graphics, all I want is smooth gameplay and the ability to use it for tasks such as work and side hobbies like music production, maybe some animating, creation stuff etc. \nWhy I'm picking the Legion 5 when im low on cash is because I'm not about to have a laptop die in below 4 years of use I would at least want a laptop that can last for 5 years if the nitro 5 can do that that's great.)🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️\n\n\n🚶‍♂️Acer nitro 5 (2021ver)🚶‍♂️\n\nSpecs:\nI5 11th gen\n512GB SDD\n8GB RAM\nGTX 1650\n\nnow I've heard many things about this laptop, I've seen many reviews too, from what I've seen and heard the build quality and fans have a mixed feeling, some say it's terrible some says it's good but I have no idea which version they've used because the 2021 version was improved alot.\nI've also heard that Acer nitro 5 isn't good for other tasks it's more built for gaming so I would like to hear thoughts on that.\n\nThe price ranges from 700-1K \nIf lucky might score the 700$ one\nThe AMD ver of the nitro is... crazy... and I might as well go for the Legion instead with the Amd price.\n\nIs it worth for the price ? And is it good laptop for what I'm doing ? \n\n\n\n🚶‍♂️Legion 5/5pro🚶‍♂️\nSpecs:\nRyzen 5 5600H\n16GB RAM \n512GB SDD\nGTX 3050\n\n\nNow the Legion 5 as much as I've heard how it performs like a beast I have many questions and they haven't really been answered \n\nLike I've heard that The battery on this thing isn't the best and since I'm gaming on the side how long will the battery last ? \nOr maybe how do I extend it's life ? \nSome people say it lasts for an hour in gaming... which is pretty bad but the Legion 5 is a gaming laptop so is it supposed to perform like that?\nI don't mind having a wall charger but I'm not really experienced with laptops and my alienware has been walcharged because the battery was broken and all that was done by my friend so I have no idea how to do stuff like this myself \n\nNow also a thing about the AMD vs INTEL version of the Legion, I've heard that The AMD is good for multi tasking and battery life is better on the AMD? I'm not sure, do note me on that.\n\nI Also would like to know the difference between the pro and the 5 like what's the huge difference because here in Aus the lenovo website is really weird in display and I'm not sure which one is cheaper.\n\n\nSo overall is the Legion good for it's crazy price ? Is it worth spending like 500-800 more than the nitro? Does the performance meet to what I'm about to use it for ? \n\n\n\nThat's all I have to say thank you in advance for anyone who read this thoroughly I really appreciate, I really don't want to spend money in times like this especially when my money is low but I need it for work and I can't use my friends or head off to a pc cafe everytime I'm in urgency which is really what I'm doing atm.\nThanks!

  "Lenovo Legion is better built when I went to Best Buy and Microcenter to look at laptops. You shouldn’t game on battery alone, always plug it into the wall.\n\nI’d pick Lenovo. Its better out of the box since it has 16GB of RAM and a newer (but weak) 3050.",

  "Sometimes the numbers and naming on stuff isn’t better when reviews come out. An infamous example was the Intel 11900K.\n\nTop of the stack i9 Processor and very expensive, but it was a very low performing part and was overshadowed by some older parts.\n\nSo anyways the RTX 3050 laptop chip is very meh in terms of performance. You can do most stuff on it, but 4GB of VRAM and not a lot of power will make it suffer in demanding games. Also the laptop and desktop chips share the same name but they are very different.\n\nWhat are the prices on the laptops? I can’t imagine there would be a 500$ sifference between the two.",
  "I see, I have read something like this before where most of the older appliances outperform the newer ones \n\nIt's hard to say because at the moment prices are still high and sales aren't the best, there is a sale going on for the Legion 5 (Ryzen 5) atm but it costs 1599k and that's alot.\nSo what would you recommend ?\nThe acer nitro 5 has no sales atm and it's ranging from the prices of 1000-1800$ and all of them are intel.\n\nLast year in early mid December when my laptop was still working but dying I was browsing around and I found that the Acer dropped to a good 750$ with the specs I stated in the post.\n\nThe Legion 5 also dropped to about 1000-1200k which was quite a big drop from the price right now.

  "I have been Super happy with my ROG 15.  It is now 10 years old, still works great, quad core.   I have upgraded it from 8 to 24 gb, added an SSD drive, boots to Windows in 6 seconds even though it’s 10 years old.   I’ve had Lenovos and they are good too, but Thinkpads for work, not a Legion.   Both are great brands and I believe you will not make a bad choice with either.   Look at options for expand ability later.",
  "Help Finding a laptop Hello, I have $1300 in Best Buy credit and wanted some help finding a good laptop. I previously had a MS Surface Pro 7 and was thinking of getting something more powerful, as I will be beginning my Junior year as a CS student. I don't know much about specs and haven't really considered actually getting a gaming laptop until now, but I figured that if it can run games on it, then it should be able to handle future projects. Furthermore, I may try playing games that I currently play on console on it like rainbow six siege and rocket league. I also wanted to ask if gaming laptops are worth buying, or if I should stick with something like the Dell Inspiron. I was thinking of going with the HP OMEN:[HP  - OMEN Gaming 15.6\" Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory -  NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 - 512GB SSD + 32GB Optane - Shadow Black](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-omen-gaming-15-6-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-512gb-ssd-32gb-optane-shadow-black/6409146.p?skuId=6409146) \n\nbut I heard from other sites that it isn't really worth it. I was also considering the Lenovo Legion:  [Lenovo - Legion 5 15\" Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti - 512GB SSD - Phantom Black](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-legion-5-15-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1660-ti-512gb-ssd-phantom-black/6398969.p?skuId=6398969)\n\nMy third option is the Acer Nitro: [Acer - Nitro 5 17.3\" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti - 512GB SSD - Obsidian Black](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-nitro-5-17-3-laptop-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1650-ti-512gb-ssd-obsidian-black/6413248.p?skuId=6413248)\n\nI clearly do not know enough about the specs nor do I fully trust the reviews from Best Buy itself. Could I get some feedback on my choices along with other recommendations that are under $1300. Furthermore, would you all recommend getting the Geek Squad protection plan on it? I had it on my surface and the damage--cracked screen--was covered by the manufacturer's warranty; however, since there were no parts available to repair it, they went ahead and gave me the in store credit at BBY instead. I highly doubt that something worse than a cracked screen will happen to me, but I felt like it wasn't worth getting the GeekSquad protection, as it wasn't even required to cover my device. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank You for the help!",

Currently I'm using MacBook Pro 13 (Late 2012), which for university was perfect - lightweigth and long lasting battery. Since I'm used to MacOS and lightweigthness of it, it would be good to have a lightweitgh laptop. That’s why I’m considering to buy MSI GS65 Stealth Thin. \n\nCould you please help to decide, which laptop to choose? \n\nI have included a table with laptops that I find in my country, which is suitable for me. But now, I cannot decide which to pick, since everyone of them has good reviews.

  "I'd say get the G531. I'm a little biased towards Asus, sure, but it's the cheapest out of all of them, is tied for biggest SSD, has a perfectly functional CPU/GPU combo (unless you want to play AAA games at max graphics at 1080p - in that case, choose something with at least a 1660Ti, maybe the Zephyrus with the 1660Ti? It'll have the same advantages), and most importantly, has the best cooling out of all the units here, meaning it'll have the best sustained performance under load, which is very useful if working on big projects/compiling/rendering.",

  "HP does have a horrible custom support in my opinion... My HP laptop was broken so I sent it to the repair (HP repair centre). It took them more than 4 weeks to repair it... They changed the hole mainboard, but they downloaded a completely wrong BIOS system! So I would never buy a HP laptop again, because of this experience. I hope I don't sound too harsh... It is not really funny to miss a laptop if you need it for working. \nA good custom support is also a factor for a decision... Btw. I love the lenovo laptops !",
  "Lenovo legion 5 pro after 1 year, is this normal? I don't use it in dirty environments or in bed often, idk how it got so bad ",
  "Um. I think you do use it in a dirty environment. If years of university have taught me anything, it’s that people are nasty and don’t know it.",
  "[removed]",
  "[deleted]",
  "That's double loads in the dryer heavy.",
  "This photo contradicts what you wrote.",
  "this has to be a joke? right?\n\n1 year living in NON DUSTY enviroment?\n\nbro what you think we believe in Santa Claus as well? 😂🙈",
  "That’s insane. Clean it immediately. I know you said you don’t use it in a dirty environment, but this surely doesn’t happen from a clean environment",
  "Bro this is an insult to me.\n\nJust clean your laptop once per 6 months at least. And your \"environment\" once a week too.",
  "What the fuck",
  "If you don’t know how it got that bad, you are delusional.  You are 100% using it in a nasty environment.  I’m more concerned that you don’t realize that….this doesn’t happen in clean environments.",
  "Clean it immediately please.",
  "vape ?",
  "this must be a troll",
  "That is not normal. Clean it with an air duster, but hold down the fan so it doesn't spin while you are doing it.",
  "disgusting people are usually unaware of how disgusting they are",
  "Do you have pets?",
  "TIL: \"Dirty environments\" and \"bed often\" are very relative terms.",
  "you could build a pillow with all that dust",
  "Not dusty environment my ass",
  "Bruh…\n\nLooks like my ceiling fan if I don’t clean it every month or two… I live in the country where it’s always dusty. My laptop will be 5 years old in January, and just cleaned it for the first time. It wasn’t even a 1/4th that dirty.",
  "How is that fan even turning? Or is it not what the what is that",
  "No way this is a year of use in a clean environment",
  "there's a laptop in your dust",
  "WOW... this is insane for a year of use.\n\nI used my laptop for last 5 years and there is little bit of dust stack to blades of both fans, you can't even see the fan here.",
  "if you are using laptop on your bed then it's nothing to be amazed of how it's got this.",
  "Jesus your computer's life probably got halved with that much dust.",
  "No words",
  "You dirty pig 🤢",
  "Pet dander.",
  "That's mostly fabric, they're usually the ones that can clog, regular dust will just go-in then out the vents easily. It's a combination of how good the intake filter is and how much time do you use your laptop inside you room. 1 year cleaning interval is not normal, you may even consider it as neglect.",
  "The fan determined that’s a lie",
  "It's impossible to have a dust free environment, this is normal and you should definitely keep an eye on it. Ignoring it for too long can cause your computer to overheat. My motherboard was shot from overheating and this is probably why",
  "Does it void the warranty to open the laptop's case?",
  "Fans don't make dust... You do (lots of skin cells in dust). \n\nSo, this has been in a dusty environment this is why it's important to clean out laptops every so often. They will load themselves up with dust quicker than you realize",
  "Absolutely NOT normal, I fix laptops for a living and this is crazy bad for 1 year lol",
  "How often did you use it? For example I have a Asus TUF a16 laptop that got dusty after 3 months of having it and I used it everyday playing games all the time. I don't have a laptop stand so the fans didn't get particularly good airflow so that's why it got dusty",
  "Do you vape? the residue will attract dust.",
  "Have you been using it as a part time laundry drier?",
  "Lol take any cloth you own into a bright room and whip it around. That’s what’s in your laptop",
  "Is it turned on a lot? When the fans are spinning they collect far more dust than if it was turned off. When those fan blades spin at a higher RPM the friction in the air causes the fan blade to build up a electric charge which attracts more dust along the active edge of the blade until you get a sizable mass of it blocking airflow. I would say that looks pretty normal for a laptop that sees heavy use. Laptops don't tend to come with the filters you see in desktop builds so dust has easier time getting caked in there, especially with heavy use.",
  "Stop crying and just clean it",
  "One possible explanation is the fan is somehow spinning when it's in my backpack, but lid closed = sleep so idk how that can happen.\n\nEdit: I overlooked the obvious - my little brother took over my room and now I'm set up in my walk in closet. All the clothes probably release a lot of lint.",
  "No effin way. I’ve had my omen for 2 years, didn’t start using compressed air until 2 months ago, I have THREE dogs and a preteen so needless to say my house isn’t spotless…. Just took my laptop to get cleaned yesterday and got sent the picture of my fans and it still wasn’t this bad…\n\nWild. If this ain’t a troll, I don’t know what is ",
  "Cans of air are your friend.",
  "and pigs can fly too",
  "Maybe he traveled in the desert without your know .it happens",
  "your definition of clean environment seems questionable.",
  "God damn, that's hard to believe that it collected so much dust in 1 year. I have seen different laptops where it has been used for few years and didn't even collect that much dust as yours.",
  "Do you use any kind of cooling pad for your laptop? Where do you use it? Is is dusty there? \n\nBut first of all, just clean it dude...",
  "Just buy compressed air and blow it",
  "My 3 yo gaming laptop doesnt look like that when I 1st open it up. \nYou are living in dirty environment.",
  "Yes, if it is often used in a dusty environment.",
  "Having worked in the medical sector, while it looks clean, it’s likely not.",
  "This would 100% kill the the laptop from overheating over time",
  "I got a laptop early 2020, which I'm still using. I have never cleaned it, and there's maybe 5% of the dust in the fans that's in this picture. You definitely are using it in a dirty environment.",
  "Clean it and everything will be ok.",
  "Hmmmm, I should check my fans…",
  "oh my god no not normal must have been on carpet",
  "If you use your laptop 24/7 and leave it always running then yeah even in a clean environment this would make sense. \n\nI use my laptop occasionally over a few years and there was almost no dust in my fans. \n\nIt's important to vacuum your living space frequently and keep your laptop on a desk. If you have pets, they exponentially increase dust intake. Having this level of dust in one year just points at a high level of dust environment.\n\nI would clean it every 3 months if this is what you gathered over a year. You lost a lot of performance and efficiency overtime, you will gain it back once it's cleaned though.",
  "Very normal, just clean it, ignore the people bashing you for being filthy.",
  "I live in a dirty environment and my shit doesnt get that bad",
  "If you live someplace and you don’t dust and/or bathe often , you live in a dusty environment. Unless you are covering all your skin, you are releasing dust as your skin cells die, what did you think dust was?",
  "Companies fill in dirt pockets designed to burst after a year and clog your fan.\nThat or a dwarf steals your computer when you are asleep and games all night long on your laptop in a construction site.\nOr! You are a lizard and you loose skin flakes like crazy. Must be hard to keep the human disguise.\nNo other explanation is possible. \n\nWell.. could also be that even when you perceive your environment as clean, it's not that much dustfree.\n\n/S\nYes it's normal. Don't let it pile that much, buy a can of compressed air and blow a bit every month. Not a full clean just a few puffs is more than enough to keep it clean.",
  "Gaming laptops are not meant to be used a laptops. They work as a laptop but they're meant to me more of a portable desktop and used on a hard and clean surface while on A/C power. \nThey rapidly charge and discharge which will degrade the battery.\nIf you only have a couple of hours a day where it needs to function as a laptop then that's fine but if you can then plug it in and keep it off of your lap. \nRemember that when you set this laptop on your bed or lap it's going to be like a vacuum. Cat hair, dust, lint, crumbs, and everything else is getting sucked up. \n\nBuy canned air and clean it out every 3 months if this is how it looks after 12.",
  "Do you play right next to your dryer's exhaust? Like a load of lint in there. You should clean your fans and vents at the very least once every 3 months or when it has noticeable dust on it. You clean that up and you will think you got a new computer; it will be running so much better.",
  "You should be dusting it out every month or two",
  "One the plus side od things you can now make a pair of socks",
  "Replace laptop fans",
  "Floating fibers of fabrics in thin air can cause that and other unclean environmental sources..",
  "I've had my Y540 for over two years and only cleaned the fans once, and they were no where near this bad. And I take it to work everyday, and game at home every afternoon.",
  "get canned air and spray out your vents once a month. its called basic maintenance.",
  "If it looks like that after 1 year then trust me, your house is a whole lot dirtier than you think it is.",
  "Lick it",
  "That's dust and you'd likely be surprised how much dust is just in the air around you. One year is also too long to go without cleaning anything, no matter how dirty your environment.",
  "If you vape thc I've seen grimy dust that looks like that on my computer. Doesn't come off easily",
  "What the fuck\n\nYour environment is probably more dirty than you think it is.",
  "That’s honestly an impressive amount of dust. Usually it doesn’t stick to the fan much, it just collects on the heat sync. Definitely clean it, that much weight will hurt the motor",
  "“Lightly used, clean, perfect starter PC, 4500 obo, open to trades, no lowballs.” All jokes aside, your environment isn’t clean, my house produces dust like nobodies business too, just gotta deal with it for now. I’ve opted for a no case PC, so I just reach over and blow that bad boy out every day or 2",
  "Use more lotion..",
  "pets?",
  "Dust in the air isn't really just diet a majority of dust consists of insulation and dead skin cells",
  "Laptops should never be used on soft surfaces. Beds, couches, chairs, blankets, etc.. You said you don't \"often\" which means you do at times.",
  "Your pc can’t breathe",
  "You smoke inside?",
  "Bro dust your house first lol.\n\nDoor trim,  fans, electronics, blinds, picture frames, air vents, change your air filter, change your sheets, vacuum and mop.\n\n\nYou gotta do that stuff once a week or dust goes rampant.   Get a dehumidifier too.  That dust looks caked on like it wouldn't just rub off with a q-tip.",
  "A year? I clean mine every 2 weeks… a year? Explain a non dirty environment? Do you live in said environment? Then it’s dirty. Not saying you are a dirty human, but dry skin flakes off you everyday creating dust just like this. Plus there are things in the air you do not see that are ever present in your abode. Want it clean? Get a dehumidify and air purifier.",
  "Clean once a month or two with compressed air\n\nIts worth buying a cheap 3m air filter that takes A/D/H filters or you can run the furnace fan more often it does a good job cleaning",
  "If you use it in your lap, it’s just sucking lint and dust off you. Lots of factors to consider. Likewise the humidity around you. Seems like vacuuming or just running an air filter would be good, for your own health",
  "now you know why your environment is clean ......",
  "Animals, dust, dead skin, windows open in dusty areas all add this nasty. Change your furnace filter more often.",
  "Close to a heating and cooling vent? I know the desktop was bad for that",
  "Never set a laptop on a carpeted floor while using it, not only will it suffocate it but the dirt collect on the blades just like that.",
  "Pets?",
  "I live in a small town surrounded by farm fields, even though my apartment is kept fairly clean I have to clean my electronics filters frequently just because of the dust in the air.  If you have pets you may want to clean them more frequently.",
  "I've had a legion for about 4 years now. Leave it on 24-7. About 6 months ago I finally cracked it open cleaned it because I noticed dust accumulation on exterior fan intake mesh and it was nowhere near this bad. Granted it's just been sitting on my kitchen table all these years. Maybe that has something to do with the minimal amount of dust. It's literally just sitting there on all the time. Haven't moved it in years.",
  "So this is why you blow out your laptop fans often, doesn't matter what environment you think you're in. \n\nYou can also keep a bowl of water nearby or in the room that will mitigate it but not stop it.",
  "The mental gymnastics some people do on purpose",
  "Uh gonna be honest. You do use it in dirty locations. Thats rediculous",
  "Did you fuckin buy it used maybe? Lmao",
  "Not normal at all.",
  "If you haven't blown it out for 5 years, I would say yeah, expected. I try to blow mine out like 2x a year at least, regardless of conditions.",
  "Its Completely fine dude, you just have some laptop on your dust that's it! you're good to go with the cleanest environment you got!",
  "Mine didn't even get that bad after 4 years..",
  "Hey hombre - these other commenters don't have our machine.  I am an immaculately clean person, and my Legion 5 Pro builds up dust inordinately fast.  That's probably mine if I left it for a year.  I clean mine monthly, so should you.  But yeah, this is completely reasonable for the way this fan works for one year.",
  "Do ya smoke?",
  "Normal? The computer did what a computer does. \n\nYou on the other hand…",
  "Do you have a pet bird?  Those are pretty much living dust manufacturers.",
  "Excuse me wtf\n\nDo you have pets or is your house dusty ?",
  "Dust will always exist and even if you put it on a desk the the computer sucks up all of the junk that's small enough to get into it's vents cause it's impossible to have a 100% clean environment",
  "perfectly fine",
  "Questions;  \n\n\nAre you in a humid environment?  \n\n\nDo you smoke/vape?  \n\n\nDo you have pets?",
  "Liar You are dirty af",
  "Your home is much dirtier than you think it is…",
  "Ok how the hell it didn't take on fire? No ai wanna know 😂💀",
  "It seems that you already got answers, then I'll just add :\n\nWhen you clean it, don't forget to unmount it and check the filter (left of the vent), should be dirty as the rest.",
  "Lenovo is shit, thats prolly why.",
  "This has to be bait.",
  "Fine dust might not be visible to you, but if there is any on the desk, laptop fans will find it. That definitely needs cleaning. I have a Legion 5, and because of how the vent is designed, it's pretty obvious when it sucks up dust. The bottom intakes change color to grey, and that's when I clean mine",
  "X doubt",
  "Forbidden Cocaine",
  "While my fan does not look close to this, I can see through the venting that it does have some dust and debris caked on. What would be the best way to clean this as I’m a total novice when it comes to taking a laptop apart",
  "Take it outside, hold the fan blade from spinning, blast it with compressed air.  Repeat as necessary, maybe every 2-3 months.",
  "You in a nasty environment for sure.  Ignorance is bliss if you think otherwise.  Wtf",
  "Do you shut it down overnight? My 24/7 running dell wyse looks the same after 6 months of uptime. However, my PC and laptop are really clean after two years of normal use (6 hours a day)",
  "Only normal in a dusty environment.",
  "That is mostly dead skin. \n\nHow often do you take a shower? Once a month if you need it or not?",
  "Easy to clean. They still work, just not as well when covered like that, so not super end of world as long as you let it breathe normally. Take a clean toothbrush and turn the fan as you move the bristles along the fins to push the dust, then use some electronics grade canned air for the best results. Other kinds of canned air can cause Static damage to other components if used.",
  "This is exactly what mine looked like the first time I opened it up and I only have it on a desk. A lot of things can get sucked into those fans so just make sure to keep them clean and be a little more aware of where you put it",
  "If in a clean environment, this can happen if the laptop is powered on for long enough. If it's only 1 year old, and if the environment is clean, I believe you almost never turn it off.\n\nIf you do turn it off whenever you're not using it, then I believe your environment is not as clean as you think.\n\nAlso, if you or someone around you vapes, the vapor can cause dust to stick a lot more than it otherwise would. It could also be the case that there were just a few really dusty days and ever since it's been running hot and the fan is always running at top speed, collecting even more dust.",
  "And I thought my bedroom was a dustbowl for having nothing built up on the fan, and the heatsink fins themselves being about 1/4 lightly covered after two years daily driver use",
  "Holy crap that does not look normal. Surprised it hasn't died due to heat damage yet.",
  "How could you possibly say you don’t use it in dirty environments when the fan looks like that? Come on now.",
  "I thought this was a pudding",
  "Well the dust came from somewhere homie, laptops all use basically the same fans lol",
  "Dust is >80% human skin. You are the dust source",
  "I wish my wife were that dirty.....",
  "If that's the fan, I wonder how you lungs look like (0.0)",
  "lol. Just get a duster and get on with it. This is normal if you are in a forced air hvac setting.\n\nIf it's all radiant heat, you might have issues.",
  "How dirty is your place?!\nI didn't clean my laptop fans for almost 3 years and they barely changed color from the dust!",
  "It doesn't matter how clean thr house is, don't use a laptop on the fucking carpet, especially not a gaming laptop.\n\nThis makes me sick, get a board or something to set it on at least, how would you like if every breath you took, was through some dusty old carpet, would probably mess you up too.",
  "You have a cat or dog?",
  "Just think if this is your lungs. Not Good. Recommend cleaning almost every 3-6 months",
  "You'd be surprised about all the sources of dust. Does it sit on a desk? Dust. Does it sit in your lap? Dust. Etc. \n\nI thought my home was pretty dust-free until I got on the air purifier bandwagon. Whether or not the work, that's up for debate. There's no question about them removing dust from the air",
  "Vaping/smoking anything will cause it to condense on almost anything. A bedroom fan will catch a ton of it, and get dirty before a laptop fan. My old roommate vaped and did dabs, then came to me complaining about her fan being junked up. Her room is kept very clean but condensate and natural dust (as well as three cats) did a huge number on the fan and all its parts. Cleaned it out and applied a little wd40, took longer to get really nasty. \n\nBeing clean won't stop the natural accumulation of dust, and places where air moves a lot usually won't accumulate dust like this UNLESS there's moisture in some form. Weather that's from taking the laptop from cool to warm places or vica-versa, vaping nicotine or any plant materiel, taking it to the bathroom even after a shower or during can cause droplets to form on the blade. Even teeny, tiny droplets will pick up ambient dust. \n\nAnd there is dust. Dead skin cells, hairs, residues from cooking and even cleaning chemicals can create or disturb dust, and it'll settle or stick as it must. Best thing to do is clean that puppy as best you can, and do periodic dust checks on any form of electronics. Little old lady homes that are spotless will have PC and TV fans covered in junk from having a human around, and a liberal application of febreeze.",
  "No that much dust is not normal to be in your computer. Please clean it out 2hile you have the case open.",
  "Holy shit man. You have really bad dandruff.",
  "There's dust everywhere even if you don't see it lol...",
  "what the fuck? 😭 i need to go clean my laptop now asap how do i do it lmfao",

  "I bet you someone you regularly are around/ live with smokes inside.",
  "It's so bad that it looks beautiful.",
  "Normal? Its so dirty , your laptop is passive cooled at this point",
  "Also depends on the type of environment.\n\nWhile I was in Africa in a shipping container converted to living space while deployed my laptop after 8 months of not being cleaned didn’t have much dust inside.\n\nI get to Fort Bliss for demob and the thing is dusty again within 1 month.\n\nSince I been in Virginia about every 3 months for same build up however much cleaner living space",

  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",

On both T15 (Gen 1) and L14 they work well to start the fan sooner than the firmware does, but I do not know whether it is possible to delay the fan startup...\nThanks,\nP.S. : additional question : what is the lowest rpm that tpfancontrol can achieve ?",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",
  "For me, the biggest issues so far:\n\n1. Occasional phantom touches - similar to the OP\n\n2. eGPU compatibility (GPD G1) - it used to work with meteor lake laptop which I had (YogaBook 9i). Now I am not able to make it work stably with the aura. It will work for a minute or 2, then it will start to get disconnected, sadly.",
  "  \nI have had this laptop for a week. I have updated everything that needed updating (Windows and all relevant drivers). Everything is fine except for the Wi-Fi, which is very slow. I usually connect it to my phone’s hotspot (an S23 Ultra), and when I tested it with Ookla Speedtest, the download speed never exceeded 180 kb/s (0.18 Mb/s), while the upload speed reached up to 4 Mb/s. It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do? I bought this from BestBuy in the U.S., but I’m currently not in the United States. While returning it is not impossible, it would be very difficult, and I would prefer to resolve the issue without having to return it.",
  "It's not uncommon for Lenovo to list the same models next to each other with one being massively discounted!",
  "@[AetherSprite970](https://www.reddit.com/user/AetherSprite970/) Thank you for your excellent and thorough review. \n\nBased on your review, I contacted Lenovo and have confirmation that this laptop uses PWM, but does not use dithering. I will not be buying this laptop!\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 14in (2024) does not use either PWM or dithering.",
  "The PWM or dithering issue scares me from buying this laptop. Does anyone know if it's really an issue? I've read some other reviews of this laptop where this is not mentioned at all. Also does anyone know if the Asus Zenbook s 14 has a PWM or dithering issue? Thanks!",
  "I also am experiencing ghost touches too. Is it worth returning it over.",
  "u/AetherSprite970 Your reviews are excellent and so helpful. Thank you! As a person constantly suffering from eye strain, you've made me aware of the importance of looking beyond just the basic screen specs. In this case, this laptop is an absolute no-go for me based on your experience. I am wondering if iPads suffer from the same problem. I always thought my iPad Pro M1 should give me the most pleasant viewing experience of all my devices, but after just 10 minutes, my eyes hurt like crazy. Is it possible that modern iPads can cause eye strain too?",
  "regarding the Surface Laptop 7, why do you say that arm64 was a too big obstacle? because of some specific application?",
  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues. And if anyone has solved the above issues i'd like to know how to fix it. (I tried bloat removal and even windows reinstall but the issue still persists)",
  "I ended up on a similar journey and settled for a Zenbook S14 on sale. Lenovo's support and broken shipping killed the company after the 7i Slim had system stability issues and would freeze up. ",
  "It has been over 5 months now --- is anyone able to provide an update ?\n\nAre these issues still a problem, or have software updates fixed the problems ?",
  "re the touch pad - i usually use a wireless mouse so not worried about that.\n\nGood report, i'm seriously looking at one, now using a HP Specter 360. its been good for 7 years but falling apart now, This Lenevo is getting good reviews.",
  "I just got the Lenovo Slim 7i 15.3\" Aura Edition.\n\nThe Bluetooth is abysmal.  I can pair all devices, but they will NOT STAY CONNECTED.\n\nThey will pair, then connect, then DISCONNECT.\n\nALL of them.\n\nI tried everything to no avail.\n\nI even installed the Intel Driver Update utility, and installed the official Intel drivers for the Display, Wifi, and Bluetooth.\n\nNope - the Bluetooth will simply NOT (stay) connected.\n\nIs this a Windows 11 issue, a Lenovo Hardware issue, or an Intel Software issue ????\n\nTons of people out there with this problem - and nobody has found the solution.\n\n(and by the way, yes, I went into the wifi and bluetooth devices and UN-selected the option to allow the computer to power down the devices to save power.)\n\nOther than that, the laptop works fine.",
  "Ya I think final thoughts are if you don’t primarily require windows that an apple MacBook Air is unassailable at this point by any competition. The hardware is on a different planet",
  "Thanks for the eyestrain section! Not a lot of people talk about this but I think more people than we think are affected by this.",
  "Any body used Samsung book5 Pro 360? any comprative review.",
  "man, it's not like trackpads are a new technology. Why is it so hit and miss with laptops?",
  "I've been thinking about getting this laptop, but I'm curious just what that ARC graphics chipset is capable of.  Has anyone by any chance tried any PCVR games for Twitch streaming on it?    \n  \nI know it obviously isn't meant for that.  I have a gaming PC for this purpose.  But I'd like to do some PCVR on this laptop while away even if it were a marginally painful and degraded experience.  Can it do it even at low settings?",
  "Gave up on windows. Mac won the game. Unless you are absolutely required to run windows in a way that cannot be done with an ARM chip, buy a Mac. Threw up my hands and got a MacBook Pro. Always works. Day three and battery is at 60%. What are we even talking about here",
  "Looking for a laptop and was considering this. What are some brands/models that are better than this? Would appreciate some recommendations.",
  "It’s bright, definitely glare but turned all the way up it is usable",
  "I own the yoga slim 7i aura and it is honestly the worst computer I have ever owned by far. It is super buggy. It crashes and randomly restarts regularly (about every other day). It has graphical glitches (I have seen screen tearing when doing simple things like scrolling a word document). Tons of audio glitches with headphones frequently disconnecting. It is honestly just a terrible computer overall. Worst computer purchase I have ever made by far. I would highly recommend against buying it based on my experience.",
  "I had it for 1 week now and i will return it. The touchpad issue is so bad and i havent seen this conversations before. First the fans are always on, even on energy saver, just chrome some tabs and they are on. Not crazy loud but they are on. I had Premium care and a technician support. the problem with the touchpad is in the bios \" intelligent cooling\", set it to \"perforamce\" and the touchpad wont sleep,  and works. negative is that the fans then are even more loud. at the end i sent it back and bought the sl7 arm, love it so far.",
  "I had the Yoga Slim 7i aura edition for 1 week and gonna return this crap.   \nLove the screen, performance and battery but slightly pressing on the middle of the keyboard deck shuts the laptop down as if it shorts itself. \n\n\\- Fan sounds like a 1.9tdi   \n\\- Screen flickers when volume up/down  \n\\- shorts itself when slightly pressing on middle of keyboard  \n\n\nVery good laptop for only $1200 CAD but too many flaws.",
  "What is the battery life like?",
  "It could match a MacBook Pro though, and still be a horrible laptop. For example, unless it's one of the newest MacBook pros, you might be used to an incredibly glossy screen that leads to a busted user experience if there are windows or uncontrolled lights nearby.\n\nMy M1 Max MacBook Pro was also incredibly laggy for things like window snapping and some other things where I couldn't get rid of the animation and you just have to wait for part of a second from time to time before you can do things.\n\nPretty amazing that it compares to a multi-thousand dollar laptop, but also multi-thousand dollar laptops these days can be pretty disgusting, or at least that has been my experience with the M1 Max, and some Windows laptops from Dell, Asus, and Framework being laggy with windows 11.\n\nMaybe it's just a software problem though and I shouldn't be comparing wildly inefficient operating systems like Mac OS and Windows 11 to things like debloated Windows 10 or Linux on a 12-year-old Thinkpad originally rated for 24 hours of battery life.",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "How do the speakers compare to the MBP?  Thx",
  "I currently have the G16 and the aura and when it comes to speaker quality, these two are pretty close. the G16 has a slightly fuller bass and slightly wider sound stage. In my opinion if the G16 are a 10, the Aura speakers are a 9.5. I also feel the browsing experience to be much better on the Aura. I experience more lag on the G16 and the fans kick on, the SOC can get too hot for the G16 to sit on the lap, even with light browsing. That being said the track pad on the G16 is better. while the keyboard on the Aura is much better",
  "I was thinking of buying this but it has way too much bass, since I listen to music a lot that's a dealbreaker for me. Also, the bass resonates across the laptop body which creates a weird sensation if you're typing while listening to music. I tried adjusting equalizer in dolby software but still couldn't get the sound right. Did you find a solution to eliminate bass (so chassis doesn't resonate) and music becomes clear?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "I just did, looks good from any angle.",
  "Thanks for your review. I finally decided not to buy this model (it's in my cart for a few days).",
  "Thanks for the insight. Where did you see others complaining about the touchpad issue? If it's not isolated to my machine I'm afraid it may be drivers / firmware.",
  "sounds like an issue with Intel ultra series 2 to be honest.  \n  \ncan anyone who has tested other series 2 intel laptops confirm?",
  "I wud return it for the annoying spinning wheel alone",
  "I wish the X1 carbon line still had good IPS panels. OLED isn't for me. P14s gen 5 has a nice 120hz 3k IPS, I might consider that one.",
  "Hey, I'm thinking of picking up this machine, but I'm curious to know how much battery life you're getting?",
  "Haven't tried any other Lunar Lake laptops as of yet. There will allegedly be a SL7 for business with Lunar Lake next year, thinking about waiting for that. Though knowing Microsoft they'll charge an arm and a leg for 32Gb.",
  "I also posted a review of SL7 a few months ago if you wanted to have a look. The SL7's display is pretty comparable to the Aura's. It had worse PPI (201 vs 222), and worse subjective calibration making it bit washed out, but didn't have the IPS glow issues of the Aura. The AR coating was also better. I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve. The chassis would get way too warm in heavier tasks and the fan would hardly do anything. But still, I prefer the SL7's acoustics. No noise in a docked setup.",
  "Cant seem to get it working on the Aura.",
  "What did you uninstall? ",
  "Which bloatware did you remove?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "Thanks for the recommendation on uninstalling the bloatware.  Any update on the laptop?",
  "It's annoyingly reflective. And it's a pitty because under the perfect conditions it's really nice to look at. But it's a laptop so conditions change and are rarely perfect",
  "Is it a problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "The low RPM noise isn’t too bad, it’s just the fact it’s there at all that irks me. It’s completely unnecessary to have such an aggressive fan curve with a Lunar lake chip inside, but I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker. \n\nThe eye strain comes from the GPU, not the glossy display surface. Same strain when docked. Seems to be recent intel GPU’s from what I’ve read, causing issues for those sensitive to dither, or whatever rendering technique it is that causes the pain.",
  "The Aura screen dimensions are compatible with the MacBook Air 15. Get a MBA 15 compatible matte screen protector, and it'll greatly reduce glare and reflections on the Aura.",
  "was this 16 or 32gb of ram?",
  "BTW, as an update to my experience, I have my touchscreen replaced as it seems to be touchscreen issue instead of touchpad. For a week, touchwood, no such touchpad issues anymore.\n\nThe only remaining gripe I have would be the lack of compatibility with my GPD G1.",
  "Have you uninstalled McAfee already? It will greatly improve system performance. The Microsoft antivirus software built in Windows is better. That's probably the first thing to do after unpacking a new Lenovo laptop.",
  "It's really subjective. Do you have any issues with other modern devices? In laptops I find Intel Xe iGPU's to be bad for eye strain, Nvidia perfectly fine, AMD tolerable but not ideal.",
  "For my ghost touches issue, turns out I went to Lenovo repair centre to have screen replaced, then as of these weeks the ghost touch issue is gone for me.",
  "how did it go? did you send it in and is it still working?",
  "Hello \n\nI am going to buy this laptop soon.\n\nIs there display glare problem a deal breaker?  \nSome people mentioned : glossy displays leading to poor battery life because you have to crank up brightness to max to combat glare.\n\nThanks",
  "Its not easy to buy a laptop nowadays. many models and there are issues on each model. No windows laptop is perfect it seems, unless you pay big amount to Thinkpad series highend one.",
  "Luckily the 15.3\" screen is the same size as the Macbook Air 15, so you could pick up a matte screen protector.",
  "[I just reviewed it](https://smbtech.au/features/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-aura-edition-laptop-review/) and got 26.5 hours. That's a new record on my site.",
  "After using for some time, I think it’s similar to surface laptop screen. It’s reflective but with decent resolution. Colors are vibrant. I mostly work inside so it’s been fine. Working outside might be slightly tough because the screen is pretty reflective (not as good coating as MacBook). If you turn up the brightness to 100% that might make it better for outside work.",
  "I think the same, if not even better.   So loud and clear and good bass too.   I've tested both the 14\" and the 15.3 and had zero issues.  I think the one this person is talking about was just a lemon",
  "Not really, I just got used to it.",
  "Barely but yes. You can be outside (in the shade of course) and make do while in light mode. It's a mirror though, so you gotta find the right angle.",
  "Thank you so much - I really appreciate it. This makes it a buy for me. ",
  "Glad I could help make that tough decision! Not many choices right now that are similar to Yoga 7i Aura Edition but hoping we get some new releases soon...",
  "I read about a couple folks mentioning unresponsive touchpad in some YouTube comments and in r/lenovo comments as well",
  "You probably don't need this anymore but its around 8 hours minimum for demanding stuff, WAY higher with regular use. Much more than one needs. If you plan on using it for several days in a row, just bring the charger.",
  "As I sit here looking at my non-upgradeable to Windows 11 Surface Book 2.  You felt and looked premium, I paid a lot for your middle tier processor, I learned what heat throttling was, sometimes you think the screen is disconnected when it isn't, we had a good run. No more MS laptops for me thanks.",
  "Just read it, some great detailed insights there. Definitely swaying me towards getting the SL7, especially given the low/no noise from the fans which is very important to me. Thanks for replying!",
  "How would you compare the screen reflectivity between the SL7 and the Aura? Still waiting for my Aura to arrive",
  "OK, thanks for trying, it is good to know that it is not compatible... by the way, there are several variants, depending on the model (eg 1 or 2 fans) : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qjlal2/tpfan_control_on_newer_thinkpads_share_your/\n\nOn the Aura, there is also a built-in BIOS configured power management, accessible through Fn+Q command : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1fufeoa/lenovo_yoga_slim_7i_aura_edition_ama/lqcjek5/",
  "What if you set the performance/fan mode to quiet? Does that make it quiet enough? I'm thinking of getting this too and have heard mixed reviews about fan noise",
  "Ya, it’s been hit or miss on battery life. Touchpad gets finicky w longer use, appears to be pretty sensitive to the oils on the skin and any grime so I try to use the mouse. I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",
  "Its actually not too bad in person (at best buy) when viewed side by side to the book 4 screen.   I think the book 5 screen has more anti-reflective coating and they did not have that model for testing.",
  "Is the reflection problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "Does anyone tried this?",
  "It had been on sales for £1100 for the Aura 258V 32GB RAM model in the UK (e.g. Lenovo Store, Currys).",
  "Yes the 32 GB version with Intel 258V. Seems like some of the discounts are now gone.",
  "I have the same ghost touch issue, sending it in for repair under warranty in 2 days.  \nhow was you experience with the repair and is it still working?  \nAsking since i have heard many bad things about Lenovo's repair service.",
  "May i ask if you’ve found a solution for connecting to the gpd g1? I am looking to buy a compact egpu to use with the slim 7i aura on the go. 🙏",
  "That was one of the first things I did",
  "I'm looking to replace an old Dell XPS 9360 laptop with the following specs: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz 2.00 GHz. If I had no eye strain issues with this, do you think I should be ok with the Slim 7i Aura?",
  "Tell me how the type of graphics card can affect eye strain. Eye strain and other discomforts are caused by PWM and temporal dithering. These are defects or characteristics of displays, and intervening components are unlikely to be the cause, but I could be wrong. Please comment.",
  "I exchanged it",
  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast. The screen is very glossy though. if you work in a very bright room with bright background/light behind you, then yeah it can be very annoying to clearly see your reflection on the screen even at 80% brightness. it's depends see if you can find a sample in the nearest store.",
  "I like your little candy cane for scale",
  "Can you share me the settings that you have used while testing this and was there any major tweaks done to this? I got the same laptop but seems like my idle drain is little bit higher, although I did clean install of windows.",
  "Is it good?",
  "HP's new OmniBook Flip looks good, but its battery is a bit small. Maybe I'll wait for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura edition. It'll be very expensive at the release time though.",
  "A few alternatives appeared in recent months:\n\n[**MSI Prestige 14 AI Evo C1MG**](https://smbtech.au/features/msi-prestige-14-ai-evo-c1mg-laptop-review-2024/) – MSI’s, matte-screened 14-inch, business-oriented rival is larger, but more powerful.

  "Ah, interesting. Looks like a universal issue then.",
  "Both are glossy glass surfaces, but I remember the SL7 looked less reflective. The aura can look a bit mirror-like at times.",
  "My bluetooth is awful.  I can pair all devices, but they will NOT stay connected.  My earbuds connected, and I was able to use them for about 1 minute or so, but I could only get the Right side to receive sound.  There's something very very broken about the bluetooth on this machine.  It has been out since 2024, and it is shocking that it is still not fixed !!!  The internet is full of people with the same bluetooth issue.",
  "Yes, a few people on reddit shared their experience of this already. They said the outcome is comparable to the new M4 nano texture screen coating. Less reflection but more grainy, as you would expect.",
  "I am going to buy this laptop soon. \n\nIs there display glare problem a deal breaker?\n\n  \nSome people mentioned : glossy displays leading to poor battery life because you have to crank up brightness to max to combat glare.\n\nI am a software developer, i opened many tabs, run heavy tools like docker, visual studio and local database servers.",
  "You could try to check if the problem is related to your Windows install, or a hardware issue (e.g. WiFi chip, antenna connection). \n\nOne relatively easy way would be to create a Linux bootable USB stick (e.g. Ubuntu). Boot up from the Linux USB stick and check the WiFi speeds. \n\nIf the speeds in Linux are normal, you could then try a \"clean install\" of Windows (download Windows USB install media from Microsoft website).\n\nIf the WiFi speed in Linux is also very low, then it might be worth opening up the laptop and checking the WiFi chip and antennas (does not void warranty). Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",
  "Did you exchange with the same model? Or what else did you get instead?",
  "Understand it looks like a deal breaker to me, however spec is really good on this pc.",
  "this comment is making me crack up ideky",
  "Disable all start-up apps, put it in flight mode, ensure all drivers and apps are up to date, drop the screen to the lowest visible setting, ensure it's cooled down before running the test.",
  "ThinkPads have great build quality, the 14 inch a bit too small for me tho. HP removed top firing speakers form Omnibook and no more USB-A port either.",
  "That's a nice list, thanks.",
  "I can see you currently have ranked the [MSI Prestige 14 AI Evo C1MG](https://smbtech.au/features/msi-prestige-14-ai-evo-c1mg-laptop-review-2024/) at #10 due to the price of your printing of **$1,899** (was formally your #1) with an Intel Core Ultra 5 (125H).  \nIm seeing priced at $1399 across multiple webshops sporting an Intel Core Ultra 7 (155H) - to me that represents even greater value, do you think its battery would be as efficient battery wise as the (U5-125H) that you reviewed?",
  "Yeah, for some reason it worked fine for me or maybe I just didn't notice it. I think a few BIOS updates can fix some of these pesky annoying issues in otherwise an ideal laptop.",
  "Now I'm thinking to just get the Yoga Pro 9i with the IPS. Should check all the boxes. Just not the battery life",
  "It is a glossy screen, so some glare is there, but not anything significant to be a deal breaker. Battery life has been excellent so far, usually lasts 5 to 8 hours on a single charge of 80%.",
  "Thank you for these suggestions, and I think I will try it. Can you please provide me with a link to such a Linux Bootable Stick download? I know I can search for it, but I feel you can provide me with a tested (and safe) solution.\n\nmeanwhile I found an acceptable solution using a tp-link wifi dongle",
  "Oh you got it wrong buddy I mean what's the best optimal settings that's not compromising performance and battery life",

  "The 9i looks like a nice machine especially with mini-LED, but the chassis is quite cheaply made, like the Pro 7. All plastic interior, including the hinge assembly.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

  "hi I am someone using this laptop for a month. Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo. I have a desktop that goes 165hz and that's more for gaming. sure it's smooth and all but eh not worth the batt life tradeoff).\n\nif you realllly wanna stretch the life, use MS edge as ur browser cuz that's the least battery draining browser out there.

Unfortunately, she decided return the laptop after just one week as the case kept splitting open at the front under the touchpad. This indicates some poor built quality. I tried it out myself for a bit and also found the feeling and aesthetics rather on the cheap and plasticky side. The system also felt very sluggish and performed poorly in everyday web browsing and office tasks.\n\nAfter the MSI Prestige, I recommended my friend to get a full aluminium Lenovo Yoga 7i 14\" instead.

  "Yep, trackpad is good, I can very comfortably scroll and browse websites without having to touch my mouse at all",
  "Coding will be no sweat for this machine, the ryzen 7 4800h is more than powerful enough. But gaming... depends on the games you wanna play, for AAA titles I'd say maybe 4 years max, and that's playing games on minimum settings. Because the GPU isnt a high end card for today's standards so 6 years down the line... yeah probably not gonna be too good",
  "Its lenovo vantage, it came pre installed in the laptop",
  "Yep its quiet when not under heavy loads, if you're really worried about noise, the laptop can be set to quiet mode, so the laptop will automatically limit the speed of the cpu and gpu to keep fan noise down. As for using it on my lap, not the most comfortable because of its weight, and the damn numberpad at the side, because it means you cant rest your hands on the laptop in a symmetrical position to ensure the laptop stays balanced on your lap",
  "Trackpad feels good, sensitivity isnt way too low like my friend's laptop, and if you find it too sensitive you can lower it in the settings. Based on settings it does support windows 10 gesture control, it has 3 finger gestures and 4 finger gestures. Battery life is just shy of 3 hours on the balanced mode, but based on another reviewer, when set to the power saving quiet mode, it's just shy of 4 hours, but there are ways to improve the battery life but at the expense of performance of course. \n\nI bought this laptop purely based on specs and my personal faith and preference for lenovo products",
  "I find the gtx 1650 enough for me, I used to play using a nvidia 940mx so what you guys feel is subpar gaming performance to me is amazing gaming performance",
  "Yeah but a downside is that the webcam doesnt support windows Hello face recognition",
  "I disagree, I actually feel the build quality is great and the whole thing feels really sturdy, the hinges too, nothing about this laptop makes me feel the slightest bit of concern",
  "I paid 1556.47 singapore dollars which equates to 1115.75 usd",
  "Intel 10th gen CPUs when compared to AMD 4000 cpus are shit and far behind in performance",
  "I cant say for the 7I but mine certainly feels sturdy",
  "1. Yep it feels really sturdy, probably helped by its extra thickness, I generally disagree with those who say the hinges feel weak because when I opened it, it actually gives me good confidence that this machine will last, but who knows maybe it might weaken over time.\n\n\n2. Trackpad works great, it's really precise, I can comfortably lean back and use 1 hand on the track pad to browse websites, no need to pick up the mouse at all, only gripe is the number pad making the touchpad off centre and it just bugs me. As for keyboard, idk how to review this because I've never used what's objectively deemed a bad or lousy keyboard, but lenovo said they did copy the thinkpad keyboard design so I dont think you'll face any issues or discomfort. I personally find it comfortable.\n\n\n3. I took the 60 whr option as I needed a 1tb hdd to store all my school related stuff, but I'm not sure if the AMD version even has the option of the bigger battery. As for battery life, I'm actually about to test it, I've been running the laptop on battery conservation mode since I got it to prolong the battery lifespan, so I'm getting it to 100% now so I can start testing it, will update you when I got results",
  "Right results are in, so from 100% at 60% brightness the laptop lasts 2 hours and 41 minutes. This is running YouTube, Microsoft word and discord at the same time, I even had my webcam turned on for an hour, so without that itll probably last just about 3 hours",
  "build quality feels really good, the laptop as a whole just feels pretty sturdy. I think this laptop will last no less than 3 years, note im not someone who games on ultra settings, i am content gaming on low settings and lock to 30 fps, so if you have big gaming expectations, no way this will even last 2 years for you. As for battery life, im testing it as im typing this reply, im running on medium power setting, with youtube and microsoft word running at the same time to get a more accurate result",

  "Idk, you should go email lenovo for that",
  "The screen I chose is only 45% sRGB but 120hz. But if you need 100% sRGB for content creation, it is available too, but only 60hz and it needs a additional $10. Build quality wise, it is solid, it feels robust",
  "I cant measure it, I dont have any equipment. But it isnt ridiculously loud even at performance mode, with my game volume at around 50, I can hear my game clearly, or with headphones on, can't hear the fans at all",
  "Same here, I personally never use the number pad and would have much preferred if they used the space to give the keys more space between each other, I'm still regularly hitting the wrong keys because I've always used the touchpad and sides of the keyboard to align my hands",
  "I would say AMD, more cores for lower price, and especially if you top up to get the ryzen 7 4800h, it can match the performance of the latest i9 10980hk",
  "I never heard of a legion 5 coming out on june 21st, is that just the release date for your region?",
  "Speaker sound is abit soft for me because I have it propped up off the table using these little rubber pieces on each of the 4 corners, so the bottom firing speakers arent able to have the sound bounce off the table, but the laptop does come installed with Dolby Atmos for gaming, and in jedi fallen order, there was a 7.1 surround sound option for audio. As for heat, generally most of the heat is towards the centre of the computer, near the hinge and away from the main WASD keys, so no major concern of keys being hot to the touch",
  "Nope, but I already had a permanent subscription on my Microsoft account, so logging in was all I had to do",
  "Unfortunately the option for a gtx 2060 is not available yet, lenovo said it will be coming later in the year, so I dont know anything about how much it would cost",
  "In the bios, there is switchable Graphics. so u can turn it on. In addition, Lenovo vantage allows you to toggle the hybrid mode which means it only activates the dgpu only when gaming or other gpu intensive stuff",
  "Fan noise isnt very much, honestly when I was playing more demanding games like jedi fallen order, having the volume at 50/100 was enough for me to hear all the game audio very clearly over the fan noise, as for the LOL test, I'm not a league of legends player but with how low the requirements to run it are, I'd imagine 120 fps should be no sweat for this laptop",
  "I ordered on 22nd may, UPS delivered it to my door on 3rd June",
  "Uh, any idea on how I could run a test?",
  "Pretty decent, the only benchmark worthy game I have is jedi fallen order, I get a very consistent 80+ fps, occasionally it dips to around 70+ fps. This is on the max settings.",
  "By the way, you can still consider buying the AMD version, lenovo will be adding the option for better GPUs later this year, up to a rtx 2060",
  "Nope, processor has never exceeded 82C ever, and GPU never exceed 66C, this is playing jedi fallen order on epic settings",
  "only intel variants. But in the bios, switchable graphics is available. Hybrid mode on lenovo vantage works similar too",
  "It's not battery saving mode which stops the charging at 60% its conservation mode, in Lenovo vantage there is rapid charging and conservation mode. As for the keyboard backlight, I have the issue too, but honestly it's quite a insignificant problem since the backlight does still work",
  "I ordered with student discount, without it you should be able to get similar spec just that instead of ryzen 7 you can probably only get the ryzen 5.\n\nAs for lenovo customer support, amazing honestly. Every time I've emailed the Singapore lenovo customer support, I get a reply the next business day, some times even just a few hours after I sent the email. Plus there's quite a funny story with how I got my laptop so fast.\n\nThe story is that when I ordered it, the product page says expected to ship within 6-8 weeks, but then the next day it changed to ship within 4 weeks, so I wrote a email to customer support asking to clarify, the rep apologized and said he'd help me email the shipping team to expedite my order and the next thing I knew, my laptop was shipped out in less than a week. Reached my house in 10 days.\n\nIf you want a cheaper option with similar ish specs, L340 Gaming is your best bet, has the same gtx 1650 but only a  i7 9750h",
  "I got mine for SGD$1309+ 93(GST)\nRyzen 7 4800H\n512SSD\nNvidia Geforce GTX 1650\n300nits 144hz screen\n\ni used the coupon code CUPONATION15 to get 15% off. (Shaved off almost 250 off)[Found it by googling lenovo discount code]\n\nOrdered mine on 3rd july tis yr prolly still works>",
  "There are 2 m.2 nvme slots, but you can choose to have a hdd instead if you want cheaper storage, but you can always remove it in the future to install your own nvme ssd. As for the single channel ram, I cant say for sure, since the ram is running at 3200mhz, considerably faster than the intel counterparts, it shouldn't struggle to run anything unless you've got loads of apps running at the same time",
  "Seems really average, just a standard 720p camera you will find in many other laptops",
  "What do you mean by tint? And yes you can add a 2.5 inch HDD, I have one added. Y540 has slower processors, 9th gen i5 and i7 are no match for ryzen 5 4600h or ryzen 7 4800h. Y540 has slower ram, 2666mhz vs 3200mhz, Y540 has smaller battery 52.5wh or 57wh vs 60wh or 80wh. But y540 has gtx 1660ti",
  "You can change the refresh rate and theoretically it should improve battery performance",
  "also... where dat rgb at?",
  "I'll get back to you on the exact numbers because although I've been playing a lot of GTA V recently I never paid too much attention to the temps, but every time I glanced over at the on screen display, it always hovered at around 60-68C, take these numbers with a massive pinch of salt, I dont think me looking at temp reading once every 20 mins or so can be too accurate",
  "Nope, no problems at all",
  "10 days after ordering, it reached my doorstep",
  "No soldered ram at all, 2 empty ram slots. Ryzen supports speed up to 3200mhz for ddr4. You can put up to 32gb ram, I have a 8+8 config",
  "With Hybrid mode on, window battery saving 40% brightness, mine lasted 5hrs [I was using the Lenovo gaming mouse tho so that might had drained battery too]",
  "It's the 120hz, I dont even notice the supposed lack of color, maybe its just me. I've never had high end machines before",
  "Thermals are really good, I've played gta v and jedi fallen order at max settings and CPU never crossed 80C and GPU never crossed 68C. The screen problem is exaggerated. The reviewers need to criticize it and in terms of the specs of the screen it is very easy to bash it because it is inferior to many other laptops out there. But using it as my daily driver, I dont even notice it",
  "Nope, but no big deal for me, I can still click on the battery indicator on the taskbar and just click to on the backlight",
  "Gaming and video editing yes no problem, but if the video editing is like 4k video or very intensive stuff, I'd say upgrade the processor to the ryzen 7. The only concerns would be 8gb might not be enough for you and that a gtx 1650ti cannot run for example rdr2 at max settings at 60fps. But as for things like programming, and running virtual machines, no problem at all, unless you're running say 3 windows 10 virtual machines and all from the same HDD in which case the HDD will bottleneck really hard. I know because I just tried it yesterday, not a nice experience",
  "Uh idk I've never played sims before but I'd imagine it wont have any problems, the CPU crushes virtually everything else available, and the GPU can run pretty graphic intensive games well too",
  "Nope, when I enable caps lock only the small light in the corner lights up, I tried cycling through the backlight modes and indeed, the backlight stays off when I enable caps lock",
  "You definitely can connect an external monitor, that's what the HDMI port is for",
  "Brightness is not the best, only 250 nits. Color accuracy is 45% srgb so horrible for any content creation work but no problem for things like programming. In a well lit room I've found 50% to be okay for programming. But when it comes to like csgo, I push it to 60-70%. I have yet to use 100% brightness yet. As for the color accuracy I really cant tell you, I've never had any high quality screens before, always using budget laptops so honestly it just looks the same to me",
  "Unfortunately no",
  "Unfortunately I have no way to test this",
  "1. The laptop isnt too big for my backpack, but it is bigger than a regular 15.6 inch laptop because there is a area behind the hinges with a lot of IO ports. As for the weight it is rather heavy but there should be no problem putting it in your lap for say, a lecture.\n\n2. As for charge time I cant say, because I havent returned back to campus for lessons yet so ive been running on AC power all this time to reduce battery wear. It does support Lenovo Rapid Charge though, so it cant be slow. I can probably give you a rough estimate when I return to campus next week\n\n3. The only disadvantage I've faced is really only the weight of it. However that is the trade off for really good cooling. Like really good, I've never seen temps cross 80C even when I ran benchmarks. Other than that, probably having to readjust to this new keyboard layout. I've used 14 inch laptops my whole life so now having to ditch my, align hands to the both ends of the laptop when typing, to having to shift to the left as there is the number pad on the right. I find myself hitting the wrong keys alot during the first week of use",
  "It's installed on my SSD, I have a 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD config",
  "I got the 120hz, the 144hz was not available when I ordered it",
  "After 2 months, hinges are still perfectly okay, there are no scratches on my unit yet but there are scuff marks from the other things in my backpack rubbing against it, you could always buy a sleeve if you want to avoid this. As for battery life, I'd done a test before and posted it as replies, basically using chrome, mc word and discord video call, on 60% brightness, it lasted 2h 41mins",
  "Nope, I actually like the stickers and it's my way of flexing on my friends with their shitty intel 4 core CPUs",
  "Nope, no issues at all",
  "If you choose the rgb backlight add on, yes",
  "That's normal, mine does that too",
  "Always go for a PC over a laptop simply because a PC is upgradeable but a laptop is not. Only ever go for a laptop if you're in a situation where you need to travel and bring your work with you alot, example, student",
  "Yep, but out of my personal price range",
  "Sorry I don't play warzone, not enough space on my hard drive",
  "Yep definitely, I've run virtual machines on it and the fans were never at a noticeable volume",
  "I think I can safely say I'm the one of the first in my country to get it, I ordered it first day it went up on the lenovo website and when the website updated the shipping time from 4-6 weeks to 4 weeks, I emailed lenovo asking to clarify. The rep misunderstood me thought I was pissed off and apologized saying he'd expedite my order. Hence it ended up getting shipped just 6 days after ordering and it arrived after just 10 days on 3rd june",
  "Just that there arent many reviews out there yet, so I thought i could answer questions from any prospective buyers",
  "Yep, no issues so far apart from the wifi card not being detected at one point which was fixed with a BIOS update. \n\nNo hinge issues, build quality issues or even temp issues. I haven't cleaned it even once in these 2 years btw. Tho ofc the fan now runs noticeably louder due to that dust build up",
  "Dude these thermals are great. Holy shit.",
  "Yeah the thermals are great.",
  "You said to ask you questions",
  "U serious a 100% sRGB ? What about AdobeRGB?",
  "From the website they also show a better screen as one of the options \n \n15.6\" FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS, anti-glare, 250 nits, 120Hz, 45% CG\n\n15.6\" FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS, anti-glare, 300 nits, 60Hz, 100% sRGB\n\n **15.6\" FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS, anti-glare, 300 nits, 144Hz, 5ms response time, 100% sRGB**",
  "because you have the laptop lmao, the new legion line is a breath of fresh air from the previous one",
  "How do you think about the material of the deck? Is it durable for a long time?",
  "Thanks , I’ll check it out",
  "I already got my laptop.\nI was surprised how premium it feels given the price point. It’s an exceptional laptop for the money I guess, but I will still send it back.\n\nIt’s too heavy for my needs, even if it isn’t really heavy for a gaming laptop. I had to give it a try, and I’m honestly kind of sad as it’s a great device - just not MY device. Guess I’ll have to go back to real office laptops / Macbooks and have to refrain from additional gaming capabilities on the go.",
  "I play on an integrated graphics card, can’t even run roblox at minimum settings, i have been for years, I’m planning to get this next week, I already I’m gonna be happy with it 😂",
  "With shipping? What are your specs?",
  "Not true. For processes like gaming Intel 10rh gen still holds the throne as games are more on single core performance. Ryzen trumps Intel in multicore processes, but it does not outright beat Intel.",
  "I heard about that",
  "Can you please post a short video of you holding it, typing on it snd so we can get a feel. \nThe wait time to order get the 7i is more than 5 weeks here , I winder why ? Also I want it to last me 5 years. Also is it easy to open up the laptop and upgrade ram ? I read the ram is behind a thermal plate.",
  "Amd version has bigger battery 80wh option via double ssd config.",
  "Awesome, thank you again for the detailed feedback! This is really helpful information!",
  "Thanks for this thread.\n\nCould you elaborate on why gaming would reduce the lifespan of the machine ?",
  "Fair enough.but nobody said anything about pc master race.That in itself is an overpriced portable pc.I was talking about saving money",
  "Nice! Send the results please. Thanks!",
  "I'm surprised you don't need it at 100%. Glad to hear that :)",
  "Thx u for the info. I’m still waiting for my Legion T730 to arrive.",
  "The 5I is available but only with i5 processors",
  "I think so.",
  "Yeah I have that in the bios of my current laptop and it saves a decent amount of battery life compared to just using switchable graphics. Thanks for replying :D",
  "Thanks for your answer! LatencyMon is a application that checks if a system running Windows is suitable for processing real-time audio and other tasks. It can be downloaded for free. I attach you a link with the first side I found but there are multiple sources. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78S0CMafigM\n\nHere is a Video that explains how to use it (Just the first 3 minutes)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78S0CMafigM",
  "Wow it seems Lenovo got the thermals right unlike Dell & Asus. Please share some screenshots if you don't mind.\n\nNow I'm also excited for the Thinkpad E14. Hopefully they will not cripple the cooling system.",
  "I meant that but i have it in slovak so i translated it wrong",
  "Nice thanks for the 12am reply\n\nI'll stick with legion 5 with a ryzen 5 then (when i have more money)\n\nJust curious, whats the % / $ of student discounts (esp for urs)",
  "Damn",
  "Noted on this. Thanks for the response! :)",
  "Thanks for the reply! \n\nNow my options remain:- \nY540-60Hz-250nits-16gb -512gb SSD - i7(9th gen) - 1650 4gb \nAt around 1100 USD where I live (india) \n\nAnd the one you mentioned which might cost around more (+100) I guess..? \n\nI just do programming and run VMS so display is not a dealbreaker..\n\nWhat do you think I should do?\n\nAlso will I see a noticeable differences when running VMS between 9th & 10th gen?",
  "Can you add another SSD instead of the HD?",
  "sRGB 45%, but there are other screen options, a 60hz with 100%sRGB and a 144 hz with 100% sRGB",
  "Haha ok let me know. I have videos if you're curious how the 9th gen i7 (9750h) is in comparison. It throttles quite a lot :(  \n\nI have a cooling pad and I undervolt as well, still hits 95C sometimes. Fucking lenovo they couldn't figure out the new intel chips are a no go for laptops when they had the 8750H in there? nope took another 2 revisions with new intel chips to realize how retarded of an idea that was. fkn lenovo.   \n\n\ni shouldnt complain though, could be much worse. it took them close to a year to fix a software issue with the hotkeys.",
  "I honestly had never had experience with high end machines too, so you're saying I could get past the supposedly bad panel for gaming and watching movies? is it as dim as they say?",
  "Aight, thanks :)",
  "Is the RAM upgradable? Say for 16GB? Also the unit I'm buying has 512SSD, do you think that's enough for a college student? I'm not that informed when it comes to computer hardware sorry about that. I don't really play intensive games too but I think Overwatch is one that I play. I'm just concerned for programs like Adobe applications etc. and some games. We're on online classes too so I'm hoping if this is also a good laptop for work things yoo. Thank you!",
  "Sounds really good. Now i'm used to large 17.3\" laptops with numpad, so the keyboard probably won't be a problem for me. I think i'm gonna buy it. Thanks for the quick response!",
  "Fair enough :)",
  "Oh ok I don't need to bring it around. So I guess I will just go for a PC. Thanks, u/eatenlow",
  "I think you are also one of the first outside of China lol",
  "Hopefully mine will be be shipped as fast as yours, i ordered mine 2 days ago.  Was there an indication when they will ship the xbox one s that they are giving away with this purchase?",
  "Truly appreciate it, but my question was kinda pointing at the machine, why that. As I've been looking to replace my almost 5 year old hp laptop, I've been out of date with what's new and what's worth it given a vast price range. So I was asking why this one, what made you pull the trigger and what's different about it that caught your eye.",
  "Great to hear... I'm welling to buy legion 5 15ith6h",
  "Yeah! What's the ambient?",
  "An extremely underrated comment xD",
  "lol",
  "No idea man, the sRGB percentages were the specs given on the lenovo website while I was customizing the laptop specs, but the 100% sRGB option did require additional $10 top up though",
  "Well it wasnt available on my country's website so, lucky you I guess",
  "I mean it is just a laptop at the end of the day, plus I'm sure in a few months there will be new stuff which will put mine to shame, tech moves way too fast",
  "it really is... if you don't like RGB or playing games on the go...",
  "The surface is plastic, but the inner side with the keyboard, the surface of the plastic has this slight softer, rubber ish feel to it. Id say it makes typing abit more comfortable. But as for long lasting, it seems it will last a good few years, but not if you spill liquids on it",
  "No need to feel too down, take a look at the ideapad flex 5, with the ryzen 7 4700u, the vega 7 integrated gpu isn't really all that bad, it can run GTA V smoothly albeit not at max settings",
  "Shipping was given free by lenovo, my full specs are, ryzen 7 4800h, gtx 1650, 16gb 3200mhz ddr4 ram, 256 m.2 nvme ssd, 1tb 7200rpm hdd, screen is 250 nits, 1080p, 120hz",
  "Yeah, but in my opinion, for gain of just 10fps that too when you are above 60fps it is not value enough for me to leave 20% better CPU performance with AMD.",
  "https://youtu.be/9JgefLqzfsk\n\n\nThe above is a chinese review of the same laptop but with a ryzen 5 instead, only thing is that the laptop is sold under a different name in China, skip to around 10 minutes, it shows the reviewer opening up the laptop to reveal the ram",
  "Gaming isnt what will reduce the lifespan of the machine, rather its your gaming expectations which will. Because ultimately this laptop's maximum GPU at the moment, is a GTX 1650TI, a card which isnt even seen as a high end, or top of the line card by today's standards. As time goes on, games will only get more and more demanding to run as games are all pushing towards or even past 4k 60fps. So if you are someone who wants to play games on the highest graphics settings at all times, then in a pretty short time, you will find that the laptop is no longer powerful enough for your gaming needs. Hence shortening the lifespan",
  "It's just alot of people always tell me, laptops are a waste of money, and that desktops can give way better performance etc but as a student I just need the portability. As for it being overpriced, while true to a extent, I believe spending more now means I wont have to worry about my components becoming hopelessly outdated for quite a few years, especially when I've now got the ryzen 7 4800h. Basically I see it as spend more now so I have to upgrade even less frequently",
  "Right results are in, so from 100% at 60% brightness the laptop lasts 2 hours and 41 minutes. This is running YouTube, Microsoft word and discord at the same time, I even had my webcam turned on for an hour, so without that itll probably last just about 3 hours",
  "sure! :)",
  "Highest measured interrupt to process latency (µs):   387.20\n\nAverage measured interrupt to process latency (µs):   5.369768\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHighest measured interrupt to DPC latency (µs):       382.0\n\nAverage measured interrupt to DPC latency (µs):       1.832043\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsorry for late reply, i just got around to running the test",
  "I'm not sure about exact percent but for my order it was probably just below $200 off, I think around $180+ so probably around 10% off",
  "Personally, I feel that if you're not looking at getting the GTX 1660ti, the legion 5 is the way to go, the ryzen processor is just more powerful and consumes less power so your battery lasts longer too. As for intel 9th and 10th gen, benchmarks have shown that the difference is negligible, they basically are reselling you the same processor with a new sticker and name. Plus if you only want a 512gb ssd, you can get a free battery upgrade for the legion 5 to 80wh from 60wh\n\nI'm a IT student by the way, and I mostly run VMs and programming too, and so far, I've run 4 VMs at the same time, from kali linux to windows 10, and I can switch from one VM to another, with no lag at all, no slowdown noticed",
  "Yep, it has 2 m.2 ssd slots, if you dont want the hdd you then have the space to install 2 ssd instead",
  "RGB on keyboard i meant. did they get rid of that?",
  "Average CPU temps while playing gta online with max settings is 65C, but that's with the laptop propped up to improve air intake, so without that might be around 5C higher",
  "It's only bad for if you ever find yourself using it outdoors and it is sunny, because the screen isnt bright enough for that. But otherwise in a well lit room, 50-60% is all I need to see clearly",
  "Btw you can choose to add on if you want rgb back lighting for the keyboard, otherwise the default is just a plain white backlight",
  "The ram is upgradeable, it has 2 ram slots so you can just buy your own extra 8gb stick in the future if down the line you find 8gb to be too little. As for the storage, my opinion is that always have at least 1tb, so you got sufficient space for any games and that your storage will definitely last you a few years before you need to worry about cleaning up your files. But the legion 5 15 comes with 2 m.2 nvme slots, so once your 512 gb stick is full, you can buy another one, install it and boom more storage space. And if you're running things like photoshop and premiere pro, I'd recommend 16gb ram, especially now with online classes you probably have another video calling app open at the same time which will take up ram. As for if it's a good laptop for work? Absolutely, I'm using for my school work, no issues at all, only that it's on the heavier side. But id rather it be a little heavier than it catch on fire when I play games",
  "Fun fact, my laptop shipped out on 28th may and the sticker says manufactured date is 27th may, so you could say my laptop came super fresh",
  "I dont think I qualify because they only put up the banner on the website mentioning the free xbox was after I ordered mine so",
  "What got me was mainly the ryzen 7 4800h processor, I was actually intending to buy the Lenovo L340 gaming instead initially until this appeared on the lenovo store, the 8 cores the ryzen 7 4800h has allows me to do a lot of multi tasking work smoothly. Plus it comes with a gtx 1650 which would allow me to play the few games that interest me and also allow me to continue playing games quite a few years down the line even as games get more demanding, as I dont have high expectations or requirements for graphics. Finally was the price, in my country, this legion 5 15 cost the same as the L340 gaming when both are customized to equivalent specs, and the fact the ryzen 7 4800h has 8 cores vs the 6 cores in the i7 9750h, and can support faster ram, 3200mhz vs 2666mhz, and also sports the latest intel wifi 6 card which allows for maximum wifi speeds, something the L340 gaming didnt have. \n\n\nOf course this does beg the question of why didnt I look at say ASUS who also had laptops carrying the new ryzen 4000 series processors, that's because the ASUS TUF series firstly has cooling issues, and according to the asus rep in my country, isn't gonna be in stock for the foreseeable future. Plus other companies like Dell with the new xps laptops, sell at a very steep mark up in my country, therefore making it no longer value for money.\n\nSo in conclusion, I bought it because based on everything available I felt it gave me the best performance per dollar, and was within my budget",

  "I mean for the money yes 100%. Just that everybody seems to think Intel is getting it's ass handed to it. Indeed it is, but it's able to compete with AMD for a reason.",
  "Awesome \nThank you\nWhat are your thoughts on durability etc and using it for business. Do it look professional.",
  "Okay that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for explaining and also for taking the time for this thread. Definitely helps buying decisions.",

  "Nice! Pretty good considering the specs!",
  "Hey, no worries! Thank you so much for the efford! Unfortunately I am not to sure what to make out of the result. Did you leave it running for 10-15 minutes?

I leave you a link to the screenshots of the test he did:\n\nhttps://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21APyCACszmM3KlG8&cid=620A128F8C369EA2&id=620A128F8C369EA2%215333&parId=620A128F8C369EA2%21103&o=OneUp\n\nDid yours look anyhting like this? For the sake of comparation I also attach the link to a screenshot a user did on his Rog Zephyrus G14 (with proved to be good for audio rendering). \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/J042sd9\n\nYou can see that latency moon provides a text eather highlighted in red or green stating if the system is capable of handling real-time audio. Would you mind run another test and screenshot the results? Would be much appreciated. It is a critical bench for audio production and almost no reviews run it.",

  "Nah, my country's Lenovo store doesn't allow customizing, what you see is what you get. Which is slightly disappointing, but hey you get the new\n Ryzen 4000 series  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
  "Okay thanks I'm more confident in buying it. It really has a business vibe to it yet it can be for gaming too. I'll probably upgrade the RAM and the storage in the future. Thank you!",

I feel like we had the exact same process regarding choosing this over the L340. plus this one has 2 ram slots, where as the L340 and the newer Lenovo 3i series have only one ram slot (which is really stupid because those laptops are doing everything else right).\n\nI was able to get a Father’s Day deal and combined it with a student discount.

  "Problem is that I emailed asus asking about the A15 and the zephyrus G14, but the rep said that neither will be in stock in my country for the foreseeable future, plus in my country, computers in general are sold at marked up prices compared to in the usa so paying the price I did is actually considered a massive steal in my country",
  "What kind of modifications were you talking about?",
  "Yes, they are trying to compete ,that's why they are still better in single core performance.",
  "It feels sturdy and robust, but it is on the heavy side too. As for using it for business, definitely possible, it is much more subtle and quiet looking from the outside compared to the likes of asus where its flooded with flashing lights and RGB.

  "Personally I just dont like asus, because every time I go to a tech fair, asus always charges more than lenovo for similarly spec laptops, if you're interested in a slim laptop, you can take a look at the lenovo ideapad 5 AMD version, it sports the new AMD 4000 series processors, but a low power version so you get much better battery life, but it is capable of boosting its speed when under load so no need to worry about lack of performance, and it is relatively cheap, only thing is it doesnt have any dedicated GPU",
  "Which listing did you click on in the lenovo store, theres the regular legion 5 15 and a legion 5 15 build it yourself or sth like that, choose the regular one, for some reason the listing which is meant for complete customization gives me a higher price for my exact same configuration",
  "The legion 5 at the moment only has up to a GTX 1650ti, but Lenovo said that they will have up to RTX 2060 coming later in the year\n\nThe default is 60wh, you must make sure to choose that you do not want a HDD, the legion 5 has 2 drives, so choose your 512 gb SSD, then choose no hard drive for the second and the battery will automatically change to a 80wh battery\n\nDont let the pipes fool you, the thermals for the legion 5 is amazing, I've run jedi fallen order on it on epic settings, and the cpu never exceeded 80C and GPU never exceeded 68C, but that is with the laptop propped up off the table which does improve the airflow to the intake vents",
  "Generally yes, propping up the laptop will improve temps slightly. That's because most laptops' rubber feel simply dont lift the laptop high enough to allow good airflow through the intake vent at the bottom. So usually the restricted intake does have an effect on high temps",
  "Nice, how much was the total cost after the discount?\nI was actually about to just have the ryzen 5 4600h but after applying the student discount, suddenly now my budget could allow for the cpu upgrade so I went for it",
  "why you got it?",
  "Same. I bought from a reseller of Asus because the price from official here is so insane lmao. Hope you enjoy your new laptop!",
  "Hi, don't get the A15. Capacitor fried itself after a few days in service..I returned it and bought a Lenovo Y540.",
  "Fantastic !\nI want it to last me for at least 5 years without worrying about anything. \nAlso it takes more than 5 weeks to arrive - that's like an eternity in the computer business.",
  "Thanks.I had a friend who worked for Lenovo,they are pretty solid.And probably the cheapest",
  "only the build it yourself option shows up for me. talking to the service rep, he said they're only offering a 5% student discount on that product at this time. \n\ni ended up getting a sgd1709 config (after -90 for student) because they're also running a free xbox one s offer if you spend >1500 on legion? random ass offer but i figure i can recoup some cash by selling that thing.\n\nanyway thanks for the info, this thread helped me make my purchase decision!",
  "Thanks. \n\nI checked again unfortunately the only legion 5 that will be available in india is non upgradable with 60wh battery fixed I can add a HDD though. \n\nSo now it's the same almost just that it will be amd (which is great!) And y540 was Intel. \n\nAlso no option to upgrade screen as well so the same 60hz -250 nits display which should be good.",
  "Will something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/zvKmAiv.jpg) do the trick? I don't like to use cooling pads, I feel they are a rip off.",

  "Yeah the xbox is probably not happening, the thing has been going on since late may, and it said only first 60 orders",
  "Yep of course",

  "sorry my guy thats a different brand i dont own a asus grand laptop, but the legion pro not to expensive as the other brands and performance and thermals are great for longevity",
  "No coil whine and I don't believe this one has liquid metal, so no leakage issues there. Overall, it's been great. The build quality is pretty solid, but it's not as good as the MacBook or the Razer Blade I had. However, Razer got rid of the glass on their displays, which has led to them feeling lower quality to me, and lesser in comparison to the Macs that still use glass. The bottom panel is a cheap plastic one which again, feels lesser in quality vs those other two, but it's not something I notice in my regular usage because it's either docked or on a desk and then going in and out of a bag. \n\nIt has a minor issue on the trackpad, but it's still very usable, just annoying. Since I rarely use the trackpad and use external M&K when at home, or a mouse and the built-in keyboard while traveling, it's not a big deal. \n\nPerformance-wise, I'm still able to max out all of my games on absolutely Ultra settings including Path Tracing on Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2 with good frame rates on my external 34\" Ultrawide. When playing on the 2560x1600 internal display, performance is obviously even better. \n\nI bought this because I needed the absolute most power possible in the lightest, most portable package possible. I traveled for work weekly for the past few years, and I travel regularly, so having this has been a godsend. I remember playing Warzone in LaGuardia at one of the bars when my flight got delayed and blowing off steam was great. I took this to QuakeCon for 3 years now, and the ability to pack more power than my desktop into something that fits in my backpack is amazing.  \n\nComing from a Mac, probably your biggest hurdle is going to be battery life, but the latest CPUs are supposedly much better in that regard (though we hear that every generation so YMMV).",

It has literally no relevance to the question on why you want *two* laptops. \n\n>so i put my laptops in my backpack\n\nI'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume English isn't your first language and there's a language barrier here. ***Nobody*** is asking why traveling with a laptop is easier than a desktop.

  "Lenovo yoga pro 9i Aura Edition (Tandem Oled) They just released it, and it looks stunning with its Tandem OLED display, 1,600 nits peak brightness, Ultra 9 285H processor, RTX 5070, and up to 64GB of RAM. It’s like a dream Windows machine.\n\nHowever, why are they still not using anti-reflective coating on their laptops? It doesn’t seem like there will be a matte option for this one either. They claim it's designed for bright environments, but if you're working with a dark-themed interface, the glossy display turns into a mirror.\n\nApple offers a nano-texture option on the MacBook Pro, even though their standard glass already has an anti-reflective coating. Their mini-LED panel is also incredibly bright, yet they acknowledge glare as an issue—just like Lenovo, which provides matte displays on many of its laptops.\n\nSo why isn’t this laptop following the same standard?\n\n",

  "The new tandem model is now listed on the Australian Lenovo website. The \"basic model\" has a price tag of AU$3,999 ( Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 255H Processor and 2.8k 120Hz OLED). If you want the 3.2K Tandem OLED then it only comes wih the Intel® Core™ Ultra 9 285H Processor which is an AU$800 additional cost over the Ultra 7 255H.\n\nSo if you really want the tandem OLED display it is AU$5,400 which is an additional AU$1400 just to get the tandem display.\n\n[https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83L0CTO1WWAU1](https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83L0CTO1WWAU1)",
  "Regarding anti-reflective coating, both the touchscreen models of 2.8K and 3.2K OLED displays ARE anti-reflective. The other two non-touch models are not.\n\nIf you want a glossy screen on a laptop, it is always worth going for a touchscreen model because the anti-fingerprint layer also has built in anti-glossy + anti-scratch resistant feature.\n\nAlso, tandem OLED on Lenovo laptops is absolutely stunning in person.",
  "I could not agree more.  The Dell XPS, starting with 7590 (that I know of) has one of the best OLED anti-reflective treatment.  The recent HP Spectres use the Corning Gorilla DX, which is an anti-reflective variant.  The difference is night and day.  It helps the OLED display work much better and reduce the mirror effect.  \n\nIndeed, the Galaxy Book5 Pro has it too, but the specs are not up to par.  If in fact the Yoga Pro 9i with tandem/touch is like a mirror, that would be a real shame.  I do not know why manufacturers are not including anti-reflective glass.  I'd gladly pay more for it and do not buy computers that don't have it due to my use case.",

  "Did you check galaxy book",
  "On the contrary, they look much better when there is any sign of reflection.  They actually make the computer usable.  I've compared my many OLED laptops side-by-side.  Those with anti-reflective treatment, like the ones with Gorilla DX glass, simply look superior.",

The Yoga shows my face and every light source behind me.  Again, this is with tandem and touch.  From my view, there is no anti-reflective treatment whatsoever.  U.S. model.",
  "Per their specs, Lenovo uses the Dragontrail glass, which has an anti-reflective variant.  Corning Gorilla DX would have been another option.",

  "Asus ASUS ProArt P16 review. I think it's one of the best laptops in the market for creators. I've had the ProArt P16 review for almost 1 month now and I am impressed. It runs great, feels and runs like a premium device. I bought it for work and personal projects and I'm honestly happy with what I got. \n\nSpecs and Performance 10/10  - The P16 comes with an RTX4070 which is a solid graphics card. The CPU is AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 HX 370 which trumps and out performs the other top of the line CPU the intel ultra 9. The display is one of my favorite things about it, it's a 4K 16” 4K 60HZ OLED touchscreen. It can run anything and everything smoothly no matter what I'm doing. I can export high quality content faster then anything I've seen on my previous laptops. \n\nMUSETREE and ProArt Creator Hub 8/10 - Musetree has no subscription fees. Before I read that, i planned on ignoring the program. I have to say it's an amazing piece of software and I love that ASUS made it available. I've abandoned  programs like Riffusion and others in the same genre after trying out Musetree.\n\nI'm not a fan of the armory crate but thankfully Asus has the ProArt Creator hub to replace it and I think they did justice with it. While I don't recommend it for experienced veterans in the art and music industry. I do think it's good for beginners.\n\nLooks and graphics - The 4K OLED HDR display is beautiful and the image quality amazes me. I can work and focus on the tiniest details. Working with anything life like is another experience. The display really makes it worth it.  The speakers caught my attention. There are a total of 2 speakers, each built it to the sides of the keyboard. I was surprised at how good the sound is. Theres no distortion, no issues. It's feels almost perfect, like when and my friends go to the studio. \n\nBattery and cooling 9/10 - The P16 is at best warm. You can work all day without it getting hot. That being said, if you decide to game. It does get hot on the top side of the laptop. Above the keyboard and speakers. It is very noticeable to the touch. \n\nThe battery is pretty great for working, it will last you hours. If you decide to game... then it's just like any other gaming laptop when it comes to battery life.\n\n\n\nGaming and the display are fantastic on this laptop. I've never had a laptop that would boot up this fast, that would have 0 issues in every possible way when it came to working and gaming. Badly optimized programs and uncompressed videos are nothing when it comes to this laptop. and games run smooth, the experience is just on another level, and it is a future proofed laptop. Everything is so beautiful and on another level.\n\nThe P16 came with 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate that is NOT trial bound, so anyone can use it. \n\nTLDR - New owner of the ASUS ProArt P16  and had to share how amazing it and is and how much I have enjoyed it so far.\n\n\n\nThe model - ProArt P16 (H7606); Copilot+ PC - H7606WI",
  "it is *nearly* perfect. the glossy screen is not for creators. its for consumers. I contemplate returning it every day because of the super stupid reflections. It's unacceptable for creators. maddening because other than that it is spot-fucking-on Edit: one more thing, I liked the dial idea a generation back, this touchpad's halfway nonsense aint it.",
  "I'm really happy for you, lol kind of hate you for taking that pic like that though would love to see more of it.",
  "Damn, this looks sweet. Wonder if they have a 120Hz version",
  "I have mine for about a month now, loving how light it is when commuting. Programs run well but there’s a few little issues I came across. \n\nFirst week of using it I came across the blue screen of death but somehow it fixed itself.\n\nEvery time I unplug and run on battery the screen flickers on and off. \n\nThere’s been a few times the laptop turned off and took awhile to turn back on . Not sure what’s going on there.\n\nGames run well and the 60Hz does not bother me at all.",
  "Re: glossy screen, any matte screen guard won't work?",
  "I'm thinking about purchasing this laptop. I want to know if I connect this to an external monitor, and will it output at the monitors refresh rate? I'm aware the laptop is 60hz, but sure if connected to something like 144hz, the monitor will display in true 144hz?",
  "I’m considering get this to build applications with CUDA",
  "Hi, how is the screen wobble on it? If I have it on me whilst I lay down and type would it be noticeable and become annoying or is it sturdy?",
  "Did anyone find out how to change the color of the keyboard? I like white, not purple.",
  "How badly does this throttle if you're powered by a 140w usb-c block?",
  "Yes the laptop screen is 60hz by default but what do you guys think about using this laptop with an external monitor with a higher refresh rate? In my case, I have a Odysee G9 OLED, would this laptop be able to push the 240hz 1440p in gaming?",
  "you are lucky if your dial is responding. the control panel work fine but since i have the same laptop,i cannot use the dial. probably a hardware issue",
  "Does it have 120 hz on models other than 4k? ",
  "I bought one and think it's an utter defective piece of shit. \n\nBought one, not even 15 minutes later I get an undismissible pd firmware tool popup that won't go away on restart and won't do any firmware updates. \n\nExpensive unreliable garbage that doesn't work. Do not buy.",
  "Any idea on if and when there will be a newer model released? I am about to purchase one of these (I am about 90% convinced currently) But I could easily wait another 6 months before I pull the trigger and I would rather have the latest and greatest as you don't buy laptops very often.",
  "I agree. As a photographer a glossy screen is a no go.",
  "Hey have you considered using a matte screen protector? I'm thinking of buying this but I'm not too sure now.",
  "I'm in between buying this now and waiting for the new version in 6-12mos (a guess).  I purchased a Zenbook and the amount of chrome tabs or digital assets I am viewing seems to push it to it's limits sometimes and disrupt my workflow. \n\nCurious if you'd recommend waiting for the new version or buying this one now? I'm mostly viewing, editing, download photos/videos for marketing and social media mgmt.",
  "Haha yeah it really does not show how thin it is. When I'm back home I'll snap a better picture.",
  "I always wish they’d get a few shots of the laptop then of the side of the box with specs.. so I can really round it out without looking up model numbers.",
  "No. The PX13 and P16 both have professional 3K/4k OLED screens that are capable of 100%+ color accuracy in every category. They don't make panels like that over 60hz unfortunately. Apparently when you raise the refresh rate on these panels, you lose color accuracy. These laptops are for photo and video editing, modeling, and other \"creative\" purposes first. Gaming is not their primary purpose. The Zephyrus G14 and G16 line is made for that.",
  "[deleted]",
  "If you plugged the port thats directed to the dgpu, if flickers as the internal screen uses igpu, there would usually be another port not directed to the dgpu. (you can check this in nvidia control centre)",
  "Your blue screen fixed itself? \nI entered the BitLocker code, then it got stuck in boot loop. I read on another thread here about reverting back to bios 308, which I did, but it also ended up doing a full reset of windows so I lost everything on there. \nIt's working, but it wants me to keep updating to the newest bios which I believe will cause it to crash again. Kind of frustrated. Debating whether or not I should return it or cross my fingers that it won't have a bios air again",
  "Did you ever figure out the screen flicker? It's horrible on battery",
  "I FINALLY installed one from viascreens- the matte p16 one. It came with 2 screens, and a link to a details install video. Nice product and shipped securely. \n\nI took a photo right before I put it on, [and still can't believe they made it so reflective \\(cheaper\\)](https://i.imgur.com/U7CveQx.jpeg). It is really bad, as we've said countless times. but jesus it's like a freaking mirror. \n\nSo, I followed the directions to a T, it took 20-30 minutes and the 'matte' protector reduced reflections by only about 15% *maybe* 20% That sounds ok, but it is not nearly enough AND introduced an unreal amount of speckle ([here's a shot](https://i.imgur.com/yHehk3D.jpeg), I took the photo quickly since the camera couldn't focus too well with all the moiré). \n\nI could've lived with 1/2 the speckle and 2x as much glare reduction. But as it is? I took it off after 15 minutes. Too many tradeoffs. \n\nHope this helps!",
  "Same question here",
  "Yup it can support that",
  "I have ordered it, ASUS P16 -ryzen 7AI HX , 32GB RAM, 1TB , RTX 4060 . For $1586 , at best buy for this deal of $500.\n\nIm little worried about seeing the reviews of battery, bios, display, refresh rate, build quality and soo many.\nWhats your opinion if you have used it.?",
  "No wobble at all",
  "its single color",
  "It basically functions as if it's on battery if you're not using the 200w charger.",
  "I have one sitting right in front of me, but I've been delayed in putting it on. I'll report back if/when I do! ",
  "Such a tough question. Truley a love/hate situation. I might sell this for a new one as well, but I fear they won't add any kind of appropriate MATTE display, which would be the only reason for me to do that. So, I don't think they will address the shortcomings unfortunately. And it is frustrating! Because the laptop is EXACTLY 87.3% PERFECT. The parts that are imperfect are so bad I want to throw it out the window. \n\n**As a Creator laptop:**\n\n**The Good:**\n\n- build quality \n\n- amount, type, and location of ports are perfect. should be standard.\n\n- 4k+ resolution, another thing that should be standard\n\n- battery life (once bloatware and g-helper are sorted)\n\n- led placement and purpose, surprisingly. \n\n- All the hardware is well thought out (yes I'm saying this twice, don't change it!)\n\n\n**The Bad:**\n\n- the touch version of the Aus Dial is beyond useless, it needs to be physical like the original. \n\n- The asus software is silly and bloated. they have around 9 apps and services that can be replaced by g-helper, thankfully.\n\n- The finish (I think there is only black?) is not only a fingerprint and dust magnet, it should be used in police forensics to collect dna. I have to wipe down before and after each use, sometimes with isopropyl. I have never had a laptop this bad (and I've owned a lot)\n\n**The Horrific (should be in prison for implementing):**\n\n\n- the glossy screen. It's a mirror. It WILL give you headaches. It is so bad matte screen protectors do nothing to dim the reflections.\n\n\n- The Soldered, unchangeable RAM. This is a pure cash grab by the industry (thanks apple c!nts), and for creators, it is cutting us off at the knees. \n\n\n- The MAX ram, the highest end unit is capped at 64gb.\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nAs a Gamer Laptop\n\n- Don't buy. look at razer and g14/16.\n\nEdit: My use case is 3d modeling/animation/photography/video editing/gaming/game design... Basically anything with graphics and images for professional production.",
  "Yeah I’m a game developer so I would ideally have both :P",
  "The strange thing here is that the \" ProArt Studiobook Pro 16 OLED (W7604)\" does have a screen with 100%, and also with 120hz. But of course the screen is not 4k, it is 3.2k. In my opinion it would be better to place it for the next version, hopefully by 2025, a 4K 120hz OLED screen would be ideal.",
  "Yeah, 1440p even with 120Hz would be perfect!",
  "update bios to 3.12 that fixes the automatic loop no need to wipe and redownload",
  "I feel like it’s just the screen changing over from plugged in to battery as I have it set that I run it on performance when plugged in and quiet mode on battery, which changes the GPU and CPU usage.",

  "Actually - being on usb-c power functions _worse_ than if you are on battery.  The usb c charging, imo, is for emergencies only.  I've got another post on it around these parts.\n\nBut there was some firmware update on the usb c power delivery just last night, so maybe maybe maybe they have fixed it. Haven't tested it, though.\n\n\nUPDATE: A USB-C Firmware Update to the ProArt P16 ~1/22/2025, appears to have fixed the USB-C poor performance vs. just being on battery.  USB-C is still worse than the original power supply, but it appears equal to the battery now.",
  "hey! curious how that matte screen protector went! any chance you have it a shot?",
  "Hey digging up and older thread here. Did you wind up putting on the matte protector? Any other issues you’ve had with the Pro Art since then? I’ve got another 7 weeks to decide if I’m keeping this thing or not. Other than a shit ton of updates I’ve had to do, along with some screen flickering before it tells me it needs to update, it’s seemed pretty good. I agree the glossy screen is kind of annoying tho in a bright room.",
  "Thank you for the all the info!  This is very helpful - I was hoping the asus dial was more functional as the hardware piece looked clunky, but that's a shame this version doesn't work out. Also a huge bummer on the screen reflection...\n\nI'm torn...currently on a video call and trying to do passive work in the meantime and my machine is slower than I'd prefer (deleting text and typing text is now slower than normal)- and it's nothing monumental, just a bunch of sheets and images opened for post scheduling. \n\nI've been Pixel and Windows since the beginning and am really trying to not have to make the switch to apple, but after getting the 8a (feel like I stepped back in time with this) and seeing any Windows laptop close to the Macbook Pro and the issues associated with them, I'm as close as I've ever been to switching.",

Even when I'm using something that relies on the dgpu when plugged in like Davinci, the flicker still happens. Used to be a few times a minute and now it's once every 5 minutes.

  "Lenovo Yoga 7i Gen10, 14-inch laptop (2025) review **UK-based Laptop Review**\n\n**1. Title:**  \nLenovo Yoga 7i Gen 10 (2025) Review: power and portability\n\n**2. Introduction:**\n\nThis is a review for the 2025 yoga 7i gen 10 model from Lenovo with intel core ultra 7 258v and 14 inch screen. I bought the configuration from the UK Lenovo website with 32GB RAM, 1TB SDD, 2.8k OLED 120Hz screen, Luna Grey colour and optioned the fingerprint scanner for an additional £10, paying £1090 in total (including the 10% VIP discount for healthcare workers). This is a premium grade 2-in-1 consumer laptop with a solid build, great for anyone who needs a portable and powerful device.\n\nI haven’t seen many user reviews for this particular generation of laptop so thought it would be useful for anyone considering it.\n\n**3. Design and Build Quality:**\n\nThe chassis all metal, which gives it a very solid feel. The build quality is great, there’s very little flex in the case or the keyboard. The body does not pick up fingerprints. At 1.4kg, it’s not the lightest laptop but it’s still very portable. It fits my 13 inch laptop sleeve. I don’t have much use for the tablet mode as I find it too cumbersome when compared with holding an actual tablet. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and the trackpad is smooth and accurate. I appreciate the double height enter key. Coming from the LG gram 16, this is a much better typing and trackpad experience.\n\nPort selection is good. There are 2 USB-C ports, one on either side, with one USB-A, one full-sized HDMI, a microSD card slot and a headphone jack. The power key is on the right side which I’ve mis-pressed a couple of times so I’ve disabled it in the settings.\n\nThe display is a 14-inch glossy OLED touchscreen with 2.8K resolution (2880 x 1800), 500 nits brightness (1100 nits HDR Peak). I find the screen bright and vibrant. Watching video in a dimmed room is fantastic with zero light bleed. Reflections and fingerprints can be an issue, especially when viewing dark things on the screen and there is bright ambient. However it is still useable under these conditions.\n\nThe hinges are solid, with little screen wobble when typing but it does require two hands to open the lid. The look and feel of the laptop is very nice with smooth rounded outer edges.\n\n**4. Performance and heat:**\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 258v is perfectly capable of handling my usual tasks of multiple Chrome/ Firefox tabs, connecting to my remote desktop for work and steaming video content.  I have tried some gaming and the experience with casual  games has been very good. Fortnite runs at 120FPS. Cities Skylines runs great. I’ve tried playing Watchdogs and although it could play it, the framerates were only around 40fps and the processor got quite hot with the fans getting noisy.\n\nThe keyboard and palm rest areas are always cool. The area under the screen gets warm under load but the hot air is blown out through the vents on the back, away from the user which is a good design.\n\n**5. Audio and Webcam:**\n\nThe speakers are fine, they are up firing from the sides of the keyboard and they are rated for Dolby Atmos. I can clearly hear the 3D effects when watching YouTube or Netflix. There isn't much bass but it is acceptable for a thin and light laptop.\n\nThe 5M IR camera is decent for video conferencing. There is a privacy shutter switch just above the camera. Windows Hello usually takes just a few seconds to log me in. I have found the fingerprint scanner works faster, especially when the lighting conditions are not ideal for Windows Hello.\n\n**6. Battery Life:**\n\nThe 70WHr battery lasts all day for me when web browsing/ streaming videos. I use a 100W Ugreen 4-port USB C charger to charge all my devices and the laptop fully charges within a couple of hours.  \n\n**7. Software and User Experience:**\n\nThe OS is Windows 11 Home 64 and comes with some minor bloatware including McAffee Antivirus, Lenovo support/ vantage/ AI shenanigans. The Lenovo Vantage software has some useful features including dimming various parts of the screen to save battery – I only use the taskbar dimming though as I find the background dimming too distracting. It also enables you to switch the laptop on just by lifting the lid, which means the much maligned side power switch is hardly ever used. There have been reports of this power button breaking easily on other models and thus bricking the device.\n\n**8. Price and Value:**\n\nThe base model costs £1000 (£900 for students or those that qualify for VIP member) and comes with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and a14inch WUXGA OLED screen (1920x1200, 400nits, 60Hz). I was happy to pay the \\~£200 premium for the better spec’d screen with double the RAM and SSD. Mine came with a 65W USB-C charger and a stylus pen which magnetically attaches to the lid.\n\n**9. Pros and Cons:**\n\n* **Pros:** Screen, performance, battery life, keyboard\n* **Cons:** Screen reflections, power key positioning.\n\n**10. Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a well-built laptop where the pros far out-weigh the cons. The OLED screen is fantastic and it has been a pleasure watching content in a darkened room. It is very easy to travel with, having all-day battery life and a thin and light form factor.\n\n**Final Rating:** 9/10",
  "Really nice post.\n\nIm looking into this as pretty much the only option as the price is really good compared to others.\n\nIm sceptical about the hinges, but you say they are fine. And also if the performance is okay, if i could spec it id go higher but there arent really any options. \n\nThe next thing is vivobook which goes about 50% more with worse screen",
  "How about the weight, does it feel heavy...do you think it's worth the penny and do you think it's a good investment until 2028 atleast?",
  "Im setting up my 16 inch model right now and the fans are running on low constantly and high pitch too, did yours do the same?",
  "Hey, I am curious how did you opt for the fingerprint scanner. I can't find it in the configurations. Thanks.",
  "Potentially stupid question...\n\nI'm comparing different Lenovo Yoga 7s on their website,  and nowhere does it say which generation is which... How do you guys know this information?\n\nThere's so many reviews out there 😵‍💫",
  "I'm thinking of getting this laptop but I'm wondering about the CPU performance for things like python and matlab number crunching(data/optimization/small simulations etc)\n\nJust curious what kind of work do you do on it and is the CPU fast enough for that? I'm still not sure whether the lesser multicore compared to a 200H arrow lake is a problem or if I'm overthinking about the 258V",
  "hello, here some questions:\n1. what version of hdmi port does it have?\n2. What components could you upgrade? ssd, battery, keyboard?",
  "Just a question: does the screen have a plastic border, or is it all glass? ",
  "[removed]",
  "Hi OP, I read a few other reddit posts regarding poor battery life on this particular screen option (2.8K) compared to alot of the youtube reviews (which seems to be based on the 1200 screen option). When you say all day do you mean \\~7 hours? Are you leaving your screen on 120Hz or reducing it to 60Hz.",
  "Hi, I’ve used a Lenovo Yoga 7 AMD from a few generations back with the Ryzen 6800U for the past 3 years and have had no issues with the hinges for what it’s worth!",
  "Thanks. Only time will tell regarding the hinges but they look and feel sturdy to me and these double hinge designs should in theory spread the force out across the 4 contact points on each hinge, reducing the stress at any one point. I'll update if I have any problems with the hinges",
  "It doesn't feel heavy but it's not feather-light like the LG gram. The LG gram can be lifted from a corner with one hand easily whereas I'd struggle to do this with the Yoga 7i. The Yoga 7i   feels more substantial, more premium. However it is still easy to carry around in a back pack.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase so far - it does everything I need and I feel it is good value for what you get compared to an equivalent from HP or Apple. As long as I keep the battery in good condition and the hinges don't break, I'm sure it'll last a good 3-5 years. \n\nIf I didn't play PC games, I would have strongly considered a macbook air 13\".",
  "The 14 inch model doesn't have this problem at all. It's mostly silent. Your 16 inch model should have even better thermal handling given the extra space. The constant fans might be due to all the updates being installed, see how it goes",

The UK lenovo website states which gen it is,  the i is for Intel, they usually have AMD in brackets for AMD models. X means snapdragon. I think the gen 10s are sometimes called Aura Edition too",
  "1. The HDMI port is a standard sized 1.4b\n\n2. The SSD can be upgraded via the M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe SSD slot but that's about it. The RAM is soldered on the model I got.",
  "There is a black border around the screen but the glass extends over it. The border houses the web cam",
  "I turned off the side power button and activated the open screen to switch on option which works really well. It means I never accidentally mis-press the power button and it should last a lot longer",
  " battery life has been fine for me, I've kept it at 120Hz and only charge up to 80%. Off power, I've been using it for 5 hours now, browsing/ streaming at 50% screen brightness and there's still 45% remaining, so that's just 35% battery use after 5 hours of light usage. I would expect at least 12 hours from a fully charged battery",
  "So pc games work on this one? How is the performance, which games did you try out and does it heat up?",
  "Do you still see that option? Cause I don't see it when I want to configure it",
  "Interesting... Yea the Canadian site doesn't mention generation. We have all those versions though.",
  "yea the cpu and size are all included in the full model name, but aura edition stands for the optimized intel partnerships versions that have slightly better battery life and perfs",
  "Is it possible to replace the keyboard?",
  "Awesome. Thank you ",
  "[removed]",
  "Whats the thought behind charging to 80% - does this extend overall battery life long-term?",
  "Yes, you can play PC games. Fortnite runs at 100-120FPS on the native screen resolution. Cities Skylines plays well.  I wouldn't expect to be able to run the latest AAA 3D intensive games well, but it can run most of them on low settings but I wouldn't recommend it for that as the fan noise gets quite loud if pushed too hard.",
  "Yes, it's still there as an option on the Lenovo UK website for the Lenovo Yoga 7i",
  "You would have to replace the entire assembly including touchpad",
  "I've used the laptop for a few months now and on the rare occasion that I do need to use the side power button (maybe twice so far), it's worked as it should. I think if the usage of the power button is so low, it should easily last the entire life of the laptop",
  "Yes, it's an option in the power management software to prolong battery health. It's standard practice for all lithium batteries"
