  "Need help buying a laptop (India) I've checked many specs and wanted to go with Ryzen(ntg more specific ) not gonna be gaming but need the laptop to last a few years at least. Decided on this laptop. Give suggestions please ,abt this laptop and any other good one's.",
  "Never seen a Laptop with 24Gb Ram. Lmfao. \nNevertheless is a good comp.\nBut it dont have a graficcard",
  "Considering your at a budget where you can only get a new consumer grade laptop, Lenovo Ideapad is a budget laptop same as Acer Aspire 3, you get what you pay for so if you pay for budget price, you get budget quality, but I can't really pinpoint how long that laptop will last because it's either you're unlucky that it will last for only two years or lucky enough for it to last for 4 to 5 years",
  "budget? in rupees",
  "Check on lenovo.com maybe after offer and discount you get it cheaper there dm me for help",
  "Which laptop did you buy? I have the same budget and use as you. I landed on the same laptop, but the one that comes with the Snapdragon X chip. As I am looking for a long battery backup and a Lenovo or Asus Brand. I am getting the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Snapdragon variant at 40K. All the office applications I use are already compatible with the Snapdragon processor, so that is not an issue. Should I go with this option and is there any other laptop that I should consider?",
  "Ikr the ram and Thank you. I won't specifically need a graphic card so it's okay",
  "Oh okay. Hope I'm lucky , also Do u have any other laptop suggestions ? without considering the budget",
  "Around 60 to 65,000",
  "Will check it out, thank you",
  "I Bought this one , I checked out many options and found this the best considering the price and specs, idk much abt snapdragon so can't compare, but this is good for now and other than this the lenovo yoga , asus vivobook is good but higher price.",
  "Here you go,here is a detailed review of this laptop,tech power up reviewed the 16gb ram variant in this review.\n\nhttps://www.techpowerup.com/review/lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-15ahp10/",
  "Probably the lenovo thinkpad or a framework laptop",
  "Yes get from site you'll get sheer ID disc other coupons and 3yr ADP and premium at very low cost",
  "I think apart from Snapdragon processor both laptop are same. Yes, i also believe it is the best value for money as compre to other laptop in that price range. How's the build and overall laptop? Any issues?",
  "Oh wow, thanks",
  "Will check it out, thank you",
  "Also I am getting the snapdragon laptop for 35k. Do you think apart from processor it is a good laptop and would you recommend. ",
  "Nope, it's been more than a week and no issues till now , build is fine and battery is good",
  "Yeaa",
  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

  "Getting a new laptop through my work at a discounted price, looking for stylus note taking, modelling, gaming and office use. Help me choose \nI'm able to get one of these laptops through my workplace for a somewhat discounted price with a 3 year warranty. My main use case is going to be writing some notes on the device as a tablet with a stylus, lightish gaming, CAD and video editing. Then some general office and Uni work. So Clair Obscur is a game I want to play, some light modelling in blender maybe or autocad, and editing 1080p footage and possibly short 4k video in Da vinci. Any thoughts?

  "How is lenovo Ideapad slim 5 Ryzen 7 7735HS. If anyone have this laptop i really wanna know the reviews. Nd battery too.",
  "FIrst and foremost doubt. Why is the title and description says 7735HS and the options below says 7735U?\n\nBoth of them are good performers. If we go to specifics, both have same cores and threads, 95% details are same between those twooo.\n\nThe only difference is:\n\n* **7735HS** is 15% better in multi-core performance than 7735U. HS is 15% better in performance than U.\n* **7735U** has better performance per watt, meaning slightly higher battery power than 7735HS. U has better efficency than HS (maybe like 10mins more depending on the usage).\n\nMake sure you are getting the model that you are looking for. The seller might have done the incorrect information, but just to make sure you are getting the same contact with them and confirm once. Just a precautionary.\n\n**Disclaimer:** These are rough calculations.",

It has a 60Wh battery. Or IdeaPad slim 5 gen 10 with ai 7 350.

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",

  "NEVER buy asus laptops they are masters in pc motherboards but recently asus is horrible in laptops and their drivers and everything. for you or generally speaking Lenovo should always be your first option because it is with no doubt the best preformance per value in the market or you could also get a HP which are great but i favor Lenovo. and the ideapad slim 5 is THE BEST option, it has the best build quality and also does not break the bank.",

  "First one, the amd two in one is def a good deal especially if you like the two in one feature.",
  "First fosho, that’s a great price and I *love* having a 2 in 1. If you are a student, see if you can get a discount to bring that down even more and that will be a godly deal",
  "In this case choose AMD Ryzen 8000 Series over Intel Meteor Lake U Series. Similar battery efficiency but the AMD has better integrated graphics.",
  "First one, no contest",

  "1",
  "Pure garbage. Don't buy this thing, many reported hinge problems including mine. Few months after the 2-year warranty expired, my left plastic hinge cover cracked and crushes the display glass. Thankfully the LCD still works fine, touchscreen is dead 1/3 of the display. \n\nTried to complaint to Lenovo service center and whaddya know, 2 people also had the same problem (they still got their warranty). Unfortunately they couldn't do anything.\n\nThe screen is also dim and muted in colors. The addition of touchscreen is nice, but not as nice when it broke. Do yourself a favor and get a Thinkpad or Ideapad 5 Pro if you're going Lenovo as they are much more robust.",
  "I have the second one, the Slim 5i and I would not recommend it for $700 in 2025 for three reasons.\n\nIt is slim but takes up a lot of surface area with the taller 16:10 screen ratio. Not something you want to carry around. \n\nThe big screen would be great but it isn't color accurate or bright. Has a 45% NTSC rating where everything including YouTube feels washed out with a layer of white colors. Basically the same screen they were using in 2021, and likely just threw it on here because they have a lot of old stock.\n\nThe internals feels underpowered and lacks quality. Trackpad makes a flimsy clicky noise, keyboard isn't as polished with key travel, speakers sound tinny with no bass, webcam feels like a phone camera from 2015, it doesn't have 40 GBps thunderbolt 4 instead just basic 5GBps USB c ports. The Core 7 is a rebranded 2023 processor, not to be confused with the new Core ULTRA 7 processor from 2024.\n\nIf you haven't already you can go to a Costco and see these on display and play around with them. I doubt this lasts anywhere near 10 years like your old laptop, maybe just 3.",
  "duly seconded. the processor is a beast, the laptop itself is a good size, and it's too good of a value",

  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",
  "Which should I buy?! I saw these were the best options for under $1500! \nI just graduated basic training for the Air Force now I am in tech school for 11 months. I want to use the laptop for school and for gaming. I also want it to last me for at least 4+ years while I take college classes. If you have any different recommendations let me know!

  "Asus Zenbook UX533FN-RH54. The best laptop for the money. My review. https://www.amazon.ca/ZenBook-UX533FN-RH54-Ultra-Slim-i5-8265U-Processor/dp/B07NDM56S8/ref=sr_1_1?crid=38JKR05RB82UO&keywords=ux533fn-rh54&qid=1561259495&s=gateway&sprefix=UX533%2Caps%2C220&sr=8-1\n\nI would like to start this review off by talking about some of the laptops I have owned in the past.\nLenovo Y560 15.6, Asus Zenbook UX32VD, Sony Vaio Duo 13, Apple Macbook pro 13 (2015) and the Microsoft surface pro 4. By far my favorite laptop out of these was the Zenbook. It was a 13 inch ultrabook with dedicated graphics, a gorgeous 1080p bright display and I had upgrade the HDD to SSD and added more memory to 8gb. I really enjoyed that laptop but had to let it go because of its poor battery life. So when my Surface pro 4's hinge broke up for no apparent reason and i went through two chargers and the keyboard kept disconnecting I thought to myself its time to go back to Asus. \n\nEnter the UX533FN.\n\nPrior to buying this laptop I had a lot of reservations. Mostly because of the touchpad issue people appear to be reporting and size and weight.\nSo here's my review after a week of testing:\n\n**Chassis 8.7/10:**\n\nWhen I held this laptop in my hand for the first time and felt its cold chassis and its finger print magnet lid, I knew I was holding a Zenbook. This is a solid laptop for its size and this price point. I cannot feel any keyboard flex for example when pressing hard down at the centre of the keyboard. This is not a unibody laptop however, and just liek my old 13 inch UX32VD, when you hold the laptop with one hand you definitely feel the bottom plate flexing slightly. Measuring at around 18mm, This is pretty thin for 15 inch but its no macbook air. Most of the thickness is actually thanks to the glass screen. The display's frame is pretty thick but I really like it. There's no flex to this display whatsoever and I feel like this is the compromise they needed to include the narrow 3mm bezels. The color of this laptop is dark blue. I would have much preferred the silver version but its hard to find in Canada. The keys are not blue however, nor are they black. They are actually very subtly purple. The rear lid can take on a blue color or a purple color depending on how light hits it. Overall this is a very good looking laptop. Despite being 15.6 inches, It is also only slightly a bit bigger than my old 13 inch UX32VD and weighs slightly more. This is likely the most portable 15.6 inch laptop in the market today. It is nearly a pound lighter than all other 15.6 inch competitors except for the LG gram IIRC.\n\n**I/O 9.5/10:**\n\nHonestly this is fantastic. One USB A 3.0 and one USB A 3.1 port, one USB C port and a FULL SIZED SD card reader for my photography work as well as a full sized HDMI. I could ask for thunderbolt 3 but personally I have little use for it as I don't intend on hooking this laptop up to any expensive monitors or gaming with it with a external GPU. I do wish I could charge with a USB C port rather than a old barrel style charger. However living with a Macbook Pro and Surface pro 4, I've learned that because the barrel charger can rotate freely in the port and USB/C, Surface charger and Whatever apple comes with cannot, the cord will probably last longer. \n\n**Trackpad 9.8/10:**\n\nI've heard horror stories but I cannot fathom why. Maybe I got lucky or maybe Its because I updated all possible drivers right as when I got the laptop but the trackpad has been completely flawless in the one week i've owned this laptop. As good as my Surface Pro 4 and better than my old Zenbook's. I will dock one point for the trackpad feeling a bit too sensitive? I feel like I don't need to tap that hard for it to register a click. Overall this trackpad is excellent, I have no real complaints.\n\n**Keyboard 8.4/10:**\n\nTo give you some prespective on this keyboard's performance, my typing speed is faster on this than on a Logitech G910 mechanical keyboard. This keyboard is fantastic. Plenty of travel, perfectly tactile, and the keys feel consistent. But throughout my rigirious testing of this keyboard it appears to have the same issue I had with my Vaio. If I hold down shift, and press E and space quickly right after, sometimes it misses the space. For example I am typing THIS IS THE BEST LAPTOP EVER. It will probably type it out as THIS IS THEBEST LAPTOP EVER. It will miss the space. I only do this if I am yelling at someone online so this isn't a huge deal to me. If i wasn't looking for this I probably would not have discovered it. On the VAIO though, this was a deal breaker as writing ING really fast would miss the G. So The Kin of scotland was....Havin more than one apple, etc ING is very common. Apart from this, I do wish this did not have a numpad and the keyboard was more central. it took a day to get used to this. The keyboard's lighting appears pretty even throughout although plenty of light leaks out which to me...is actually asthetically pleasing. The key caps when lit up, have yellow tinged lettering to go along with the bronze decorative elements of the chassis.\n\n**Battery life 9.5/10:**\n\nI am seeing 10 hours of web browsing time on a comfortable screen brightness level for indoors (around 20-30%) and 12-14 hours of typing a document. Note turning on the keyboard lights affects the battery life almost as badly as turning the screen brightness all the way up. \n\n**Performance, thermals, noise 9/10:**\n\nFor the money, for being an ultrabook, this has excellent performance. The SSD is fast, the laptop boots in less than 5 seconds. Its good for some light gaming. I was able to run Shadow Tactics: Blades of Shogun at the highest settings at 50 fps and thats as far as im willing to push this thing. Fans became audible and CPU temperatures got to about 80C (90C with Prime 95 torture test) but the keyboard and palm rest area never got hot and the underside only got slightly warm. There was no thermal throttling under my testing and I have not modified the voltage of the cpu either. The Macbook, old Zenbook and Surface pro 4 all had far far worse noise and thermals. The Surface Pro 4 got hot just browsing the web. Unless Im pushing this thing with Prime95, or gaming I cannot hear the fans. Ever. Not even when working in Adobe Lightroom. The Macbook and the Surface Pro 4's fans would be blasting at this point. There is no coil whine on my unit.\n\nWifi and blutooth both maintain a strong connection, no complaints here. Keep in mind Intel has a driver update for the wifi that Asus does not and it nearly doubled my Wifi Performance.\n\n**Display 9/10:**\n\nThis display has some of the best in class contrast ratios so photos are gorgeous on this thing. Colors definitely pop and blacks are very black. The narrow bezels also make a huge difference and I am definitely adding points because of this feature. It could be a bit brighter but at its brightest settings it is uncomfortably bright for me to use indoors so I think it is bright enough. Colors seem pretty accurate and it has about 90% sRGB coverage. For the price of this laptop, it is an excellent display with fantastic viewing angles. Windows hello is so much better and faster on this laptop than it was on my old Surface Pro 4. Even in complete darkness it recognizes me, even when Im further away it recognizes me and instantly. The two red glowing dots are also pretty sick. There is slight lightbleeding at the edges given it is a IPS panel but nowhere near as bad as my old Zenbook or the Surface Pro 4. This is not a touchscreen display, which for me, even if it was, I would not use or touch it. \n\n**Overall:** \n\nThis is not something I can say for the other laptops I've tested. Other than the keyboard bug, this laptop has provided me with the most headache free usage in the first week than any other laptop I have owned. You cannot beat this for the price for a portable, beautiful, premium productivity and multimedia machine. I was ready to return this thing before I opened the box. I was so prepared that at the first sign of trackpad problems or other issues I would return it but so far apart from the keyboard bug that I would never really encounter in real world use, there's been nothing. Keep in mind though there are better options out there for gaming laptops at this price point.\n\n\n**[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/5smjwD1)**\n\n\nI had also considered buying the Huawei Mate X Pro i5. Here's what it came down to:\n\nHuawei Mate X Pro Pros vs Zenbook:\n\n- Gorgeous high resolution display with 99% sRGB coverage and favorable 3:2 aspect ratio and over 400 nits of brightness (vs ~300 nits for the Asus)\n\n- Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C charging, External GPU support ( 2019 edition only, its not out yet)\n- Lighter and more portable\n- Fingerprint reader\n- Touchscreen (not relevant to me, I still have the Surface Pro 4 for touchscreen productivity)\n\nHuawei Mate X Pro Cons vs Zenbook:\n\n- No full sized HDMI port\n- No full Sized SD Card reader (huge for my photo editing work)\n- No Nvidia MX150\n- 256gb SSD vs 512gb SSD\n- Questionable Huawei support and future in North America\n- Nearly 400 dollars more expensive\n- No USB-A 3.1 port\n- Worse battery life (Notebookcheck)\n- Worse thermals (Notebook check)\n- Slower SSD (Notebookcheck)",
  "How about a section about maintenance and upgrade potential in the future?\n\nDoes it have 2 M.2 slots or dual RAM slots, is there anything soldered ? Room for an 2.5\" mechanical HD or SSD?",
  "what I don't like about this laptop is that HDMI and type c ports are on the right side. So when I'm connected to the monitor the cable would get in the way of my mouse",
  "Great review, thanks.\n\nI'm planning on getting  **UX533FD** and Amazon us reviews are REALLY bad for it.\n\nI got a bit calmer after reading Amazon uk reviews and now yours as well.\n\nWill try to remember to update this post after getting my unit (in about a month from now).",
  "Did you consider the Dell XPS 15 9570?",
  "Any idea if this Variant is available on Amazon USA",
  "Generally laptops in this category have a m.2 SSD for future upgradability. The RAM is soldered on however. There is a 16gb RAM version with a 1050Ti MaxQ and a i7 for around 2000 CAD. This is something that you can google, my review is more of my personal  daily experience with the machine.",
  "who needs 2.5\" drives anyways? just get a cheap sata m.2 ssd. hdd sucks and just don't buy them",
  "Asus laptops seem to be a hit or miss for a lot of ppl. I've got an older zenbook ux305 13 inch and I've had a few issues but overall it's lasted me 4+ years for normal academic usage. Planning on getting ux333 or the 2019 model so hopefully that'll be great too with mx150 gpu.",
  "I don't like Dell as a brand and it costs much more.",
  "When you need much more storage then m.2 can support you can’t beat mechanical hard drives for the GB/price ratio. Especially for secondary storage."
