  "My mac just died I need help to choose a new laptop. It's a laptop for personal use. I will use it mainly for web browsing and gaming (no triple-a games, mostly old ones). Note that my mac was not able to run half life 1... I know nothing in this regard, but I want something reliable and tough. I'm looking for one of those 2 models. Which one would you suggest me and feel free to recommend other model as well (specs close to : intel i5 or AMD, 16gb ram, 512gb memory and a dgpu). Budget around 1-1.5k.\n\nhttps://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-pro-series/legion-pro-5-gen-8-(16-inch-amd)/82wm0000us#reviews\n\nhttps://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadp/thinkpad-p15v-gen-3-(15-inch-amd)/21em0034us\n\nThx a lot !"
