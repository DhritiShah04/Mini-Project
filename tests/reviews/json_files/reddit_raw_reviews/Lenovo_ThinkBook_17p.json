  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",
  "This is why I'm planning to upgrade my X1 carbon g5 to g13. It will be expensive, but it will be worth it I hope.",
  "i have one, i love it and find it enjoyable but im not a lappy connoisseur like you ive only had desktops for last decade, i will monitor this touchpad thing and touchscreen issue, but i use a bt mouse mostly, and i dont have this glow on the screen, or not that i notice, everything else seems manageable\n\ntry one more replacement, what other options are there right now? i dont think it looks or feels cheap. i like same things as you, the usb c on both sides, i like the weight and solid feel, the shiny bright screen, speakers, fast solid bt and wifi, keyboard, low bloatware, amazing battery and playing gta v\n\nmy bt 5.3/4 can let me use my earphones all the way in the shower room which i couldnt do with my previous 5.1 or whatever, thats big life immprovement for me\n\ni feel the top function row of keys the backlight bleeds through the bottom of the row a bit much depending on angle but not a big deal",
  "This is a very interesting review. Currently not many reviews for this model. Have you got chance to try other Lunar Lake models?",
  "Nice review! Would you mind sharing how the Aura's screen compares to the SL7 you previously had? And how the fan noise in the SL7 was for you in the same setup you mentioned with external monitor?",
  "Thanks for this insightful review.\nRegarding the fan noise, is it possible to use tpfancontrol (or more recent) to customise it ? On both T15 (Gen 1) and L14 they work well to start the fan sooner than the firmware does, but I do not know whether it is possible to delay the fan startup...\nThanks,\nP.S. : additional question : what is the lowest rpm that tpfancontrol can achieve ?",
  "I noticed a big difference in performance after uninstalling the bloatware. Battery is great, response is snappy, touchpad is fine, not great, screen is lovely.

Best non Mac I’ve ever owned, and I think the x1 carbon will be better in terms of build quality but couldn’t see myself doubling the cost for materials and same specs. \n\nAll in all, a very solid, reliable piece of equipment.",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",
  "For me, the biggest issues so far:\n\n1. Occasional phantom touches - similar to the OP\n\n2. eGPU compatibility (GPD G1) - it used to work with meteor lake laptop which I had (YogaBook 9i).

  "  \nI have had this laptop for a week. I have updated everything that needed updating (Windows and all relevant drivers). Everything is fine except for the Wi-Fi, which is very slow. I usually connect it to my phone’s hotspot (an S23 Ultra), and when I tested it with Ookla Speedtest, the download speed never exceeded 180 kb/s (0.18 Mb/s), while the upload speed reached up to 4 Mb/s. It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do? I bought this from BestBuy in the U.S., but I’m currently not in the United States. While returning it is not impossible, it would be very difficult, and I would prefer to resolve the issue without having to return it.",

  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues.

For example, unless it's one of the newest MacBook pros, you might be used to an incredibly glossy screen that leads to a busted user experience if there are windows or uncontrolled lights nearby.\n\nMy M1 Max MacBook Pro was also incredibly laggy for things like window snapping and some other things where I couldn't get rid of the animation and you just have to wait for part of a second from time to time before you can do things.\n\nPretty amazing that it compares to a multi-thousand dollar laptop, but also multi-thousand dollar laptops these days can be pretty disgusting, or at least that has been my experience with the M1 Max, and some Windows laptops from Dell, Asus, and Framework being laggy with windows 11.\n\nMaybe it's just a software problem though and I shouldn't be comparing wildly inefficient operating systems like Mac OS and Windows 11 to things like debloated Windows 10 or Linux on a 12-year-old Thinkpad originally rated for 24 hours of battery life.",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "How do the speakers compare to the MBP?  Thx",
  "I currently have the G16 and the aura and when it comes to speaker quality, these two are pretty close. the G16 has a slightly fuller bass and slightly wider sound stage. In my opinion if the G16 are a 10, the Aura speakers are a 9.5. I also feel the browsing experience to be much better on the Aura. I experience more lag on the G16 and the fans kick on, the SOC can get too hot for the G16 to sit on the lap, even with light browsing. That being said the track pad on the G16 is better. while the keyboard on the Aura is much better",
  "I was thinking of buying this but it has way too much bass, since I listen to music a lot that's a dealbreaker for me. Also, the bass resonates across the laptop body which creates a weird sensation if you're typing while listening to music. I tried adjusting equalizer in dolby software but still couldn't get the sound right. Did you find a solution to eliminate bass (so chassis doesn't resonate) and music becomes clear?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "I just did, looks good from any angle.",
  "Thanks for your review. I finally decided not to buy this model (it's in my cart for a few days).",
  "Thanks for the insight. Where did you see others complaining about the touchpad issue? If it's not isolated to my machine I'm afraid it may be drivers / firmware.",
  "sounds like an issue with Intel ultra series 2 to be honest.  \n  \ncan anyone who has tested other series 2 intel laptops confirm?",
  "I wud return it for the annoying spinning wheel alone",
  "I wish the X1 carbon line still had good IPS panels. OLED isn't for me. P14s gen 5 has a nice 120hz 3k IPS, I might consider that one.",
  "Hey, I'm thinking of picking up this machine, but I'm curious to know how much battery life you're getting?",
  "Haven't tried any other Lunar Lake laptops as of yet. There will allegedly be a SL7 for business with Lunar Lake next year, thinking about waiting for that. Though knowing Microsoft they'll charge an arm and a leg for 32Gb.",
  "I also posted a review of SL7 a few months ago if you wanted to have a look. The SL7's display is pretty comparable to the Aura's. It had worse PPI (201 vs 222), and worse subjective calibration making it bit washed out, but didn't have the IPS glow issues of the Aura. The AR coating was also better. I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve. The chassis would get way too warm in heavier tasks and the fan would hardly do anything. But still, I prefer the SL7's acoustics. No noise in a docked setup.",
  "Cant seem to get it working on the Aura.",
  "What did you uninstall? ",
  "Which bloatware did you remove?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "Thanks for the recommendation on uninstalling the bloatware.  Any update on the laptop?",
  "It's annoyingly reflective. And it's a pitty because under the perfect conditions it's really nice to look at. But it's a laptop so conditions change and are rarely perfect",
  "Is it a problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "The low RPM noise isn’t too bad, it’s just the fact it’s there at all that irks me. It’s completely unnecessary to have such an aggressive fan curve with a Lunar lake chip inside, but I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker. \n\nThe eye strain comes from the GPU, not the glossy display surface. Same strain when docked. Seems to be recent intel GPU’s from what I’ve read, causing issues for those sensitive to dither, or whatever rendering technique it is that causes the pain.",
  "The Aura screen dimensions are compatible with the MacBook Air 15. Get a MBA 15 compatible matte screen protector, and it'll greatly reduce glare and reflections on the Aura.",
  "was this 16 or 32gb of ram?",
  "BTW, as an update to my experience, I have my touchscreen replaced as it seems to be touchscreen issue instead of touchpad. For a week, touchwood, no such touchpad issues anymore.\n\nThe only remaining gripe I have would be the lack of compatibility with my GPD G1.",
  "Have you uninstalled McAfee already? It will greatly improve system performance. The Microsoft antivirus software built in Windows is better. That's probably the first thing to do after unpacking a new Lenovo laptop.",
  "It's really subjective. Do you have any issues with other modern devices? In laptops I find Intel Xe iGPU's to be bad for eye strain, Nvidia perfectly fine, AMD tolerable but not ideal.",
  "For my ghost touches issue, turns out I went to Lenovo repair centre to have screen replaced, then as of these weeks the ghost touch issue is gone for me.",
  "how did it go? did you send it in and is it still working?",
  "Hello \n\nI am going to buy this laptop soon.\n\nIs there display glare problem a deal breaker?  \nSome people mentioned : glossy displays leading to poor battery life because you have to crank up brightness to max to combat glare.\n\nThanks",
  "Its not easy to buy a laptop nowadays. many models and there are issues on each model. No windows laptop is perfect it seems, unless you pay big amount to Thinkpad series highend one.",
  "Luckily the 15.3\" screen is the same size as the Macbook Air 15, so you could pick up a matte screen protector.",
  "[I just reviewed it](https://smbtech.au/features/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-aura-edition-laptop-review/) and got 26.5 hours. That's a new record on my site.",
  "After using for some time, I think it’s similar to surface laptop screen. It’s reflective but with decent resolution. Colors are vibrant. I mostly work inside so it’s been fine. Working outside might be slightly tough because the screen is pretty reflective (not as good coating as MacBook). If you turn up the brightness to 100% that might make it better for outside work.",
  "I think the same, if not even better.   So loud and clear and good bass too.   I've tested both the 14\" and the 15.3 and had zero issues.  I think the one this person is talking about was just a lemon",
  "Not really, I just got used to it.",
  "Barely but yes. You can be outside (in the shade of course) and make do while in light mode. It's a mirror though, so you gotta find the right angle.",
  "Thank you so much - I really appreciate it. This makes it a buy for me. ",
  "Glad I could help make that tough decision! Not many choices right now that are similar to Yoga 7i Aura Edition but hoping we get some new releases soon...",
  "I read about a couple folks mentioning unresponsive touchpad in some YouTube comments and in r/lenovo comments as well",
  "You probably don't need this anymore but its around 8 hours minimum for demanding stuff, WAY higher with regular use. Much more than one needs. If you plan on using it for several days in a row, just bring the charger.",
  "As I sit here looking at my non-upgradeable to Windows 11 Surface Book 2.  You felt and looked premium, I paid a lot for your middle tier processor, I learned what heat throttling was, sometimes you think the screen is disconnected when it isn't, we had a good run. No more MS laptops for me thanks.",
  "Just read it, some great detailed insights there. Definitely swaying me towards getting the SL7, especially given the low/no noise from the fans which is very important to me. Thanks for replying!",
  "How would you compare the screen reflectivity between the SL7 and the Aura? Still waiting for my Aura to arrive",
  "OK, thanks for trying, it is good to know that it is not compatible... by the way, there are several variants, depending on the model (eg 1 or 2 fans) : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qjlal2/tpfan_control_on_newer_thinkpads_share_your/\n\nOn the Aura, there is also a built-in BIOS configured power management, accessible through Fn+Q command : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1fufeoa/lenovo_yoga_slim_7i_aura_edition_ama/lqcjek5/",
  "What if you set the performance/fan mode to quiet? Does that make it quiet enough? I'm thinking of getting this too and have heard mixed reviews about fan noise",
  "Ya, it’s been hit or miss on battery life. Touchpad gets finicky w longer use, appears to be pretty sensitive to the oils on the skin and any grime so I try to use the mouse. I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",
  "Its actually not too bad in person (at best buy) when viewed side by side to the book 4 screen.   I think the book 5 screen has more anti-reflective coating and they did not have that model for testing.",
  "Is the reflection problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "Does anyone tried this?",
  "It had been on sales for £1100 for the Aura 258V 32GB RAM model in the UK (e.g. Lenovo Store, Currys).",
  "Yes the 32 GB version with Intel 258V. Seems like some of the discounts are now gone.",
  "I have the same ghost touch issue, sending it in for repair under warranty in 2 days.  \nhow was you experience with the repair and is it still working?  \nAsking since i have heard many bad things about Lenovo's repair service.",
  "May i ask if you’ve found a solution for connecting to the gpd g1? I am looking to buy a compact egpu to use with the slim 7i aura on the go. 🙏",
  "That was one of the first things I did",
  "I'm looking to replace an old Dell XPS 9360 laptop with the following specs: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz 2.00 GHz. If I had no eye strain issues with this, do you think I should be ok with the Slim 7i Aura?",
  "Tell me how the type of graphics card can affect eye strain. Eye strain and other discomforts are caused by PWM and temporal dithering. These are defects or characteristics of displays, and intervening components are unlikely to be the cause, but I could be wrong. Please comment.",
  "I exchanged it",
  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast. The screen is very glossy though. if you work in a very bright room with bright background/light behind you, then yeah it can be very annoying to clearly see your reflection on the screen even at 80% brightness. it's depends see if you can find a sample in the nearest store.",
  "I like your little candy cane for scale",
  "Can you share me the settings that you have used while testing this and was there any major tweaks done to this? I got the same laptop but seems like my idle drain is little bit higher, although I did clean install of windows.",
  "Is it good?",
  "HP's new OmniBook Flip looks good, but its battery is a bit small. Maybe I'll wait for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura edition. It'll be very expensive at the release time though.",
  "A few alternatives appeared in recent months:\n\n[**MSI Prestige 14 AI Evo C1MG**](https://smbtech.au/features/msi-prestige-14-ai-evo-c1mg-laptop-review-2024/) – MSI’s, matte-screened 14-inch, business-oriented rival is larger, but more powerful.

  "Ah, interesting. Looks like a universal issue then.",
  "Both are glossy glass surfaces, but I remember the SL7 looked less reflective. The aura can look a bit mirror-like at times.",
  "My bluetooth is awful.  I can pair all devices, but they will NOT stay connected.  My earbuds connected, and I was able to use them for about 1 minute or so, but I could only get the Right side to receive sound.

The internet is full of people with the same bluetooth issue.",
  "Yes, a few people on reddit shared their experience of this already. They said the outcome is comparable to the new M4 nano texture screen coating. Less reflection but more grainy, as you would expect.",

  "You could try to check if the problem is related to your Windows install, or a hardware issue (e.g. WiFi chip, antenna connection). \n\nOne relatively easy way would be to create a Linux bootable USB stick (e.g. Ubuntu). Boot up from the Linux USB stick and check the WiFi speeds. \n\nIf the speeds in Linux are normal, you could then try a \"clean install\" of Windows (download Windows USB install media from Microsoft website).\n\nIf the WiFi speed in Linux is also very low, then it might be worth opening up the laptop and checking the WiFi chip and antennas (does not void warranty). Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",
  "Did you exchange with the same model? Or what else did you get instead?",
  "Understand it looks like a deal breaker to me, however spec is really good on this pc.",
  "this comment is making me crack up ideky",
  "Disable all start-up apps, put it in flight mode, ensure all drivers and apps are up to date, drop the screen to the lowest visible setting, ensure it's cooled down before running the test.",
  "ThinkPads have great build quality, the 14 inch a bit too small for me tho. HP removed top firing speakers form Omnibook and no more USB-A port either.",
  "That's a nice list, thanks.",
  "I can see you currently have ranked the [MSI Prestige 14 AI Evo C1MG](https://smbtech.au/features/msi-prestige-14-ai-evo-c1mg-laptop-review-2024/) at #10 due to the price of your printing of **$1,899** (was formally your #1) with an Intel Core Ultra 5 (125H).  \nIm seeing priced at $1399 across multiple webshops sporting an Intel Core Ultra 7 (155H) - to me that represents even greater value, do you think its battery would be as efficient battery wise as the (U5-125H) that you reviewed?",
  "Yeah, for some reason it worked fine for me or maybe I just didn't notice it. I think a few BIOS updates can fix some of these pesky annoying issues in otherwise an ideal laptop.",
  "Now I'm thinking to just get the Yoga Pro 9i with the IPS. Should check all the boxes. Just not the battery life",
  "It is a glossy screen, so some glare is there, but not anything significant to be a deal breaker. Battery life has been excellent so far, usually lasts 5 to 8 hours on a single charge of 80%.",
  "Thank you for these suggestions, and I think I will try it. Can you please provide me with a link to such a Linux Bootable Stick download? I know I can search for it, but I feel you can provide me with a tested (and safe) solution.\n\nmeanwhile I found an acceptable solution using a tp-link wifi dongle",

  "You're welcome. I made it as part of my Aura review, [here](https://smbtech.au/news/datadog-showcases-expanded-ai-ml-and-aws-monitoring-features-at-reinvent/).",
  "If it's dropped like that again it will be Number 1, or very near it. Prices are a rollercoaster at this time of year and there's not much in it. There's a whisker between these and choosing what suits you best will leave you with a great laptop either way.",
  "The 9i looks like a nice machine especially with mini-LED, but the chassis is quite cheaply made, like the Pro 7. All plastic interior, including the hinge assembly.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

So you may have to try the links a few times. \n\nIf you have good WiFi speeds with an external USB WiFi dongle then this is also indicative of a hardware issue. I suggest you find a friend who can help you check out the WiFi inside your laptop.",
  "For the benchmarks, i go for the max possible score. I'll have Windows Set to Best Power efficiency and the Vendor's app set to maximum efficiency (no overclocking, USB charging turned off, silent mode if not low power, disable diacreet GPU if relevant etc).

  "hi I am someone using this laptop for a month. Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo. I have a desktop that goes 165hz and that's more for gaming. sure it's smooth and all but eh not worth the batt life tradeoff).\n\nif you realllly wanna stretch the life, use MS edge as ur browser cuz that's the least battery draining browser out there.

  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience). I have a Lenovo duet 5 now which I love but the snapdragon is feeling a little long in the tooth when I have more than a few tabs open.\n\nI guess my heart says Lenovo but brain said MacBook Air.",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop. Having good speakers is a great bonus for the Lenovo for me, as well as a bright screen. Don't need maximum power as for heavy workload I want to rely on remote desktops.",
  "Check your local best buys, in my area (SE Michigan) the Lenovo is on BB as a used excellent for $530 which is the right price point. So see if you can find one in your area for that price",
  "Unfortunately not near me but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nWhat do you think the chances of the kompanio lasting close to apple silicon?",
  "Not sure, thats a ChatGPT quesiton lol \n\nHappy hunting, hopefully you can find one soon.   I hear that they are high-end Chromebooks with Spandragon x Elite processors coming; I'm hoping they are here just before the holiday season.",
  "Ended up with the m4 MacBook air. It went on sale on Amazon for 750(!) and I can't find the Lenovo near me. Also mixed in the surface laptop for fun but the air just seems too good. Thanks again for your help!",

  "Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Gen 6: First impressions I purchased the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G6, model 21NQCTO1WWBR1 on July 2025 and would like to make my impressions about this product:\n\nDESIGN AND BUILD: We don't have much to comment on the design, as it's quite minimalist. We're surprised that not all the keyboard keys follow Lenovo's signature layout, as is typical on IdeaPads, but at least the Ctrl and Fn keys are in their traditional positions, unlike ThinkPads. The light color isn't bad, but it's a shame there wasn't a darker color option (not black, which is typically only seen on ThinkPads, but a darker gray would have been nice). The touchpad is a good size. We found the number of ports interesting, but the Ethernet port's position wasn't particularly helpful, being on the right side. It's interesting that it also has an SD card reader. The number of LEDs also caught our attention, with one next to each USB-C port, in addition to the power button itself (which we really like being separate from the keyboard). We liked the backlit keyboard and the dedicated \"?\", \"/\", \"°\", and \"Menu\" keys, although they sacrificed one of the Ctrl keys. At least it didn't come with the \"Copilot\" shortcut. We didn't really like the notch in the webcam area and found it a rather questionable design decision, but we understand its usefulness. We also liked that it came without those infamous labels on the palm rest, just the Intel seal.\n\nSCREEN: We liked the quality of the IPS, but we were disappointed that the screen had excessive IPS Glow at the bottom edge, quite visible with the screen on a black background even in bright light. My brother was okay with it, but I didn't like this defect at all, which I'm already accepting is quite common in current LCD screens, as I've also seen notebooks and even smartphones and tablets from other brands with this issue. It shouldn't happen, but we've come to understand that IPS Glow is now part of the experience of having an IPS LCD screen, which is unfortunate. At least we like the thin bezels.\n\nSOUND AND WEBCAM: Neither impressed in any aspect, but neither disappointed.\n\nBATTERY AND CHARGING: The USB-C charger is interesting. My brother tested it by playing YouTube videos in 1080p with maximum brightness, and it lasted over 5 hours unplugged. For a 60Wh battery, it's an okay battery, but it could be better.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND USABILITY: Regarding performance, considering its specifications, I consider it okay. It worked very well even for running virtual machines via VirtualBox. We didn't notice excessive heat on the keyboard when heavily loaded. My brother installed the Big Linux distro, and in testing, it has worked well, including mirroring the laptop screen to our Smart TV wirelessly. My brother was unable to get BlissOS, based on Android 13, to work, as it didn't recognize Wi-Fi, but emulating Android on Big Linux with WayDroid has worked well most of the time.\n\n**Have you also purchased a Lenovo ThinkBook? Share your experiences with it in the comments below.**",
  "Looks cool",
  "I got the same laptop, with 8gb of RAM, and im quite satisfied with it. I use it mainly for college stuff, and it can handle an entire day of coding, browsing the internet and even playing some light games (such as Horizon Chase). \n\nBattery life on it is quite impressive on linux. I get 6-8h of usage with it. That's more than i get with Windows (i have no idea why i just get 3-5 hours on Windows), but i've seen some minor compatibility issues on linux, such as the mute key not lighting up or the volume keys getting \"sticky\" (if i hold it a little bit, it goes to max volume or 0), but overall, the laptop is very usable.\n\nI plan to upgrade to 16gb soon, because on my use case, 8gb is too low, especially when i get 16 tabs open for research + some niche software from 10 years and VScode.\n\nOBS: Você é o CAVBR do fórum Adrenaline, não é?",

  "ThinkBook is the more sturdy built and reliable business series. IdeaPad Slim is the more sleek and modern looking, but also more frail consumer design. The \"general\" modern consumer prefers a slim and sleek look over performance and durability these days. That's why ThinkBooks are less popular.",
  "Ok, but when I read about thinkbook, posts in reddit mention it's not that sturdy, as compared with ThinkPad.\n\nAny thinkbook reviews here?",
  "That's because there's a large, devout and old ThinkPad following. And the laptops used to be really solid. But if you check out the r/thinkpad sub, you'll find that the recent years ThinkPads, especially the slimmer designs, have as many complaints as their consumer Yoga or IdeaPad line.\n\nHaving said that the ThinkBook line has also gone through a big transition. Everything approximately before Intel 12th gen was a lot more experimental. The last two years, however, have significantly improved on design and usability. So, the current ThinkBook line (from Intel Ultra and AMD Zen 4+) exemplifies again what a good workstation level laptop should be like. Check out reviews yourself on YouTube.",
  "Thinkpad is a different class, it is sturdier, yes, but it is more expensive, obviously.\n\nHowever! Keep in mind that if you don't expose your laptop to frequent shocks and bumps and drops.. a regular Thinkbook will be just fine, it is not a fragile laptop by any means, it's just that Thinkpads are more massive and heavy.. at least the ones I owned until several years ago..\n\nMy advice - don't go for the most expensive with durability in mind! Laptops can fail you regardless of their price! Go for the cheapest that fulfills your configuration requirements. If it breaks, it breaks.. but chances are it will last just as long as a much more expensive one. As I said, I owned multiple Thinkpads.. yes, they feel (and Are) sturdy.. but the hardware (e.g. motherboard) can give up the ghost just as easily as a cheap one....\n\nI've recently bought the Lenovo V15 G4 IRU... 400 euros... i5-13420H... not the prettiest of the bunch, but .. it just works, the CPU is fantastic, IPS display... And it works well.. stays cooler than most of their 2-in-1 or slim laptops because of poor cooling in such small form factors. And if it fails down the road a few years from now... I won't regret the investment... but as I said... laptops are pretty much the same on the inside.. don't pay insane prices just because the outside is metal or other \"mil spec\" features... it's just a case, a housing... the inside is more or less the same.",

But in a dilemma after reading reviews on quality of ideapad. laptop is going to be safely used for normal tasks, low to none gaming, so okay with 5000 series processor.                                                                                                              others on list were *Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Intel Core i3 1215U* and *ASUS Vivobook 15 (2024) Intel Core i3 1215U*\n\nEmphasis on build quality, cpu and display.\n\n**Will need quick decision as need to buy asap.**",
  "Undecided about which laptop to choose. (HP 255 G10, Lenovo ThinkBook 14, Samsug Galaxy Book 3 or Microsoft Surface Go 3). Hello, I am electrical engineering student, recently I have been offered one laptop of the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHP 255 G10 (AMD Ryzen 5-7530U, 16 Gb ram, 512 Gb ssd)\n\nLenovo ThinkBook 14 (Intel core i5-1135G7, 8 Gb ram, 256 Gb ssd)\n\nSamsug Galaxy Book 3 (Intel core i5-1335U, 8 Gb ram, 256 Gb)\n\nMicrosoft Surface Go 3 (Intel Pentium Gold 6500Y, 8 gb ram) with keyboard\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt will be used mostly for word and excel, and some light programs psim, femm, lt spice. \n\nIt will be good if it could run Matlab for simple simulations in simulink (for more complex simulations I have a good PC in my house and in the university I can use a remote desktop) and some old games like Morrowind, Hearts of iron 3, Hoi darkest hour, fallout 2... (If anyone could move Hearts of Iron 4 it would be great, but I doubt it) but  it's not a necessity.\n\n   \nI only take into account the surface because with a digital pen can be used to take notes and its portability, because I think the CPU is underpoweret even for use office and edge at the same time.\n\nI think in general the best option is the HP 255 G10 because it has more RAM and ssd storage and the i5-1335U is only a bit better than Ryzen 5-7530U (from what I have seen on the internet) but   \nI've heard people complaining that HP computers are flimsy, especially the ones that aren't high-end and for a laptop that  is going to be used every day outside the home, and I am going to carry it in my backpack with a cover, I am worried that it could be damaged or broken. \n\n I have looked for reviews of the hp, but I have not seen the exact model, so if any of you have used this laptop  and can tell me what the build quality is like or think that one of the other laptop is better    \nI would appreciate the help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for my English, I know it's pretty bad, but I'm trying to improve it.",
  "Lenovo ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 or HP EliteBook 845 G8  ThinkPad could either be a Yoga with a Intel Core i7-1165G7 processor or a regular X13 with a Ryzen 7 5850U processor. Both have 16GBs of RAM.\n\nThe EliteBook has a Ryzen 7 5850U processor and 32GBs of RAM.\n\nEvidently, the EliteBook has better specs, though I'm concerned largely here with build quality, emissions, and battery life. Information on the EliteBook is sparse and data related to the ThinkPads seem to be inconsistent (i.e. reviews claiming it has between 3 and 14 hours of battery life while streaming), so I'm wondering if anybody here might have some insight on either.\n\nPrice is not a consideration.",
  "Zen 3 mobile (5000 series) is decently well optimized in laptops on average in terms of performance and efficiency (especially thermals as well), so in my personal opinion (and from experience with using them at my workplace, a computer repair store), I trust the battery life of laptops with Ryzen CPUs inside more than those with 11th or 12th gen Intel CPUs.\n\nMost manufacturers set the default power limits too high for an otherwise modern ultrabook class of computer, just to eke out as much performance as they can in exchange for momentary bursts in temperature and power draw, compared to computers in the past.\n\ntl;dr: Elitebook 845 G8 is better because of the CPU it uses which offers both better performance and power efficiency over \"equivalent\" Intel offerings.\n\nHP also uses a mostly metal chassis as well, which are built fairly sturdily/solid from experience of using them, while recent ThinkPads tend to default more towards hard plastic for a good portion of laptops, if not, then a hybrid between hard plastic and magnesium/aluminium, (mixed experiences, some models have varying levels of chassis flex while others are fine).",
  "Lenovo Thinkbook 14s  \n\nHello, i live in argentina and I am a computer engineering student. I will use my laptop mainly for coding and i plan to install ubuntu in a virtualbox vm.\n\nI came across the lenovo thinkbook 14s with 16 ram and 512gb storage at an excellent price.

  "Lenovo vs HP for multitasking I’m starting a new job soon and am having trouble picking between these two laptops. My job (attorney) involves heavy multitasking and multiple monitors (3-4). I’m looking at these two laptops below and would appreciate some advice. I’m looking at Best Buy specifically. My firm is paying but I want to be respectful of cost. I’d also be open to any suggestions for monitors in the 100-200 range. \n\nhttps://www.bestbuy.com/product/lenovo-yoga-7i-2-in-1-16-2k-touchscreen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-7-155u-with-16gb-memory-1tb-ssd-storm-grey/JJGYCX6PWR\n\nPros: Lots of Positive Reviews, Lenovo is a trustworthy brand, good specs\n\nCons: I won’t be using the 2 in 1 feature, several reviews mention the screen having a lot of glare for when I use it without a monitor or as an additional screen.\n\nhttps://www.bestbuy.com/product/hp-17-3-full-hd-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-1tb-ssd-natural-silver/JJGH2YK4ZP\n\nPros: Anti Glare Screen, good specs, large screen when I use without monitor. \n\nCons: HP as a brand is a bit of hit and miss in my experience. \n\nEdit: I’ve looked at the thinkpads as well but unfortunately all of the Best Buy’s near me don’t have them in stock and I’m on a bit of a time crunch. I’m going through BB because I have their premium membership which includes free geek squad repair/support. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on Dell? I’ve used the latitude 3520 for the past three years through my old job and it’s worked well. \n\nEdit 2: Any thoughts on this Dell Laptop?\n\nhttps://www.bestbuy.com/product/dell-15-6-2k-touchscreen-laptop-intel-core-i7-1355u-2023-16gb-memory-1tb-storage-carbon-black/J3K4L6J6ST",

Both Lenovo and HP in the \"lower\" tiers will have some issues/ failures so brand loyalty won't get you far.\n\nIf you can, consider springing for an ARM laptop (unless some software doesn't allow for it) as they're usually far more superior battery wise. Otherwise; choose for specs/ ports and price/ dimensions (carrying around a 17 inch is not as easy if you'll be out and about)\n\nDon't go below 16GB RAM, pick any modern CPU and...good luck.",

  "I'm also a lawyer, but when I think of 3-4 monitor set ups, I think of financial applications and bloomberg terminals. If your employer is restricting you to a single PC (as opposed to a desktop and a companion tablet/laptop), I recommend you get *any* Lenovo Thinkpad L or T series or literally any HP Elitebook. (HP's Elite line has the same reliability and long term support as the Thinkpads). 16 gb RAM will be enough. Unless you expect to be dealing with video files (I regularly get 100's of gbs of body camera footage to analyze each month), 512gb storage should be enough. \n\nYou will want an external blu-ray burner so you can archive/back-up your files and for sharing discovery with outside counsel. As far as monitors, I suggest you get a single 32\" or larger display. If you somehow need more screen real estate, you can leave the screen open on the PC when it's docked.\n\nAs far as a dock, get a Thunderbolt dock, so you have a single cable going into your laptop that includes power.\n\nSince you're buying this for firm work, have the firm just spec and order it from HP or Lenovo. That way you can also get it configured with a 5 year extended support contract that includes on-site support by an HP or Lenovo technician and *accidental* damage protection.",

Hey everyone,\nI’ve been managing a ton of stuff lately — from work meetings, video calls, and docs to occasional photo/video edits, and sometimes even running VMs or testing tools. I’m not a gamer, but I do need a machine that won’t freeze when I’ve got 15 tabs, Excel, and VS Code open at once.\n\nAfter a lot of research, comparisons, spec checks, and price scouting, I’ve shortlisted a few laptops under ₹60,000 that look promising for all-around heavy multitasking\n\n1.

Infinix InBook Air Pro+ (i5, 16GB, 1.24kg)\nUltraportable, 13th Gen i5\n\nLooking for your opinions:\nAm I missing a better option under 60K?\nAny red flags I should be aware of?\n",

  "1. Overpriced like any other HP/Dell consumer grade laptop. Too overpriced. Back out of it.\n\n2. Best in its price range. 7735HS even better.\n\n3. It's good honestly. But what price? Well if it's 60k you can better get an LOQ 13450HX+3050 in the August sale.\n\n4. Not bad. No iGPU so terrible battery life but 90wh and HS makes it easier quite. But overpriced. 13450HX+3050 line here again.\n\n5. It's good. Great for it's price but your usecase or the amount of other options makes it a little sus. Also Acer's service/build is not really good, Victus > Acer.\n\n7. Now we are talking terms. 13500H is good although I believe it doesn't 96EU, instead it has 80EU. But for OLED it is good.\n\n8. Yeah no. This and the first. Both nope out. After-sales/reliability issues and all kind.\n\nWhat you are missing? \n\nThinkBook 14 gen 8 with 225H which you can get under 60k.\n\nIdeaPad slim 5 Ryzen 7 7735HS.\n\nSo these two and the Asus are your options. If you want OLeD you may go for Asus but your work wants good iGPU and there's a bit of a trust issue I am having there. 225H is brilliant but ThinkBook has an NTSC screen which is an off for 60k budget (Not for those who buy a 15s for 70k but for those who know options).\n\nSo it's either sRGB but a powerful iGPU vs OLED but mid iGPU here.

I have searched for some laptops with large screen (>=15\"), portable (probably less than 2.2kg) and wifi 7, including the new processors and a discrete gpu. \n\nThen I have found several laptops with the price I found, all are new and converted to US dollar, price vary by the processor 7 or 9\n\n\\- dell xps 16 9640 core ultra 9 4060: $1300\n\n\\- asus proart p16 4060 ryzen AI 9 $1700\n\n\\- lenovo yoga pro 9i aura edition 5060: $1650\n\n\\- lenovo thinkbook p16 gen 6 core ultra 5060: $1350-1650\n\n\\- lenovo legion 5i gen 10  core ultra 5060: $1300-1400\n\n\\- lenovo legion 7i gen 10 core ultra 5060: $1550- 1650\n\n\\- msi creator a16 AI+ 4060 ryzen AI: \n\n\\- msi stealth 16 AI studio 4060 core ultra 9: $1370\n\n\\- msi summit e16 core ultra 4060: $1650\n\n\\- msi summit A16 AI+ core ultra 4060: $1700\n\n\\- msi prestige 16AI studio core ultra 4060: $1700-1850\n\n\\- dell inspiron 16 plus 7640 core ultra 4060: I have not found one with wifi 7\n\nIf you have used one of these please give me some review about it like the battery the fan noise, GPU (some like the summit e16 has only 55w which may not fully use the 4060),... \n\nAlso, based on the price, with my budget about 1300-1400, which one should I buy, if the laptop worth the price, I would probably raise my budget to $1700-1800\n\nThank you",
  "The thin laptops are going to run hot while playing AAA games due to lack of room for good cooling.\n\nThey will all do well with everything besides the AAA gaming, unless you run lower settings to control the heat and they are all solid laptops.\n\nI have seen a lot of posts about MSI build quality not being great, maybe the business ones are better.",

  "Laptop for college So I am in need of a new laptop for college as a nursing major and needed some recommendations. I saw these two options and wanted to know some opinions on them. I was thinking the Lenovo would be good cause then I would be able to also use it also a tablet if I wanted to use notes or something like that and it is on sale. Or would it just be better to get a m2 or m4 MacBook. ",
  "get the lenovo yoga\n\nbetter performance in games + more options for software depending on mojor",
  "Apple also has a deal for students to get the m4 MacBook  for $900+ AirPods so that’s also an option",
  "Take the Lenovo unless you have a specific need for the MacBook (Battery life would be one of them for a college student)\n\nIt might also be that the major you're taking has specific software that may only work on a Windows Laptop (You'd need to enquire on this) and that would rule out the MacBook anyway.\n\nThat's just my opinion.",
  "Let me get this out of the way first: for nursing, Windows and macOS work just fine. You shouldn’t be running into any compatibility issues, and the computing needs is so low. Even proctored exam sites work perfectly on ARM MacBooks, something that can’t be said about ARM Windows or Android.\n\nThe Yoga makes more sense if you need the tablet feature or touchscreen, though keep in mind the touchscreen has palm rejection issues, so use an artist glove if you need to. The stylus is not included at Best Buy; only on Lenovo’s website does it include the stylus with the laptop. It also has a USB-A port, which is what my nursing program required for lab (specifically for scanners), so you don’t need a dongle. The additional storage is nice to have, and you can replace it anytime you want. The OLED display is also great for media consumption, even if the speakers aren’t a match for the MacBook. I’d argue the keyboard is way better for extended typing on the Yoga thanks to the 1.5mm key travel, and that’s with the chassis rigidity being on par with the MacBook. You can charge the Yoga on either side, something the MacBook can’t do. It’s also x86 Windows, so you get the broadest software library including games. The AMD variant has a tasteful light chassis color, but makes the white LED keyboard lights harder to read due to the lack of contrast. In that regard, the Intel model’s gray color is more functional, as is the black colored keys on the MacBook.\n\nThe MacBook still has better battery life ‘cause the M2 draws less power than the Ryzen 5 340 on idle and light use, even with the Yoga’s larger battery. My classroom has so few outlets, so battery life was particularly important for me. That’s while the M2 has slightly higher single core performance, so this aging 2022 MacBook will still feel slightly snappier than a 2025 Yoga, and zero fan noise due to the lack of fans. The display is higher resolution, so text will look crisper and everything is more functional with the extra pixels. Both laptops have glossy panels, but the MacBook has higher brightness to combat reflections in bright rooms. The integration between Apple devices is mostly smooth, which adds a lot of versatility to your school experience. You can text your friends in class without whipping out your phone, which is handy for sharing notes and thoughts stealthily. It’s also a lighter device, approx. 0.5 lbs lighter than the Yoga, and thinner too.\n\nAs someone who likes to game on occasion, likes to illustrate, and prefers Windows overall, the Yoga with stylus is a natural winner for me (that’s what I ended up buying), but I would shop for the Intel variant first for its superior GPU for games and MacBook level battery life on a Windows laptop, even if it’s pricier than AMD. The 226V Yoga goes for about $700 on a discount at Best Buy (it’s sadly not discounted right now). I got the 256V for $800 when it was on discount. Please do not buy at MSRP. The Intel model gets discounted less frequently, likely due to popularity, so you have to be a patient shopper for it.\n\nTo me, how I rank these laptops for my use case (mainly school), it’s Intel Yoga 7i > M2 MBA > AMD Yoga 7, though weirdly enough this is also coincidentally ordered based on pricing. As some who gets serious FOMO, I personally skipped AMD for this year’s Yoga 7 lineup ‘cause I find the Intel one is better for school for the battery life difference, but otherwise I think the AMD Yoga 7 is still fairly well rounded and great on a tighter budget, and battery life is still decent.",

That being said - it’s still very usable and opens you up to apps that work great on Mac compared to just ok on windows.

  "Thinkpad or Zephyrus My current laptop (Surface Book 2 13.5) is still doing quite well but I'm looking to upgrade, mostly because of performance restraints and reliance on cloud for ML tasks. I work with applied AI but all the tooling I need from work is provided, but I want to have more power for my tinkering outside of work.\n\nI have narrowed it down to 2 options: The Lenovo Thinkpad P1 Gen 7 or the Asus Zephyrus G16\n\n\n\nThe Thinkpad is on sale for £1800 with the following specs:\n\nIntel® Core™ Ultra 7 165H vPro® Processor\n\n4060 8Gb 60W\n\n32Gb (upgradable, but expensive to do so)\n\n1Tb\n\n16\" 3840x2400 IPS 60Hz\n\n\n\nAnd the Zephyrus G16 is more modern and also not on sale (\\~£2650) with the following specs:\n\nIntel® Core™ Ultra 9 Processor 285H\n\n5070ti 12Gb 120(?)W\n\n32Gb (soldered)\n\n1Tb\n\n16\" 2560 x 1600 OLED 240Hz\n\n\n\nMy usage consists of the following:\n\nMy laptop goes about 13 hours between long charges, with 4-6 of those being light usage (coding/web browsing/reading and highlighting academic papers) and the rest is just idle with screen off and shut. I can charge it with a very low wattage USB-C connection when out. When I'm at home and I have the main charger I will often be hooked up via USB-C to an external monitor, I'll do more coding and web browsing but I'll also be running ML models (mostly Graph Neural Networks and Multi Agent RL - not LLMs). I also don't train locally, but having the ability to prototype small models before I send it up to the cloud and leave it to train would be useful. I do also want to perform data processing with pandas locally. Aside from that whilst I do game it's only League of Legends/Minecraft so I don't need to worry about running AAA games. I'm looking to use this laptop for the next 5+ years so having longevity in mind is important, although if the Thinkpad becomes outclassed because it is cheaper I'd be okay with upgrading earlier.\n\nI haven't been able to see either of them in person to get a feel for them, and I can't decide off of specs and reviews alone, so hoping I can get some help deciding. \n\nOne final and somewhat important point is I am British, I prefer the English UK ISO layout - which means a big enter key, if that is or isn't possible on the laptop that does have some sway in my decision.\n\nI am also somewhat open to suggestions. I have also considered:\n\n\\- MacBook Pro - but I need windows/WSL and x86 (as well as NVIDIA for local CUDA)\n\n\\- Framework 16 - I don't think the 16 system is mature enough yet, especially for the cost",

  "Comparing 2020 Macbook Air M1 with Asus TUF F15 AMD Ryzen 7 6800h RTX 3050 Ti I did a search comparing these two laptops because I'm more of a casual user and light gamer. I read some posts comparing these two and rather than making a comment there, I figured for posterity (since these are both pretty old) I would say something about them.\n\nI'm on a budget, not much money to work with but still wanted quality. The 2020 Macbook Air with M1 processor was $650 used on Ebay purchased last year, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD. Has been a rock solid laptop, very lightweight, super efficient and runs the host of great Apple softwares (Final Cut Pro, RAW Power, etc). The Asus TUF F15 gaming laptop was $455 shipped (eBay), purchased last week, 2022 model, Ryzen 7 6800h RTX GeForce 3050 TI, 2TB SSD. If I was a college student right now I would be thrilled with either one of these laptops.\n\nThis is my first Windows machine since 2012. I didn't realize how much I don't miss Windows, what a shitshow, incredible amount of bloat. Macs have zero bloat, no annoying questions, nothing to setup, nothing to delete, just go. The Mac has insane battery life. In 30 mins of typical use it might go from 90% to 88%. The power brick went bad on my Asus TUF few days ago. In 30 minutes I watched the battery go from 90% to 60%, WTF?? I hadn't realized the power brick went bad and it kept switching between 144hz refresh rate and 60hz, switching between performance mode and efficiency mode (I was playing a game).\n\nI should explain my gaming needs which are extremely modest. I play Weird Gun Game on Roblox which isn't graphic intensive. The RTX 3050 Ti is more than sufficient to play that game as well as Counterstrike Source. These are the only 2 games I play and I'm not really worried about \"future proofing\" my rig since I don't even play with max settings on the games I'm playing now. I don't need to see every shadow and every reflection.\n\nI started playing Weird Gun Game a month ago while on vacation and really enjoyed it on my Macbook Air. I kept noticing I was dying before it would even show on my screen which bothered me and realized my Mac has 60hz refresh rate and limited graphic processing power. I will say though, the M1 processor is able to do an adequate job and I would probably be happy if I could simply get the 144hz refresh rate.\n\nI also have a 24\" iMac desktop computer with an M3 processor which does allow better and smoother gameplay. However, like the Macbook, it only has 60hz refresh rate so it's limited. As far as the difference between the M1 and M3 processor, it's not a huge difference, it's subtle, I only notice it here and there, but I can tell it's definitely just a tad bit snappier.\n\nThe biggest surprise I'm experiencing with the jump to the Asus TUF laptop is the lower pings. My latency has dropped significantly with the Asus. Apparently the wifi card (Mediatek) on the Asus is really good. I compare both laptops (Asus and Macbook Air) in the exact same spot in my kitchen table which is approximately 15 feet from the wifi router with no obstructions. The difference in latency: with the Macbook Air playing Weird Gun Game I would get around 90ms. The Asus TUF latency would be around 60ms. It's hard to pin point because the latency is always fluctuating but that's the general number.\n\nObviously, your latency will change during the day due to local network traffics. The best latency I have ever gotten with my Macbook Air is around 70ms-80ms. The best latency I have been able to get with the Asus TUF is around 50ms-60ms. Last nite I was playing and it was hovering around 50ms which for me is just outstanding. I have Cox internet for what it's worth and Apple Airport A1521 Extreme Base Station for my wifi router.\n\nSoon as I got my Asus laptop I started playing Weird Gun Game and suddenly I felt like God. I killed the first 23 people I came across which never happens (I'm not that great). There was an immediate boost in my gameplay and the laptop has exceeded my expectations. Sure, the gameplay is indeed smoother, but I would say the biggest improvement has been to my latency which is something nobody ever talks about when they talk about gaming laptops.\n\nI had done my homework and I knew alot of people were upgrading their wifi cards. I know there's a popular upgrade involving the Intel AX210 chipset. I know my laptop is able to take this upgrade easily since the current Mediatek card is not soldered. The only reason I can find to upgrade though, is that the Intel AX210 chipset uses the 6Ghz band. Kind of pointless since my wireless router doesn't do 6Ghz but at least I know. From what I can tell, I wouldn't really experience much of an upgrade, but there really isn't much discussion on this. Has anyone upgraded from the Mediatek wifi card to the AX210? Did you see a boost in performance or lower latency? I'm really curious.\n\nI'm very grateful to one conversation regarding my router settings. I was able to switch to the 5Ghz band for my wifi router and not only has it improved my gaming experience, it has really improved my overall internet experience. Not only is latency lower, but even simple things have improved. Youtube videos load quicker, websites load quicker, everything feels snappier on the 5Ghz band. I had no idea there would be such an improvement over the 2.4Ghz band (I know, sorry I don't know much about these things). Supposedly the 2.4Ghz band is better for range, but I live in a small condo and don't need to cover a large area.\n\nOne unexpected benefit from my Asus laptop over my Macbook Air is the larger screen. The Macbook Air has only a 13\" screen whereas the screen on the Asus is 15\". I have noticed I enjoy watching Youtube videos much more over the Macbook Air. The Asus TUF F15 feels much more cinematic despite the lower overall quality. When I say quality, I'm talking about specs. The max brightness of my Macbook Air is around 400 nits which is really bright. The Asus max is less than 300 nits which isn't very good, but hasn't been an issue and I haven't really noticed. I also know the color rendition on my Macbook Air is extremely accurate as they are color calibrated from the factory. The color rendition on my Asus TUF laptop is only passable. I can't really tell that it only covers 60% of the color gamut, but then again, I haven't really used it for any hardcore video or photo editing since I do that on my Mac.\n\nAlso, because it's been so long since I have owned a Windows machine, I no longer own any software for Windows. I couldn't edit anything on my Asus laptop now if I tried. I used to own the entire Adobe Photoshop Suite with Premier and all that, but back in 2012, it was a standalone product (not a subscription).\n\nI struggled with the many suggestions about getting an Asus TUF laptop with the RTX 4050 processor. The prices were about $150-$200 more. I also looked at the RTX 3060 which is quite a performance boost over the 3050 Ti but again, it was about $150-$200 more which I just couldn't stomach. I'm really on a pretty strict budget and I'm thrilled with what I've got right now. I feel like I can handle anything, the Macbook Air has outstanding all day battery life and the Asus TUF can pretty much handle any games out there. Maybe it can't handle those games on max settings, but it will run.\n\nRegarding the Nvidia processor, I noticed the Asus TUF laptops for this year (2022) seemed to come with the RTX 3050 Ti compared to the Lenovo LOQ 15IRH8 which only came with the standard RTX 3050 and was around the same price. The \"Ti\" designation apparently offers a performance boost somewhere in the range of 10% - 15% over the standard RTX 3050 card. In real world terms, there probably isn't much of a difference, but considering the price I'm paying I'll take any boost in performance I can get.\n\nI compared lots of reviews between the Lenovo LOQ and the Asus TUF books. The build quality is supposedly better on the Asus models but from what I could see on Youtube reviews, all these laptops are plastic constructions and have considerable flexing in the keyboard and screen, especially compared to my Macbook Air which is a unibody design milled from a single block of aluminum. Comparing the two laptops in build construction isn't a comparison, the Asus TUF feels like a cheap plastic laptop, whereas the Macbook Air feels like it's solid state. There's almost zero flex on the Macbook Air (keyboard or the screen).\n\nNoise - Soon as I load up Weird Gun Game the fans on the Asus start spinning hard and do not stop. The upper right corner of the laptop (on the keyboard portion) gets hot and I can feel the hot air being pushed out from the fans. I'm thinking to place some sort of mesh over the air intakes on the bottom to prevent dusts from building up inside cause that's not something I want to deal with in the future.\n\nI tried to download Armoury Crate which is a software that allows you to tweak the color of the keyboard as well as make other changes. The software isn't downloading properly and I haven't been able to change anything but it's not that big a deal to me. I don't even use the keyboard on the Asus.\n\nSpeaking of keyboards, I was lucky enough to score a used wireless Mac keyboard. This keyboard is far superior to the one on the Asus laptop. I even prefer it over the keyboard on the Macbook Air which feel soft and squishy in comparison. If I had to compare the keyboard on the Asus TUF with the Macbook Air, I would give the nod to the Air. The keyboard travel on the Asus is a little longer which makes makes the Air feel a bit more responsive and snappier. The keyboard on the Asus is just bigger in general and I'm not used to the full size keyboard. None of my Apple stuff (24\" iMac, 27\" iMac, 13\" Macbook Air) offers a full size keyboard. I haven't used a full size keyboard since 2012 so it feels foreign to me. It's a good thing I don't use it to game, although I will say the sepia toned colors which are backlighting the keys does look nice and it's exactly the color I would have picked if I had to get stuck with 1 color.\n\nThe power brick on my Asus laptop went out few days ago and it cost me $35 to replace. The lettering was faded on it and I guess it was really used and really old. Now I'm looking at the battery level which is currently at 80% and the plug is getting disconnected every once in a while, uh oh, looks like I have an issue with the power connector. Maybe I can live with it?",
  "I'm looking at lots of posts and I'm shocked at the budgets y'all have. Damn, $2k??? I wish I had that kind of change. My friend bought an Macbook Air last year with M4 chip she spent around $1,500. She's a casual user and not even in College anymore. I told her to get the M1 Macbook Air but she said she wanted something future proof. I think the M4 Macbook Air is overkill for a casual. Fetching emails, watching Youtube videos and surfing the web has never been processor intensive, this won't be changing  in 5 years. My M1 processor will work just as well for these things in 5 years as they are now. Not to mention, in 3 years I'll be able to purchase that Macbook Air with M4 processor for $650 on eBay and I'll be all caught up.\n\nI think anyone spending $2k on a laptop today for college is just crazy. It's total overkill. At this point, you're simply spending for the sake of future proofing because there's no way you actually need all that power now. You could spend a fraction of that on a Asus TUF with RTX 4050 (can get around $650 used) and that laptop really is future proof.",
  "Tbh for your use case I think something in between would make more sense like a lunar lake chip.\n\nThere is a refurbished Acer laptop with the 226v on sale for 400 on eBay. 2 years warranty as well\n\nYou get similar efficiency to the m1 while also usable gaming performance\n\nhttps://ebay.us/m/9d6cHk\n\nBut yeah if you are more serious about gaming then a dgpu is important",
  "Acer Chromebook Plus 714 Review - A Monarch in the making (for Chromebooks) I’ve long been a fan of Acer Chromebooks, mainly because they were one of the first companies that really took ChromeOS seriously and pushed out multiple devices at different price points so people could actually try the platform out. My very first Chromebook back in 2015 was an Acer (and I’ve owned four Acer Chromebooks since then). I loved that original device, even with its limitations in RAM and power at the time. But Acer has come a long way, and now I’ve got my hands on the new Acer Chromebook Plus 714. This one comes with a premium build, pure power, and unexpectedly great battery life.\n\nIt's not a “new release”, but it's the best Chrombook Acer makes, so I had to check it out as I'm on my journey to find the best new Chrombook for me. So let’s get into it.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmbbq2mxr6qf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d3134b2a3c13e924ed1043ba200030769b02d06\n\nThe design looks sharp. It has a premium feel with gold edges against the dark grey finish. The body is solid aluminum, and it really feels like a top-tier machine in hand. Inside, it switches to plastic, but not the cheap kind. It feels solid, comfortable under your palms and wrists, and there’s no flex when typing.\n\nPort selection is solid: two USB-C ports, an HDMI port (which should honestly be standard on every laptop), a headphone jack (another must-have), and USB-A ports. The downside is both USB-C ports are on the left side, which already caused me an issue with charging since my setup needed a right-side port. They could have easily put one on each side, and it feels like a miss.\n\nFor a device at this price, it should also have a fingerprint scanner, standard in my book for anything over $500, especially a Chromebook.\n\nOn the positive side, it’s a 360-degree convertible, so you can flip it into tablet or tent mode, which is surprisingly useful in tight spaces (like on a plane). But here’s the kicker: some versions of the 714 come with a built-in stylus, and mine didn’t. That should’ve been standard across all models at this price point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hr13bs3zr6qf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27f67b6daff371c0c5a569f5f774116c3d5c630e\n\n**Overall Design & Build: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nThis is always the question that unites man: how long does the battery last? The Chromebook Plus 714 runs on Intel’s new **Core Ultra 5 115U chip**, so I was curious how that would balance performance with efficiency. My past Chromebooks with i5 chips had horrible battery life.\n\nAt first, this one seemed the same, barely a few hours, and even dying overnight in sleep mode. But then, after a few days, something clicked. It optimized itself, and the battery life became excellent.\n\n**My normal workflow includes:**\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web) meets 4-5 hours a day\n* Google Messages app\n* YouTube Music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Brightness around 70%\n\nWith that, it pushes through the day, no problem. Even now in week 2, I charged it 5 days ago, used it an hour or two daily, and it still has 43% left. Whatever optimization Intel and Acer did here worked, because my older HP Chromebook x360 14c with an i3 chip can’t even come close.\n\n**Battery Life: A**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nThe keyboard is good, but not great. I have massive “bearpaw” hands, so I judge every keyboard against the HP x360’s, which still holds the crown for me. This one is fine, with decent travel and good response, but the keys could be just a bit bigger.\n\nThe trackpad is excellent, glass-like, very responsive, accurate, and the perfect size. It does pick up fingerprints easily, but that’s par for the course.\n\nAgain, no fingerprint reader in 2025 for a device at this price range, big miss\n\n**Keyboard: B- | Trackpad: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\n# Speakers & Sound\n\nThis is where Acer cut corners. The speakers are weak, tiny, and honestly feel like they came out of a first-gen Chromebook. No bass, not loud, and just flat overall. Even my phone speakers (iPhone or Galaxy) blow these out of the water. At this price point, they should have borrowed the better speakers from their Windows laptops.\n\n**Speakers: D**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance - Intel Core Ultra 5 115U\n\nThis is the biggest surprise. The new Intel Core Ultra 5 architecture delivers real performance gains in a way I haven’t seen on a Chromebook before.\n\nUnlike the new Lenovo Chromebook with the hyped-up MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip (which stuttered constantly and almost crashed during 4K editing for me), this one handled everything I threw at it. With 20–30 tabs open, Teams in the browser, Zoom app running, and editing 4K video in **InShot**, it was smooth and lag-free. Exporting video was fast, and transitions, text, and clip movements were as fluid as they are on my Galaxy Tab S9+.   This chip also allows you to download all the apps from the Google Play store, something I also saw on the Lenovo, but to me I get better performance on this one.\n\nEven with only 8GB of RAM, it didn’t break a sweat. But at this price, I still think Acer should’ve put in 16GB for better future-proofing.\n\nNow, **benchmarks (JetStream and Speedometer)** only show mild improvements over my older HP x360 14c with an i3 from 2021, which is shocking. But in real-world usage, this chip feels much more powerful. Combined with the strong battery life, this is easily one of the best Chromebook chips out right now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nu5xd0z0s6qf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efa740e012bf81d7d2347cc7a25a3c92aeac6f6c\n\n**Performance: A+**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nThe screen is solid with a 16:10 aspect ratio, crisp visuals, accurate colors, and good brightness (rated at 340 nits, more than enough for outdoor use). It doesn’t quite pop like the Lenovo Chromebook Plus screen (that one I really felt like I was there watching an HDR video), but it’s plenty good for work and media.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/je6xl7k3s6qf1.jpg?width=2398&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=401798ec54a6fa5aea7f3e61b28bb62e825ec3d6\n\nThe camera, though, is excellent. It feels like using my Logitech webcam on Windows. It’s AI-enhanced, sharp in low light, and balanced in harsh light. Chromebooks used to skimp here, but this one really impressed me, even rivaling smartphone-level quality on calls.\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Acer Chromebook Plus 714 is a great machine and a clear look at where Chromebooks are headed with Intel’s Core Ultra chips. It’s sleek, powerful, has excellent battery life, and handles pretty much anything you throw at it within ChromeOS.\n\nFor most people who live in web apps (Docs, Gmail, YouTube, Office), this is exactly what you need. And honestly, people dropping $2,000 on “email machines” should be looking at ChromeOS more seriously.\n\nBut it’s not perfect. The missing fingerprint scanner, weak speakers, plastic interior, and lack of a stylus on all models really hold it back. At its original MSRP of $800, it was priced against the MacBook Air, and it’s not quite at that level yet. But at $629 (and even cheaper for open-box units at Best Buy), it’s an easy recommendation.\n\nRight now, this feels like royalty in the Chromebook lineup. Not quite the King yet, but very close. If they make the changes I mentioned, along with overall improvements due to tech available at the time, the 714 will easily be crowned King of Chromebooks. \n\n**Overall Grade: A**   \n**Excellent pickup.**",
  "I have one I bought two years ago.  One of the keys got stuck but I kind of unstuck it.  It's been good but when I tried to trade it in on this Lenovo, they told me they'd give me fifteen bucks for it so I kept it.  So now I have two chromebooks.  The Lenovo 14 Mediatek and the Acer 714 Spin",
  "You had the regular spin 714 not the plus, this model just came out in December. .but as I said about the keyboard it's not great, so I can see how it got stuck lol\n\nBest buy has the most offensive trade in numbers in the game lol",
  "mine when I bought it didnt say Plus on it but as soon as it got its update it was labeled plus.",
  "it was specked the same so they made it a plus.",
  "Looking to buy new laptop under 1200 USD Hey Everyone,\n\nTLDR - \n\nLooking to Buy a reliable professional-grade laptop around 300,000 PKR with strong CPU performance, expandable RAM and SSD options, a capable GPU for rendering, decoding, and solid build quality. Preferably new with local warranty support.\n\nAny recommendations or feedback would be highly appreciated.\n\n\\------------------\n\n# Back Story\n\nAfter a long while, I have finally decided to upgrade my laptop, but the current market dynamics is too confusing for me right now esp. between currency hit, price differences, open-box deals, and Masked/refurbished options, it has been difficult to decide on a laptop that truly fits my needs. I would really appreciate some input from the community.\n\n# Current Setup\n\nI’m currently using an HP ProBook 450 G5 (8th Gen). It has served me well, but it’s beginning to show its age, especially under heavier workloads.\n\n# Requirements\n\nCore Specifications\n\nCondition: Brand new preferred  \nCPU: Intel i7 (H-series or equivalent or better)  \nRAM: 24 GB (16 GB minimum with expansion slot - no soldered ones)  \nStorage - (Must be SSD + HDD option)\n\n* SSD 512 GB for OS (second slot for future expansion is a plus)\n* HDD SATA 1 TB (2.5” inch)\n\nDisplay: At least IPS with decent color accuracy & brightness  \nGPU: Nvidia RTX Ada series or something slightly stronger for rendering, encoding/decoding performance. I can work with gaming series but no older than 4000 series.  \n  \nPorts and Connectivity\n\n* Multiple USB A/B/C 2.0/3.0 ports for accessories (mouse, external drives, cooling stand)\n* 3.5 mm audio jack\n* VGA/HDMI port for external display\n* RJ45 LAN port\n* Wi-Fi 4/5 GHz support\n\nKeyboard and Build\n\n* Full-size backlit keyboard (numpad preferred)\n* Rigid build with minimal flex or hinge wobble. Weight isnt an issue.\n* Easy to open for cleaning or upgrades\n* Local parts availability for future maintenance\n\n# Usage Pattern\n\n* My workload involves heavy office use with constant multitasking, often running numerous browser tabs alongside background tools for downloading and file-syncing. Current system starts to lag with ram & cpu reaching max capacity before apps start crashing.\n* I do not play games on the laptop as I have a ps5 pro for that - so I dont require top end latest GPU.\n\n# Not Considering\n\n* MacBooks, due to hardware/software compatibility issues with some custom tools I use.\n* Touchscreen, 2-in-1, tablets, flipbooks or hand-held devices\n* Desktops, as I often work from multiple client offices and need portability\n\n# Current Thoughts\n\n* I’ve been considering Lenovo ThinkPad T or P Series, but many models seem to use TFT panels by default. \n* HP Victus models have good specifications but poor reviews regarding build quality, screen wobble, and keyboard flex. \n* I’m also uncertain about Intel versus Ryzen options and would appreciate insights on that. \n* My goal is to move to at least an IPS panel, since my current laptop has a TFT. OLED would be ideal, but likely beyond budget.\n\n# Budget: \n\nAround 300,000 PKR\n\n# Important Points\n\n* Models that offer the best balance of performance, portability, display & build quality\n* I would prefer numpad on keyboard but if laptop model is worth it then I can compromise as a trade off.\n\nI know I might be asking for a lot, but any advice or recommendations would really help. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to share their thoughts.",
  "Thinking of Upgrading to HP OmniBook X (Snapdragon X Plus) – Advice Needed! Hi laptop community,\n\nThis is my first post in this community and I could really use your advice!\n\nI’m considering an upgrade and need some advice, especially from those who’ve used the new HP OmniBook X with the Snapdragon X Plus. There’s a deal going on at [Officeworks ](https://www.officeworks.com.au/shop/officeworks/p/hp-14-omnibook-x-snapdragon-x-plus-16-512gb-copilot-pc-hpfe1000qu)in Australia right now for this laptop.\n\n**Current situation:**  \nMy Lenovo Yoga 7 Slim Carbon 13\" (Intel i5-1135G7, 8GB RAM, 257GB SSD) is showing its age. Here are my main problems:\n\n* *Small SSD:* I regularly download and watch movies, but 257GB fills up fast.\n* *Slow performance:* The i5-11th gen feels outdated and sluggish.\n* *Low RAM:* 8GB isn’t enough for my workflow—I keep many job application tabs open and learn coding.\n* *Poor battery life* and unreliable keyboard (some keys need to be pressed VERY hard).\n* *Noise:* The single fan runs constantly and isn’t quiet.\n* After this experience, I’m pretty much done with Lenovo.\n\n**Why I’m considering the HP OmniBook X** Snapdragon X Plus\\*\\*:\\*\\*\n\n* It’s got a Snapdragon X Plus chip, which from what I’ve read should be super snappy and efficient (ARM chips = long battery life).\n* 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD solve my speed and storage issues.\n* Slick design and solid build quality—I’ve only heard good things about HP from friends and Officeworks reviews seem positive.\n* Hoping for much better battery life and a quieter, cooler experience.\n\n**My usage:**\n\n* Watching YouTube/movies\n* Learning coding and applying for jobs\n* Lots of browser tabs (mainly job portals)\n* Want a laptop that’s quiet, with solid battery, good keyboard, and enough power for everyday multitasking.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* How’s real-world performance on ARM Windows laptops? Any compatibility issues for daily use?\n* Is battery life genuinely as good as advertised?\n* What’s your experience with HP build quality and support?\n* Should I consider anything else before making the switch?\n\nAll thoughts, insights, and experiences are very welcome. Thanks in advance for the help!\n\n\\-------------------------  \nUsed perplexity to organize, gather my thoughts and create this post\n\n[HP OmniBook X Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus](https://preview.redd.it/jqkb1usvyzhf1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd6d40bd0a6a248242d1a0fc11db0186f4ba031c)\n\n",
  "These ARM chips are indeed super snappy - as you described. However, if you plan on gaming, I would steer clear as many games are simply not available yet.\n\nIf you don’t game, or know your games work, I would highly recommend. But check everything is compatible, or at the very least, will work via Prism.\n\nI personally have been daily driving a Snapdragon X Elite (but MS Surface) since November and absolutely love it. About 90 - 95% of apps I’ve come across have worked (I’ve tested hundreds for my job). The only ones that have problems are driver related (such as printers). But even then, many print vendors are supporting ARM now. \n\nIn terms of battery life and thermals - they’re sublime. It never gets hot and I’ve never heard the fan spin up (even while working in bed!). Battery lasts 8-10 hours I’m and I have to charge it roughly one every day and a half.\n\nSummary: for a work daily driver, I wouldn’t go back to x64-x86. Hopefully Microsoft can keep up the momentum.",
  "Personally ARM on microsoft is still not where it needs to be. Be prepared to get random compiling errors when coding if the VSC plugin even works to begin with.\n\nFun fact, when these snapdragon chips launched, the windows arm version of chrome just didnt work for two weeks. It was broken and you were relying on a third party vendor (google) to fix their shit.\n\nIf you want an arm device, mac is where it is. If you want x86 linux is where it is. If you want to game, windows is where it is.\n\nWindows on ARM is you running beta testing for software, firmware and hardware while paying for the privilege.\n\nAs for your current device, honestly the big hold back would be the ram. It likely is not enough so you are having to use the page file on your ssd which is slower and if you are running out of space on your ssd it would be even slower. Additionally it is likely not dual channel memory so it is kneecapping the processor's performance. In terms of the fan you could redo the thermal paste yeah that likely is not really fixable.",
  "Did you get omnibook x? Planning to get this one too",
  "Thanks so much for the detailed insight!   \nYour real world experience with snap is helpful, I’m not a gamer, so that side effect isn’t a big issue for me, but I’ll definitely double-check the specific software I need (i use vs code and someone mentioned not all plugins are compatible), and look into Prism compatibility.  \n\n\nI went to Officeworks the other day to try out the laptop, and I was impressed with its sleek aluminium build. The keyboard felt a bit odd to the touch, but that’s fine since I’ll be using an external keyboard anyway. I opened around 30 tabs—YouTube, Reddit, news sites, job portals—and there was a slight lag (which I expected), but it didn’t heat up and the fans never kicked in, which was nice!\n\nThe only letdown was the touchpad. It felt premium, but it didn’t always register my single-tap clicks, which got a bit frustrating. Still, I’ll be using an external mouse most of the time, so it’s not a dealbreaker for me.",

  "Buying a laptop and really at a loss **Background:** I previously had a Lenovo Ideapad 5 which was great until the display failed on me within 8 months. After a botched Lenovo repair and much complaining I finally got it back and then it developed another range of faults in the second year and Lenovo said it was too expensive to repair and handed me back my money. I was pretty surprised that Lenovo said the issues weren't 'economical to repair' and that put me back on the laptop market.\n\nAfter much research, I decided to give Lenovo another try. I heard the Thinkpad range was superior to the cheaper Ideapad so I waited for the latest Gen, bought a great spec T16 (32GB RAM, the best processor option for AMD, 500 nit screen) etc. The computer was expensive and honestly more than I really imagined spending but I was told it's a quality product and I had to increase my budget. I've been using the computer a few weeks and can appreciate the keyboard, display and general build quality. But the computer isn't perfect and i've noticed a few issues which make me hesitant to go down the repair route with Lenovo for a second time so early into ownership. There's a lot I like about this computer but I think the sensible choice is to return it and not touch Lenovo again given previous experience.\n\nSo i'm back in the market and really at a loss what to buy. The criteria is: windows based, 15.6 or 16 inch display, I have a 4k monitor I occasionally hook it up to and would like it to display 3840 x 2160. I'm not a gamer and my coding is not currently at a level where I need a supercomputer. A num pad would be nice. **Display:** I would like to avoid glossy displays and ideally have a 100% sRGB flicker free display. I'm also not convinced about OLED based on reliability and flicker. I just want something which isn't going to break on me within a year. Ideally <£1500.\n\n**HP Elitebook 860 G11**\n\nThis is probably the frontrunner. I use an Elitebook x360 for work. I know the build quality and keyboard is good. However, the computer can run pretty hot and become noisy. Battery life is a bit mediocre and the glossy screen sucks.\n\nI could get the Elitebook 860 G11 with a non-glossy 100%sRGB display and make sure I don't buy a Sure View panel as i've read bad things about it. The spec seems alright for my general needs. However, **are Elitebooks garbage?** HP hasn't always got the best rep and people complain. Saying that, here's me returning a 'solid' Thinkpad as i'm not convinced Lenovo is such great quality.\n\n**Dell**\n\nI hear Dell products have gone a bit downhill. The Latitude 7650 ticks some boxes but now seems pretty expensive. I could look at the cheaper Inspiron (or whatever they call their range). The XPS is pricey and i've seen some negative ownership reviews + I remember they really do run hot.\n\n**Acer / Asus / Samsung (something else)**\n\nI'm willing to consider one of these - maybe the Vivobook 16? I used to have Samsung computers which I quite enjoyed. Build quality was a bit questionable and it seems the Book range has become pricey. \n\nAppreciate any suggestions for laptops and specifically on HP! ",
  "HP consumer class is dogshit, business class is amazing.\n\nDell is shit, in both.\n\nAcer isn't great, ASUS is okay, Samsung is alright, Dynabook is okay, Fujitsu is great like really good, Gigabyte I never used so no idea.",

  "So you reckon I should be alright with the Elitebook? Is it worth paying extra to get 3 years warranty? 1 year did seem a bit stingy compared to Lenovo which chucked in 3 years. Maybe it's a waste of money but could be something useful to have? \n\nI have heard good things about Fujitsu although don't seem to be widely available online. Which makes me hesitant in case I ever need to use the warranty.",
  "Thanks for the suggestions which I will have a look into. zbook Fury (zbook range) probably a bit over my budget. Firefly is a possibility - I remember looking at it initially although thought maybe sacrifices are made to have it lighter / thinner vs something else for same price. \n\nSome of the Dell suggestions are discontinued, maybe you are suggesting used. XPS is pricey but i'll have a look around.",
  "Personally, I always void the warranty as soon as I receive the device. I have absolutely no idea if 3 years warranty is worth it to you or not.",
  "for the best allrounders, used options are the best ull get for <$1500",
  "I didn't think so until lately. If I'm spending a bunch of money on a device then maybe it makes some sense. Some people are happy with buying tech where they think of it as 'disposable' and expect to replace it within a few years. Whereas I hope to get 5+ years out of it. Still using a 12 year old Samsung!",
  "I'm sure that's the case. Just worried about buying a lemon and not having a warranty to fall back on.",

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Pls help me choose laptop :3 HI guys! So im looking for laptop for only studying/ working and my girlie staff like binging netflix series at night... so it doesnt need to be super powerfull but it should be compact. I would love a device that would last me for years. I narrowed it down to these 2 options which seems to suit my needs best:\n\n1. Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Ryzen 5 7535HS/32GB/512+1TB/Win11P \n\n2. ASUS ZenBook 14 UM3406KA Ryzen AI 7 350/16GB/1TB/W11P OLED 120Hz.\n\nThey both seem to be nice and well enough for my needs as im not gaming on laptop (rather use Playstation). The price diffrence between them is not as important to me as choosing one that would be a more solid option and would last at least 5 years :3. The main diffrence between them seems to be the processor: ryzen 5 7535HS (lenovo) vs ryzen AI 7 (ASUS). Also the ASUS has OLED and I can see it is well reviewed but I'm not sure I need it as much as I am not a laptop-playing kind of girl. Also I read that there may by some technical problems with OLED such as burning in and I really cant afford service :p and thats why I am looking for something reliable and for years. \n\nI would love and appreciate any piece of advice <3 Thanksssss",
  "I would go for Asus Zenbook. It has more powerful CPU as well as OLED display - these displays usually have higher brightness and wider color gamut.",
  "I really don’t like my Zenbook, I would recommend a 100-200€ eBay lenovo or the like and a pack of cute stickers to put on it, it’s cheaper, the keyboards feel better, and they’re very unlikely to break or have issues. Modern luxury laptops are usually unrepairable, unreasonably expensive, and have bad performance compared to super loud and hot gaming laptops of the same price. If all you’re looking to do is watch movies you could buy 10 eBay laptops to do it on for the price of one modern expensive one.",

  "First impression of the ASUS ZenBook S 14 258V (Lunar Lake) I received my S 14 about 24 hours ago and have been testing various features. While this isn't a comprehensive review, I hope it might be helpful to some.\n\n* **Processor:** Intel Core Ultra 7 258V 4 x 2.2 - 4.8 GHz, 37 W PL2 / Short Burst, 17 W PL1 / Sustained, Lunar Lake\n* **Graphics adapter**: Intel Arc Graphics 140V\n* **Memory**: 32 GB, LPDDR5x-8533, Dual-Channel\n* **Display**: 14 inches 16:10, 2880 x 1800 pixel 243 PPI, ATNA40CU09-0, OLED, glossy, HDR, 120 Hz\n* **Weight**: 1.179 kg\n\nThe build quality is impressive. The device looks sleek, super thin, and relatively light.\n\nThe display is excellent, though as someone who's seen and owned many OLEDs, I wish it were matte like the new Tab S10. Nonetheless, it's a really good screen. The touchscreen is a nice addition, but in my opinion, it would be better if the display could be laid flat. Everything runs smoothly at 120Hz, and it supports VRR.\n\nThe trackpad is one of the best mechanical ones I've used. While it doesn't compare to haptic trackpads, it's still very good.\n\nThe speakers are surprisingly good for a laptop this size. They caught me off guard with their quality.\n\nThe keyboard is decent, though I wish the keys had more travel. That's what happens when you've tried a ThinkPad keyboard – everything else falls short.\n\nI didn't buy it for gaming, but I tested Fortnite, and it played well. I also experimented with XeSS, which provided a good experience. But I'm not really a gamer, I play light games like Vampire Survivors, AoEIIHD, Mini Motorways, etc.\n\nOverall performance is okay, but not as snappy as Snapdragon-powered laptops. The multicore performance, in my opinion, is almost ridiculously low. Compared to an iPad M4, X Elite / X Plus, or M3 MacBook, it feels like it's lacking some power. This is hard to describe, and I'm used to high-end devices (my workstation has a 7950x, I have an M3 MBP from work, I've had a P14s with an 8840hs, etc), so maybe I'm just too demanding. However, my overall feeling is that it can easily become sluggish.\n\nIt's also quite loud, which is my biggest disappointment. I thought it'd be silent for web browsing and such. While typing this with only Obsidian and Edge open, the fan is spinning. The CPU temperature is around 45-50°C, drawing about 5W. I'm on \"Best Performance\" mode since the laptop is plugged in, but for less than 5W of CPU power, the fan activity seems excessive. Perhaps the chassis isn't great at dissipating heat. It's annoying, especially when any ARM device would be completely silent under these conditions.\n\nThe laptop wakes up almost instantly from sleep, but not quite as fast as ARM devices. Battery life seems better than typical Intel laptops, likely due to Intel's architecture optimization and fewer cores (and low performance). However, based on my brief testing, I don't think it'll match the battery life of X Elite / X Plus devices (SP11, Slim 7x, PZ13). The battery drained about 4% in 10.5 hours, which seems high compared to my PZ13, which only drained 1% in the same period.\n\nMy conclusion: If you need to use an x86-only app that doesn't emulate well, play games that don't run on ARM, want good battery life without needing much power, or don't believe in ARM's future in the PC world, this might work for you. The device is great. Lunar Lake is... a mixed experience. Otherwise, I'd recommend sticking with ARM. I think x86 in thin and light devices may be approaching its end.",
  "I thought battery life on lunar lake vs arm chips were relatively the same? And if not better than the snapdragon chips?",
  "One month update: \n\nThis is the best x86 portable device I've owned by far. It is mostly quiet when on Balanced or Power Saving. I was initially worried about the noise, but I guess \"Best performance mode\" was overkill anyway to browser the web, so my bad :) Again, not as snappy as ARM, but as good as it gets with x86 for a thin & light laptop. Battery life has been nothing short of amazing for my casual use. The overall package is really good on this device. Only con is that it's pretty expensive, but at least it comes with 32GB/1TB, not 16GB/512GB like the M4 MBP at the same price (but M4 should perform much MUCH better, and last much longer, but no OLED, no touchscreen, no upgradable storage, no WiFi7, etc).",
  "Want to buy a zenbook 15, doesnt asus have a setting that you can make the fan run slower ? doesnt that help with fan sound?",
  "Thanks for your review! I've been holding out as long as possible to replace my 2016 windows laptop. Wanted to see how lunar lake did in comparison to snapdragon. Kind of disappointed to hear that that its noticeably less powerful. I talked to a guy at microcenter who said they were getting a lot of returns on the ARM laptops because of the incompatibility.",
  "thanks for the review!   \namazed to understand it feels less snappy than the ARM variants.   \nalso i understand there is a serious performance drop while on battery?\n\ni think they should have put this weak cpu in extreme ultra portables like the surface or very thin and light devices. seems its not a buff enough for more than that?",
  "Hi OP, how about the wireless (wifi and BT) connections reliability ? \n\nI mean, i read that some user of ryzen ai based zenbook have issues with wireless connections reliability (probably because of mediatec chip ?).\n\nI'm still considering to get zenbook lunar lake or ryzen ai, still researching now",
  "So how is the screen outdoors ive heard people call it a black mirror is that true?",
  "could you let me know if this laptop charges above 65 watts? the charger it comes with is 65 but i’m curious if more works.",
  "Snapdragons are snappy until they aren’t compatible with native programs, then snapdragon becomes slow, clunky, and frozen. There are simply too many things still using non native arm for a snapdragon to truely replace a traditional laptop. At least for me. It makes me sad 😢",
  "When you talk about snappiness do you mean ARM is generally better than x86 or just better than 258v? Also which ARM CPUs are we talking in comparison to? Apple or Snapdragon chips?",
  "Thanks for the update. Thinking of getting one - does it get warm (at the bottom of the chassis) when on Balanced/Whisper mode? And how is the battery life comparing to the M3 MBP (I have the M1 MBP, hence the question)",
  "Yeah, that's right, there's a whisper mode. Right now I'm unplugged, the whole thing is draining \\~4w-5w, the CPU drains 1w-2w, CPU temp is 38. That's pretty good for sure, but it's also even more limited in performance in this mode. For $2500 CAD, that's a lot to ask for such limited performance.",
  "I'm also looking to upgrade (from a 2011 Gateway laptop), and as of right now it seems like Macbooks are the way to go if you don't care about Windows or gaming, Lunar Lake for thin and light general use (still waiting for more devices), and AMD for heavier use.\n\nThe reality is that Windows on ARM is just not 100% there yet. If it runs the software you need, it works great. But if it doesn't, it's basically useless. That's why you get OP singing praises about Snapdragon laptops and how x86 is dying, and the Microcenter guy saying people are returning them.\n\nAs an example, Snapdragon laptops can't even run Ableton Live in emulation mode, so it's a no-go for me. I really don't want to bother looking up the compatibility for all my software (and even if it runs in emulation, there's going to be a performance or battery penalty).",
  "No performance drop on battery AFAIK",
  "Zero issue with Wifi and BT",
  "It's glossy but it's as good or as bad as any other laptop IMO 🤷🏻",
  "65 max. The battery isn't that big tbh and 65 is more than enough for quick top-ups",
  ">When you talk about snappiness do you mean ARM is generally better than x86 or just better than 258v?\n\nThat X Plus / X Elite are snappier than X86. 258V is close, but ARM is still snappier. It adds up after hours of small really quick interactions.\n\n>Also which ARM CPUs are we talking in comparison to? Apple or Snapdragon chips?\n\nSpecifically, Snapdragon since we're talking PCs. But ARM in generally snappier since the instructions are less complex (thus require less time to execute).",
  "we're you able to get one with an English keyboard?",
  "💯\n\nWindows on ARM is great until your good patience is reached, eg: I can't print double sided on my brother printer, why? No drivers for ASIO, and I know focusrite will take forever to release their, if they ever do. It piles up really quickly, and these devices aren't cheap. So it's a matter of what you're willing to compromise the most... battery life? performances? compatibility? price?\n\nBattery life: ARM or Intel\nPerformances: AMD or ARM\nCompatibility: AMD or Intel\nPrice: previous gen AMD/Intel\n\nLunar Lake is a good balance, but it still lacks what ARM offers on battery life, perf per watt and features like instant wake up/no battery drain on sleep. But it runs everything, just a bit slower at time.\n\nIt's not easy 😅\n\nAnd then you have MacBooks that just do it all. 🙃 Okay except gaming but I personally don't care about it so",
  "I am also planning to replace my current laptop but currently holding it out as long as the current one works because I am confused whether to go with arm, lunar lake or macbook air. \n\nHopefully within next one year, it will be clear, but I am more and more leaning towards MBA",
  "Thanks...now i'm choosing between asus or lenovo",
  "I would really appreciate if you could send me afew pics showcasing the glare on the screen 🙏",
  "Any issues with outside use? Is it completely unusable or just worst?",
  "Thanks for the info. Looks like Lunar chips are good if you want to go with compatibility and somewhat improvement on power efficiency but not as optimized as snapdragon chips with that gives more snappy experience. AMD strix on the other hand consume more power and would probably need a big chassis to keep things cool.",
  "Yes only the labels are bilingual [https://i.imgur.com/vKb4n3B.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/vKb4n3B.jpeg)",
  "Purchased yoga x elite three weeks ago. I opted for snapdragon over macbook bc better repair-ability. I see a lot of people over-look this point when they compare windows vs apple.

  "Hard time choosing a new laptop. So I currently am using a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, and am planning on upgrading because: A) It is not powerful enough, and B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nI am a student and will primarily be using the laptop for school work, so it needs to be portable and a comfortable weight to bring with me to and from class. I love how portable my 13\" Air is. I've done a LOT of research over the past two years, but never bit the bullet, but I feel like now is the time, and so I've committed to buying one now.\n\nMy use cases (in order of importance): School, Music Production, Photoshop, Gaming\n\nI don't play a lot of games but it would be nice to have a machine to play some Civ 6 or even some other, more intensive games like BO2/BO3 Zombies (and MAYBEEEE some RDR2) when I am on a plane for a long time. I want something that's decent on battery life, I don't spend all day at school, maybe 4 hours at most on a given day, so I want something that'll last me that long doing just school work without having to even worry about bringing a charger.\n\nNow, I've looked at like tens of laptops, from gaming to notebook, and I've seen some I've considered like the Zenbook S16, Lenovo Slim 7i Aura, Zenbook 14, Zenbook A14, but I've narrowed it down to a couple:\n\nZephyrus G14/G16 - The clear winner for me, problem is it is just too expensive, and the only models that go on sale into my price range are the 4050 G14 and 4060 G16 models which I've heard may not be worth it. They don't go on sale super often, and the ones that do are open box. (Currently can get the 4050 model for $1499 CAD open box)\n\nZenbook Duo 2024 (Ultra 9, 32GB, 1TB, 60hz 1080p model) - I've toyed with the idea of having this laptop for a while. My PC setup at home has 3 monitors and I absolutely love it, and could see myself getting genuine use out of both screens when writing an assignment, key word being WHEN I am doing an assignment, which isn't an every day thing. I don't think it would be powerful enough to handle any gaming at all. Surprisingly, this is actually cheaper than both the G14 and G16 Models I would be getting. (Currently can get it Refurb-Excellent for $1519 CAD)\n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 15\" - This just came out, and I feel like 15\" is the perfect size for me to be honest. I can get the spec with the Ryzen 7 260, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD (will add another in the future), and a 5060 8GB card for within my price range, around $1750 all in. It's around 4 pounds which is the heaviest of the three, but is also the fastest of the three. It's so new that there isn't a single review yet for it. (Brand new for $1750 CAD, could try and haggle it at Lenovo)\n\nThese are my three ideas right now in terms of what to get. Does anyone have any recommendations? Anyone with these laptops have advice?\n\nI'd not like to spend more than $2000 CAD.\n\nEDIT: In case it wasn't clear, this is not meant to be a desktop replacement; I already have one.",
  "Well you need to be aware of the fact that most gaming laptops have a dedicated gpu they are loud heavy and the battery life is 3hours at best and the performance is ass when on battery .\nSo you’ll want something with a powerful igpu like a Ryzen ai 300 series (the Ryzen 7 or 9 models) or the intel core ultra 200 series ( like the ultra 7 258v) these have the most powerful iGPUs currently available. Also their batter life is pretty good.",
  "Don't buy the Zenbook duo. It's more of a gimmick and not a good choice for your use case. \n\nGaming laptops all suffer from battery life. They always need to be plugged in. They don't last long. \n\nYou might want to get something with a modern AMD Ryzen 8000 series CPU. The integrated graphics are good for some light gaming. These CPU are also power efficient so you get good battery life.\n\nAsus Zenbook S16 and Zenbook 14 should be the models to consider. The models with AMD Ryzen CPUs.",

  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget €2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years. As longevity is important, I believe performance is an important criteria. My current setup is an 8th gen Intel i5 Asus laptop (8/256) and a M4 Mac Mini (24/512) on the desk. I want to replace both of these items with a single Windows laptop and I'll sell the Mac. I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around €2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. €1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. €1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. €1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. €2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. €2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** €2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",
  "Have you ruled out Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024 or 2025)? It is a cheaper Asus ProArt with the same of internals.  These Asus model carry the best speakers of all Windows laptops which is nice to have if you have kids or others to share a screen.",
  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",
  "Question: why are you listing high refresh rate laptops? Is that something you want?\n\nBecause I doubt you’ll max out that refresh rate in games unless you play older games or competitive online games.\n\nEdit: nvm just saw you don’t care about games.",
  "Have you considered a HP ZBook?",
  "T14 Thinkpads",
  "Update: Added the Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) to the list",
  "I did but seems a little difficult to find them not overly priced in Ireland.",
  "I'm doing some research on the P14s this morning.\n\nDirect from Lenovo I can get the Ultra 9 185H, no operating system, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 3K IPS display for €2370.\n\nA local retailer has the Ultra 9 185H, Win 11 Pro, 32GB RAM, 1TB performance SSD, 2560x1600 @ 90Hz display for €1790.\n\nI don't think the better display is worth €600.",
  "Also, unlike the ProArt you don't need to pay for a 4070 you said you wouldn't be using much. The 16:10 screen is also good for web development with it's bit of extra height. P1's are also pretty much the top of the Thinkpad scale, being workstation laptops and thus very solid. P1 gen 7 is also 17mm thick and 2kg so pretty portable.",
  "You're right, I never game but do appreciate a nice smooth screen. High refresh rate is not a must have but more a nice to have.",
  "I will take a look, thanks",

I currently use a DELL G15 gaming laptop, and its a living hell, heat, noise, you name it. Because of my previous bad experience with gaming laptops, I will not be getting a laptop with a dedicated GPU. As of right now, I have found a lot of laptops which meet the requirements of my uni, they are listed below:\n\n[ThinkPad X9 15 Aura Edition Intel (15ʺ)](https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx9/thinkpad-x9-aura-edition-15-inch-intel/21q6cto1wwca1) \\- For this laptop I customized it, I changed the SSD to 256 gigs, since its cheaper, this allows me to buy a ssd and install it for a lot less. I added the touchscreen feature and windows 11 pro, everything else remains the same. The current price of this laptop with all the discounts is $2,230\n\n[Zenbook S 16 (UM5606)](https://shop.asus.com/ca-en/asus-zenbook-s-16-um5606.html) \\- Online reviews aren't very nice to this laptop, multiple reviews online, youtube, blogs, and even reddit state that because of how thin the laptop is it struggles with heat at the at keyboard, and some people say it overheats too. Keeping that in mind, there are A LOT of positive reviews for it too. The current Price of this laptop is $2,200\n\n[MSI Prestige AI 16\"](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/msi-prestige-ai-16-qhd-laptop-stellar-grey-intel-core-ultra-7-evo-edition-2tb-ssd-32gb-ram-win11/17539020) \\- I haven't done any research for this laptop, however it meets the requirements and looks like a good laptop. The laptop is on sale for $1,800\n\n[HP Omnibook 7](https://www.costco.ca/hp-omnibook-7-copilot-pc-173-in-touchscreen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-7-258v-32-gb-ram-1-tb-ssd-intel-arc.product.4000367750.html) \\- This laptop is selling on costco right now for $1,650. I have heard a lot of good things about it, and it seems very modern, it meets the requirements and for the price its really good.\n\n[ HP 15.6-in Laptop, Intel Core Ultra 7 155H - 32 GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Intel Arc](https://www.costco.ca/hp-156-in-laptop-intel-core-ultra-7-155h---32-gb-ram-1tb-ssd-intel-arc.product.4000329837.html) \\- This is another Costco laptop, from the looks of it, it has almost the same cpu, but differs in screen size, and windows copilot and a few other things. Build quality doesn't seem as good. its $1,100\n\n[Acer Aspire Go 15.6-in Laptop, Ryzen 7 5825U– 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD](https://www.costco.ca/acer-aspire-go-156-in-laptop-ryzen-7-5825u-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd.product.4000359623.html) \\- its $800 on SALE right now, but the build quality, screen, everything seems very limited, not to say its a bad laptop but it doesn't seem like its gonna last a long time.\n\nI guess what I need advice on is just knowing what to invest in, since ill be paying for uni through student loans I don't want to spend a lot, but at the same time I will be using this laptop for 4 years, and maybe for work and even for my masters. I just want to get a laptop which will last, has good build quality, and good specs. Having a good screen, a big keypad, etc, is all fun and good, but I'm not sure if its worth an additional $1000 dollars.\n\nI would like to provide a bit for info:\n\nI am going into the tech industry (software dev) but my program requires a few additional courses, in which I will be running VMs, compiling code, etc.\n\nAlso to add onto all of that, I do value a machine that doesn't sound like jet taking off, or is so hot it radiates heat. Battery life matters, weight matters so much, and thickness too!

Canada\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** No\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Form factor doesn't matter much, a traditional laptop is just fine, and so is a 2-in-1. I value build quality, performance, and battery. If I had to rank it, 1. Performance, 2. Battery, 3. Build Quality.\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Very. Since ill be going all over campus, I want the laptop to weigh under 1.5kg, thickness matters, but not so much. If the device is thin, it feels better, weighs less, and its cool as hell. But sometimes its so thin it can ruin the device. So, yeah i prefer the laptop to be thin, but its not required.\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** Above 15\".\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Watching videos, movies, etc. Light gaming, call it roblox, minecraft, etc. For programs I have no idea the programs I will be using in uni, but I do know I will be using VMs (Virtual Machines) and Visual Studio Code.\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**\\-fill here, remove dashes-\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Yes, a good keyboard, and reliable build quality. Touch screen is a gimmick to me, cool to have, not required. Finger-print reader/ windows hello, not required, good to have. A large-ish touchpad. Don't need external mouse or keyboard.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Thank you taking the time to read this, and please lmk if you have any questions, etc.\n\n\\--",

The only \"requirement\" the professors have is that it runs any kind of coding environment (usually VS Code), Python and has at least 16GB memory. \n\nOther than that I use it to write term papers, watch YouTube videos and play visual novels (i. e. games that are not demanding on the graphics card).\n\nMy old laptop was an HP 15-bs1xx, 15.6\" screen, with an Intel i7-8550 processor and an on-board GPU (called UHD 620, I think). I've upgraded it to 16 GB RAM and 1 TB storage.\n\nFriends recommended a gaming laptop, but I think that's not what I need. I have a SteamDeck to play my games, so going that way seems a bit overkill. I'd rather have a notebook that will be ok if it takes an occasional bump (I'm clumsy) and can keep me company for a long time. Still, I want something that can last a while, so my budget is about 1000$.\n\nI've heard that ThinkPads are durable, but I haven't looked into any models yet. Which notebook would you recommend?",
  "Get a [business laptop](https://smbtech.au/features/best-business-laptop/) as they're built to last. The latest [HP ZBook  G1a workstation](https://smbtech.au/reviews/hp-zbook-ultra-g1a-14-australian-laptop-review/) is expensive but perfect for such tasks, too.",
  "* Top-tier laptops: Lenovo ThinkPad T/P-series, HP EliteBook, HP ZBook\n\n* High-tier: Lenovo ThinkBook, Asus Zenbook, Asus ExpertBook",
  "think pad t or p series.  pretty similar, p has dedicated gpu, t doesnt (tho the igpu is pretty decent IME, i own a T16). T usually has better battery life.  Lenovo builds them to milspec standards.",
  "I'd swap the positioning of the EliteBooks and ZBooks (Or bump the ZBooks up) on that tier list and specify T/P-Series ThinkPads instead of just ThinkPads in general. E-Series and to a lesser extent L-Series aren't built to the same level of quality.",
  "HP 840 g9 vs Thinkpad T14 gen5 I'm trying to decide between two laptops:\n\n* **HP EliteBook 840 G9** (i7-1255U)  \\~550€\n* **Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 5** (Intel Core Ultra 7 155U)  \\~700€\n\nThe ThinkPad is more recent and probably has a slightly better CPU. However, some reviews mention that it tends to run a bit warm and can be somewhat noisy.\n\nI'm looking for a quiet, reliable laptop that's upgradable and powerful enough to handle most medium to moderately heavy tasks, including multitasking and some CAD software. Ideally, I’d like something that can last me for the next 10 years, if possible.\n\nDo you think the HP EliteBook 840 G9 would be enough for my needs, or is the ThinkPad worth the extra cost?\n\nIs a Dell Latitude 5450 (Intel Core Ultra 7 165U ) a good option to consider in this price range?",
  "i would look at that dell tbh, latitudes are usually pretty good and its the fastest one here",
  "The Latitude has the best cpu, but how much is it ? That EliteBook is a pretty nice deal tho.\n\nIt’s 7 165U > 7 155U > 1255U.",
  "What laptop should I get? I'm an engineering student who also works in research and coding, and I'm looking for a new laptop. I was currently using my dad's old ThinkPad T450s, and it lasted 8 years and still works smoothly, but the battery life has deteriorated a lo,t and it's just not portable anymore. I'm looking for a new laptop on a more student-friendly budget that would work well with VSCode/Vim, Linux, and VMs. Here are some of my choices:\n\n**ThinkPad E-series 14:**\n\n* Intel Core Ultra 5 125U Processor (E-cores up to 3.60 GHz, P-cores up to 4.30 GHz)\n* 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\n* Windows 11 Home\n* Cost: ₹68.9k\n\nI don't know much about the quality and performance of the ThinkPad E-series, though. Since it has a U-processor, I'm a bit unsure about its performance.\n\n**Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3:**\n\n* 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13620H processor\n* 16GB RAM LPDDR5-4800 | 512GB SSD, expandable up to 1TB\n* Cost: ₹66k\n\nHonestly, the processor seems good, but I've heard negative reviews about the build quality of IdeaPads.\n\n**MacBook Air:**\n\n* Apple M1 chip\n* 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage\n* Cost: ₹59k\n\nAlthough I've heard positive reviews of MacBook Airs from professionals, the storage throws me off a bit, and many people don't recommend them for college.\n\nSome of the other laptops I've considered are Lenovo LOQ and ASUS, but these are my personal top choices. If you guys have any suggestions for any other laptops or experience with any of the laptops listed above, I'd appreciate any advice.",
  "I am also looking at laptops but I can say one thing for sure. **Do not buy a MacBook**, a lot of engineering software is not compatible or doesn't run well. I get that they are attractive in terms of battery life and power but it's just not good for this type of work. \n\n\nI also noticed that intel works a bit better with low level programming and is a bit more stable with Linux. The new intel CPUs are quite nice with battery life and performance. \n\nFrom the laptops that you provided I would get the ThinkPad with intel 5 125U, the performance is alright, I am using a Ryzen 5 5600H and this intel is better in every way. The build quality on ThinkPad was always ok, the E series are a budget friendly for people that can't buy a T series or X1.\n\nEdit: the CPU in the IdeaPad is going to be a bit more powerful in computing but the integrated graphics are way worse and the power efficiency is also worse, so I guess if you value battery life and graphics, the ultra is the obvious choice.",
  "I'm considering a thinkpad with ryzen 7 since it's also budget friendly. Def not considering a macbook anymore. Thanks for the advice",
  "Need help choosing a laptop for grad school Ok, Reddit, I need help. TLDR: trying to decide between a single expensive computer with 2 screens, or one of 3 laptops with a color E-ink tablet. Links for all included.\n\nI know very little about computers, but I need a laptop for graduate school. It's online, so all of my textbooks are digital. I get wicked eye pain and migraines when using computers and my cellphone screens for too long, so I also need an E-ink tablet or display for reading. I'm currently using my sister's Microsoft Surface with 16gb RAM and 1TB SSD storage, and it works fast enough for me, so I've narrowed my choices down a bit based on that.\n\nI was going to get this one: \n https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkbook/thinkbook-plus/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-4-13-inch-intel/21jj0003us\n\nThis Lenovo ThinkBook Pro Generation 4 with both an OLED and E-ink screens (and I may still end up going that route), but there are a few detractors. 1) the price: even though it's originally almost $4k, $1,400+ is a lot to spend on a single device that only had 16 gb RAM, and that price doesn't include any extended warranty. 2) If it needs servicing, I'm out both my computer AND my textbook reader until it's fixed, and 3) I need a backlit keyboard. \n\n(My partner is gone 10-12 hours every weekday at work and goes to bed rather early, so we don't get a lot of time together. I have started working on papers and research in bed next to him at night and he just falls asleep while I'm working. He can sleep through pretty much ANYTHING - we joke that he had semi-voluntary narcolepsy! - but I don't want to have to keep the light on in order to do my work. So, backlit keyboard.)\n\nThe other choices I've narrowed down are as follows: \n\nhttps://a.co/d/iUbMkvb\nIt's HP, which I've had before and been somewhat unimpressed with (it wasn't a bad computer, it just didn't wow me), but being a major brand name, I figure if it needs servicing, it will be easier to get done. No backlit keyboard, though.\n\nhttps://a.co/d/ec0KPAQ\nThis is a brand I've never heard of, Rumtuk, but I found a couple reviews online that showed it worked well, even a year later. It's one of the only ones I found with a backlit keyboard in my preferred price range (less than $500 before the protection plan). I'm wary of getting an unknown brand, though (I would get the extended warranty, but if it breaks within the manufacturer's warranty, I'm screwed)\n\nhttps://a.co/d/eEHorDt\nThis is another Lenovo with twice the RAM for not much more price. I'm not a big fan of half the storage being on the cloud, and no backlit keyboard.\n\nAny of these 3 will be paired with a color E-ink tablet, which I'm also still trying to decide on. \n\nHelp me, laptop subreddit! You're my only hope! ",
  "Any thoughts on the new HP EliteBook 8 Flip G1i? The newest generation of HP EliteBook laptops is getting a rebrand. The successor of the Elitebook 830 seems to be the EliteBook 8.

  "Student Laptop Recommendations. With graduation coming soon, I've decided to figure out what laptop I'm going to buy for college. \n\nAfter posting a very similar question in r/Mac the other day, I was gently steered towards thinking about a windows computer - more on why later. \n\nAnyways, I'll put some info about my preferences, and then some of the major contenders I've found so far. \n\nI would really appreciate any suggestions, or feedback on the laptops I've narrowed my search to. \n\nMy Use Case: \nI am planning to major in finance. This is a huge reason I've been steered away from Macs. I love Macs and have used them all my life, but the excel compatibility seems like a dealbreaker. Outside of basic stuff such as excel, word etc. I plan on doing light to moderate gaming, and lots of general browsing and streaming. Nothing crazy intensive though.\n\nI should note I talked to my school - I *could* get through the finance program using a Mac, but it would be a pain. \n\nWhat I value: \nThe most important thing for me in a laptop is that it should be superb build quality, and have great longevity. I'm ok with paying a bit of a premium for those things. I prefer sleek minimalist designs, and often find \"boring\" designs tbe most attractive. After that, i would like it to be snappy, and handle daily tasks with ease. Doesn't need to be a powerhouse but i never want to notice it running slow doing mundane tasks. Lastly, I want this to feel at least somewhat premium as far as my touchpad and keyboard. I would especially prefer haptic touchpad \n\n\nSome options im considering:\n\nApple MacBook Air(M3) - as much as I've been steered away from it, a small part of me still wants one. This one is almost out of the picture though\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X9 14 aura - I really like this one. I think it's come as close as any I've found to meeting my needs from what I've seen. The only issue is price. The very lowest configuration I'd feel comfortable buying is around 1400 on Lenovos website, and sadly I don't have time to wait for sales as I need to get this ASAP so I can get familiar with windows OS. That 1400 is stretching my price range a lot further than I was hoping to go.\n\nWindows surface 7 - This comes in a close second to the ThinkPad. I LOVE the design, and the build quality seem amazing as well. I love basically everything about it... except the ARM. I've looked at my schools software requirements and I can't find anything specific that doesn't run on ARM, but It makes me nervous and the lack of gaming is also a bit of annoyance to me\n \nLenovo Slim 7i 14 aura - this guy is really compelling to me in the value department, and does almost everything I want really well. As stupid as it sounds, it really bothers me that there's no haptic trackpad, and I've seen some review say that the display and build quality are a little lacking, especially compared to some of the other laptops I'm considering \n\n\nAny insights are greatly, greatly appreciated. Please yell at me if I'm overthinking something, let me know which of the laptops above you'd recommend, or bonus points if you give me a different recommendation. Thanks!"
