  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

  "Please help me decide if I should stick with mac or try the Lenovo Yoga Currently running a mbp from early 2015. It's been running perfectly, and I'm almost certain I haven't had a error message in the soon 10 years I've had it.\nBeen thinking about buying the mba m3 16/512 on the black Friday sales. \n\nBut I'm seeing the reviews of the Yoga slim 7x, not to talk about the the specs, with doubled the ram, storage etc.\nEarlier this year I bought a Lenovo Legion 5 pro i9, which I swiftly returned. I realised the added benefits of a laptop that could do everything wasn't worth the sacrifice of long battery, running silent, good sound from the speakers etc.\nThis obv. Isn't a issue with the yoga.\nSoftware wise I had some issues within the first few days. Error messages, windows asking me to install a driver but Lenovo software asking me if I was sure because it would deactive something. I hated the bloatware and didn't like how some settings was in Windows but I needed to look at \"Lenovo Vantage for other settings. That's atleast how I remember it.\nBut it's just.. I would prolly get used to windows again, and it's impossible to not ignore the beauty and specs of machine.\n\nSome factors: \nI don't care about touch screen.\nSoundquality is important\nStability, ease of use and safety is important.\nSome light gaming is somewhat important. I really wanna play Hearts of Iron 4.\n\nOther than that, I do some light video editing and sound mixing, often got tons of tabs open.\n\nI think it's FOMO, and that even if the yoga on some areas blow the Mac out of the water, the Mac is more fitting for my use, but I just wanna hear some perspectives.\n\nThanks in advance ",
  "I have two laptops: a maxed out Lenovo Legion Pro 7i intel i9 14900 RTX 4090 and the lowest spec MacBook Air M1 8GB RAM 256 GB SSD. I need the Lenovo for work, because I need Linux and cuda. However, for mail, web browsing, content consumptions, the MacBook is simply perfect.\n\nMy bottom spec MBA M1 smokes the latest intel MacBook (2019 or 2020 iirc). So I am pretty sure MBA/MBP M3 will impress you if you are coming from 2015 MacBook. If gaming is not a make or break factor, I'd always go with a MacBook.",
  "Lenovo Yoga.",
  "Do you mind expanding on that?",
  "Is this a good laptop? Looking to buy a laptop to use for Unity, Substance painter/ photoshop/ Blender, video editing and VR Gaming. Is this good enough?",
  "No such thing as a bad product. Just a bad price",
  "That looks great, I’ve seen this before and it should upgrade up to 32 GB ram.",
  "Bad display. If you can live with that, it’s good value.",
  "I believe its on sale for 800$\nIs it good for that price?",
  "Not terrible but I would look for a 2560x1600 display for a 16\" laptop",
  "I dont mind the fhd display, but how is the color accuracy \n\nI would be using it mainly for gaming, 3d modeling, and video editing",
  "I would go OLED then. I wouldn't book on any laptop in that price range to have stellar color accuracy but something like this would be really good: https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sku/6548317.p?skuId=6548317",
  "so would the one in your link be a better option for 3d modeling, adobe software, and VR gaming?",
  "Definitely. It has much higher end hardware too. You might want to upgrade the RAM though. Check if it is soldered or not. Also, what VR headset do you have? This laptop doesn't have DisplayPort.",
  "USB Type-C to connect the headset",
  "Then you should be good. Definitely upgrade to 32 or 64GB of RAM though",

  "Is this laptop good for video editing? Hello reddit, my girlfriend is looking for a good laptop to use for video editting. I have been looking around but dont know much about computers. Shes asked for my help and this is what I came up with. What do you guys think? Also a link to the website where I found it (dutch): https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1963276/lenovo-legion-slim-5-16aph8-82y9008nmh/specificaties/",
  "It depends what kind of video editing, 4K, 6K, 8K, which app you're using (Adobe cloud, Davinci Resolve), how many layers, effects, etc. It should be good enough to edit 4k even 6k footage. From what I can see, this one has Ryzen 7 7840HS which should be enough for Adobe Cloud apps as they are more CPU oriented, as well as rtx 4070 which should help with Davinci Resolve for example, as it is more GPU oriented. For video editing you also want to check color display which should be at least 100% srgb or even better, 100% Adobe srgb or  100% DCI-P3 color gamut. I can't seem to find that for this one from the information you've provided.\n\nGenerally speaking you want to look for Ryzen 7 or 9 from 7 series (you'll see some numbers like \"Ryzen 7 **7**840HS\" or \"Ryzen 9  **7**900HX\". When first number is 7 it means it's from that series). Also from Intel i7 or i9 from 13 series (you'll see some numbers like \"i7 **13**650h\" or \"i9 **13**900\" so when the first number is 13, it means it's from that latest series). For GPU go for rtx4060 (4070 is great btw) or higher. And look for screen colors like i mentioned before. Also, the more RAM, the better. 16 is good, but more is always better (the one you mentioned has expandable memory up to 32GB which is good as you can always add a bit more).\n\np.s. I'm no computer expert but I'm also on the lookout for a video editing laptop and after extensive research, I've opted for Vivobook 15 PRO oled with either i9 13900h CPU or with new Ultra 9 185h CPU, rtx 4060. It has OLED display with  100% DCI-P3 color gamut. And expandable RAM memory as well as thunderbolt 4. Both are at around 1500 euros, so if you want to spend a bit more, those ones I would recommend.\n\nAlso, I've watched this guy's videos  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf6MBfIiTUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf6MBfIiTUs)",
  "It will be overkill for most video editing. I would also look into MacBooks too since they strive in video editing",
  "Thanks this information has been really helpfull!",
  "Would a AMD Ryzen™ 5 7535HS/H paired with rtx 4050 be good enough for video editing? 16gb ram, 100% srgb, 75% adobe srgb. I know these specs are on the low side but i dont have a massive budget and my lappy of 10+ years is slowly but surely giving up the ghost.",
  "I think it should be ok for 1080, 4K though, not sure, probably not the best performance. \n\nCheck out this guy's videos [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf6MBfIiTUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf6MBfIiTUs)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtQMcJFcfiA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtQMcJFcfiA)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5z\\_qtsrnGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5z_qtsrnGs)",

  "Vostro 7510 Review/ Advice Request  \n\nI really appreciated this (and other) reddit when I was searching for a laptop, and wanted to return the favor with a quick review of this laptop. I am not a formal laptop reviewer, and don’t have fancy gizmos to check nits or color accuracy, but wanted to share. I have only been using it for about a day or two, and I may or may not post some updates as I use this more. There’s also some chance that I will return it. \n\nModel: [https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations)\n\n(purchased on sale for $1150 + 10% CB).\n\nI wouldn’t mind some advice from the sub on whether to keep this or return for one of two slightly more gamery computers that will seemingly solve some of the issues I have with this - either the Lenovo Legion 7 Slim or the HP Omen 16.1 AMD (if it gets released on HP’s site soon enough). \n\n**Background:**\n\nI joined a small business and needed a laptop. I purchased my last laptop \\~11 years ago and while it aged gracefully… that's like 85 in laptop years. Business required that the laptop have Windows 10 Pro, and preferred that it have biometric security. I wanted it to be thin, and have good build quality so it will hold up well. I also wanted to be able to play the new AOE when it comes out (i.e., light RTS and 4x type games). Finally, I needed the laptop yesterday so I didn’t have time to wait around for the best deal.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\nI think this laptop falls short in a few ways: (1) it spontaneously shut down the first day I was using it. Enough battery, updated Microsoft drivers, and no indication of why when I turned it back on. Not sure what it was, but I updated the Dell drivers and it hasn't happened again in the few hours of use since that. (2) Battery life could be better, once I was down to less than 40% after about 3 hours of (non-gaming) use (downloading and installing some applications, light browsing). As I type this I have 2:56 estimated remaining at 77% of the battery on “better battery” setting. The battery estimate was also all over the place. I don’t think it’s fair to expect much more out of a 56 whr battery, but I think it is fair to expect more than a 56 whr battery in this kind of laptop. (3) The keyboard is ok - typing feels nice enough, although I liked my old Lenovo’s keyboard a little bit better. The backlighting is a joke. (4) Cooling. I ran Offworld Trading Company, which was free from Epic Games at the time I received this computer, and after less than 15 minutes of play I found the palm rest to be warm, and (using a food thermometer) found the temperature to be over 100 fahrenheit on the speakers, and about 127 fahrenheit right underneath the vents. The fans were noticeably loud as well. Task manager says the GPU got up to 65c. That seemed pretty warm for a few minutes of play on a 5 year old game.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\nThe strengths are in the specs: i7 with a 3050ti, aluminum chassis (there is a very thin plastic bezel around the screen, but it's small enough to get over. Pretty good build quality. Touchpad is spacious. It’s relatively heavy for a 2021 laptop, but it has a dGPU and is pretty thin. Screen is pretty nice and color accurate, although I suspect nothing special in 2021. And I will be able to play aoe4 on this (when it comes out). \n\n**Dell Customer Service:**\n\nI also wanted to call out a good experience with Dell Customer Service. Without getting into the details, they made things right quickly and followed up to make sure things ended up ok. \n\n**Request for Advice:**\n\nWhen I was looking at this I was also between the Lenovo Legion 7 slim which is a few hundred dollars more, but has a higher refresh screen and the 3060. I decided that because I am looking to play RTS/4x games that are typically not AAA graphically intensive, a 3050 would be enough and I would be better saving the money. \n\nI was also considering the new HP Omen AMD 16.1, but it still hasn't been released on HP’s website (where they have frequent 10% off gaming PC sales), and given that I need something now, I may not be able to wait until they can ship it.\n\nNow that I have used the Vostro, and have pointed out the above concerns, do you think I’ll get (a) significantly better battery life on one of those other options, and (b) is the cooling significant enough to cause problems with my use of the Dell?",
  "Just 1 question. Does it have 1 or 2 SO-DIMM memory slots??\n\nOne review said 8GB is soldered. One Dell maintenance manual shows 2.\n\nI'm between this and the 15\" LG Ultra with the GTX 1650 Ti. The Dell has the true full size number pad, but the LG's is the crammed version.  For me this is between soldered ram or not. If 1 is soldered, then I'll have a tough decision. \n\nSo, please pop the back cover and let us know?\n\nThanks!!",
  "I reached out to Dell. They confirmed its 2x SO-DIMM slots that support up to 64GB RAM!",
  "You’ll need to consider whether you want a gaming laptop or not. The Vostro is not a gaming laptop and won’t perform like one. It is a premium build quality well rounded business laptop with top specs. It will get hot when gaming over long periods of time. If you want something with more power you should consider the Lenovo legion slim 7 or if you don’t want a gamery feeling laptop the Ideapad 5 pro 16.",
  "Do you know if it has one or two M.2 SSD slots/what the storage upgrade options are like?",
  "Hi there, have you been able to play AoE4 on it since the release of the game and would you recommend this laptop for this game? I am looking for a decent laptop for everiday tasks, with a moderate price, and not especially oriented for gaming but I would love to be able to run AoE4 (but no other AAA games that are massively demanding on GPU, CPU and memory).",
  "I just got this laptop RTX3050 version, and I have to say, I believe the design around the battery life and cooling system is very poor. I thought mine is broken, after reading similar stories from other owners similar experiences are confirmed. I’m frustrated and disappointed with this product from Dell. The battery needing to be bigger and cooling system larger. IMO it’s flawed heavily. You can’t game on it either, the RTX3050 is very weak. The screen is average. Considered returning it for a different model but I’m too busy at work. \n\nWould not go with a dell laptop again. I could of paid slightly more and got a different manufacturer with better specifications and most likely none of these cooling and battery issues.\n\nSorry Dell, but this product is piss poor.\n\nEdit: ram dota2 as a test, can’t even get more than 30fps avg, 1080p max textures details. My desktop with Radeon RX5700XT and an old 6 core sandy bridgy CPU sits just below 200 avg\n\n30fps avg in an esports game isn’t playable.\n\nEdit2:  it sure what dell were targeting with its design, it can’t go anywhere without its charger very nearby. Poor gaming performance, terrible thermals. That leaves users with an always plugged laptop that only runs word processing applications and runs like a volcano doing it.\n\nEdit3: screen is 60hz. 2021 they release a mid range laptop with this? Dell are you high? Reason I bought it? It was 40% off. I almost got my boss one whilst awaiting shipping. Pretty glad I didn’t get my employer an absolute dud laptop, that seems like dell were trying to offload\n\nEdit4: finally. At work we run all dell emc servers. Lost a lot of faith on dell consumer, and as a whole if they are pulling this kind of crap I n 2021. We are due for a major upgrade, HPE looking much more convincing",

  "I would wonder why the GTX card if not gaming... I mean, the type of computing (ML, linear algebra) I use for work with an Nvidia card is more demanding than gaming.  If it can't handle gaming, then it can't handle a work setting that requires a GPU.  Otherwise, most workers don't need a dedicated GPU for work (with Word, browsing, etc).  Just puzzled, what's the point of providing a GPU that can't handle gaming.",
  "I have one, same specs as OP but regular 3050, not Ti. It has 2x m.2 slots. The OEM ssd is a very short m2 2230 drive. The other M2 slot can take a normal full length SSD. The short OEM 2230 ssd drive is in the longer m2 slot with a weird metal arm to anchor it to the screw down hole at the end. So if you buy one of these you need to move the OEM ssd to the other m2 slot, then stick your full length SSD in the m2 slot you just took the OEM out of.\n\nIt's easy, and already inside the case are the two heat sinks for SSDs. One small copper one for the OEM shorter 2230 ssd, and a full size heatsink for a normal m2 ssd. \n\nEdit: As per my reply to the other guy below, the battery life is absolute ass on this.",
  "I can run the new Diablo 2 resurrected/remaster on this at max graphics no problem, as long as it's plugged in. That game is a little heavier that you would expect on resources. My Ryzen 4800u with integrated graphics can only handle about low medium graphics. So this thing's pretty decent.\n\nDepending on what you're doing, keep in mind the **battery life is horrible** on this thing. I'm getting worse life than OP when just doing very basic light tasks. I get 3 1/2 to 4 hours max. This is with screen brightness low, no USB devices, the 3050 dGPU disabled, and just using a webbrowser. No gaming or streaming. I've done all manner of tests to squeeze out better battery life and have had not luck (OS reinstall clean, different drivers, setting max CPU usage to 30%, etc.). Dell support told me 4 hours is good battery life for this laptop and referred to the battery as a ***backup battery***.\n\nAlso, if you plan to dual boot to linux this thing won't sleep properly. You can set it to suspend, which defaults to s2idle and uses about 14% battery per hour. Manually modifying the system to deep sleep doesn't work properly, it will start to sleep, then spin up the fans and turn on the keyboard light. This is with Nvidia proprietary driver software and the dGPU off and iGPU on. After researching it, lot's of dell notebooks are doing thing. Dell's forums show things like \"this model doesn't support being set to suspend/sleep and put in a bookbag\".\n\nHopefully this info helps. I'm in the process of returning mine. It's a nice enough laptop, but averaging 3.5 hours of battery life from extremally light tasks with my mentioned battery saving attempts is bad, the linux sleep thing is bad too.\n\nIf you'll mostly be on AC power all day, you'll be fine. But if you're on battery it will not last. Gaming will kill the battery even faster, and it will lower its performance dropping the frame rate badly on battery.",
  "Hey I think your laptop may be broken or you are using it unplugged, because a 3050 usually runs dota 2 at around 120fps at the 65W. Do you run dota while plugged in? because it only uses the integrated intel graphics when unplugged which could explain the low fps.",
  "I ended up buying the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro with an RTX card, dual DIMM slots, and dual SSD slots.  It's a great laptop as long as you don't need battery life beyond 3-4 hours.  LOL",
  "Hey question, are you using windows 10 or 11? I know windows 11 has hit ALOT of laptops negatively in terms of battery life. I’ve heard some people getting up to 4 hours less than they would in windows 10.",
  "To tell the truth I didn’t run it more than a few hours on win10. I did find turning on battery saver made a difference, but it wasn’t major enough. I did also find apps like the brave browser automatically using the dGPU for no reason, setting windows to force it into the iGPU helped a bit.\n\nI did run manjero Linux and was getting batter battery life than when 11, but maybe just an extra 30 mins of light usage.\n\nOver all, I think the battery capacity (56Wh) is just a bit too low for something with an 11800h and dGPU. I tried buying an 86Wh battery from Dell before sending the Vostro back, but they don’t have them in stock.\n\nI moved to a Lenovo P1 G4. That has a 91wH battery, It’s easy to get 4.5-5 hours on that thing without effort.\n\nEdit: more info.",
  "Oh okay thank you for specifying more! Yeah brave turns on hardware acceleration by default for some reason. It’s quite annoying 😂 had a time I was wondering why my laptop fans were spooling up every time I opened brave and was always at a steady 10-30% usage.",
  "Yeah lol, I happened to be looking at task manager and noticed GPU_1 in use with just an empty downloads tab open. Need max power for that.\n\nOther than the battery life, I did really like that vostro.",
  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",
  "Lenovo legion 5 pro after 1 year, is this normal? I don't use it in dirty environments or in bed often, idk how it got so bad ",

  "That’s insane. Clean it immediately. I know you said you don’t use it in a dirty environment, but this surely doesn’t happen from a clean environment",
  "Bro this is an insult to me.\n\nJust clean your laptop once per 6 months at least. And your \"environment\" once a week too.",
  "What the fuck",
  "If you don’t know how it got that bad, you are delusional.  You are 100% using it in a nasty environment.  I’m more concerned that you don’t realize that….this doesn’t happen in clean environments.",

  "TIL: \"Dirty environments\" and \"bed often\" are very relative terms.",
  "you could build a pillow with all that dust",

  "Bruh…\n\nLooks like my ceiling fan if I don’t clean it every month or two… I live in the country where it’s always dusty. My laptop will be 5 years old in January, and just cleaned it for the first time. It wasn’t even a 1/4th that dirty.",
  "How is that fan even turning? Or is it not what the what is that",
  "No way this is a year of use in a clean environment",
  "there's a laptop in your dust",
  "WOW... this is insane for a year of use.\n\nI used my laptop for last 5 years and there is little bit of dust stack to blades of both fans, you can't even see the fan here.",

  "Jesus your computer's life probably got halved with that much dust.",
  "No words",
  "You dirty pig 🤢",
  "Pet dander.",
  "That's mostly fabric, they're usually the ones that can clog, regular dust will just go-in then out the vents easily. It's a combination of how good the intake filter is and how much time do you use your laptop inside you room. 1 year cleaning interval is not normal, you may even consider it as neglect.",
  "The fan determined that’s a lie",
  "It's impossible to have a dust free environment, this is normal and you should definitely keep an eye on it. Ignoring it for too long can cause your computer to overheat. My motherboard was shot from overheating and this is probably why",
  "Does it void the warranty to open the laptop's case?",
  "Fans don't make dust... You do (lots of skin cells in dust). \n\nSo, this has been in a dusty environment this is why it's important to clean out laptops every so often. They will load themselves up with dust quicker than you realize",
  "Absolutely NOT normal, I fix laptops for a living and this is crazy bad for 1 year lol",
  "How often did you use it? For example I have a Asus TUF a16 laptop that got dusty after 3 months of having it and I used it everyday playing games all the time. I don't have a laptop stand so the fans didn't get particularly good airflow so that's why it got dusty",
  "Do you vape? the residue will attract dust.",
  "Have you been using it as a part time laundry drier?",
  "Lol take any cloth you own into a bright room and whip it around. That’s what’s in your laptop",
  "Is it turned on a lot? When the fans are spinning they collect far more dust than if it was turned off. When those fan blades spin at a higher RPM the friction in the air causes the fan blade to build up a electric charge which attracts more dust along the active edge of the blade until you get a sizable mass of it blocking airflow. I would say that looks pretty normal for a laptop that sees heavy use. Laptops don't tend to come with the filters you see in desktop builds so dust has easier time getting caked in there, especially with heavy use.",
  "Stop crying and just clean it",
  "One possible explanation is the fan is somehow spinning when it's in my backpack, but lid closed = sleep so idk how that can happen.\n\nEdit: I overlooked the obvious - my little brother took over my room and now I'm set up in my walk in closet. All the clothes probably release a lot of lint.",
  "No effin way. I’ve had my omen for 2 years, didn’t start using compressed air until 2 months ago, I have THREE dogs and a preteen so needless to say my house isn’t spotless….

  "and pigs can fly too",
  "Maybe he traveled in the desert without your know .it happens",
  "your definition of clean environment seems questionable.",

  "Do you use any kind of cooling pad for your laptop? Where do you use it? Is is dusty there? \n\nBut first of all, just clean it dude...",
  "Just buy compressed air and blow it",
  "My 3 yo gaming laptop doesnt look like that when I 1st open it up. \nYou are living in dirty environment.",
  "Yes, if it is often used in a dusty environment.",
  "Having worked in the medical sector, while it looks clean, it’s likely not.",
  "This would 100% kill the the laptop from overheating over time",
  "I got a laptop early 2020, which I'm still using. I have never cleaned it, and there's maybe 5% of the dust in the fans that's in this picture. You definitely are using it in a dirty environment.",
  "Clean it and everything will be ok.",
  "Hmmmm, I should check my fans…",
  "oh my god no not normal must have been on carpet",
  "If you use your laptop 24/7 and leave it always running then yeah even in a clean environment this would make sense. \n\nI use my laptop occasionally over a few years and there was almost no dust in my fans. \n\nIt's important to vacuum your living space frequently and keep your laptop on a desk. If you have pets, they exponentially increase dust intake. Having this level of dust in one year just points at a high level of dust environment.\n\nI would clean it every 3 months if this is what you gathered over a year. You lost a lot of performance and efficiency overtime, you will gain it back once it's cleaned though.",
  "Very normal, just clean it, ignore the people bashing you for being filthy.",
  "I live in a dirty environment and my shit doesnt get that bad",
  "If you live someplace and you don’t dust and/or bathe often , you live in a dusty environment. Unless you are covering all your skin, you are releasing dust as your skin cells die, what did you think dust was?",

You are a lizard and you loose skin flakes like crazy. Must be hard to keep the human disguise.\nNo other explanation is possible. \n\nWell.. could also be that even when you perceive your environment as clean, it's not that much dustfree.\n\n/S\nYes it's normal. Don't let it pile that much, buy a can of compressed air and blow a bit every month. Not a full clean just a few puffs is more than enough to keep it clean.",
  "Gaming laptops are not meant to be used a laptops. They work as a laptop but they're meant to me more of a portable desktop and used on a hard and clean surface while on A/C power. \nThey rapidly charge and discharge which will degrade the battery.\nIf you only have a couple of hours a day where it needs to function as a laptop then that's fine but if you can then plug it in and keep it off of your lap. \nRemember that when you set this laptop on your bed or lap it's going to be like a vacuum. Cat hair, dust, lint, crumbs, and everything else is getting sucked up. \n\nBuy canned air and clean it out every 3 months if this is how it looks after 12.",
  "Do you play right next to your dryer's exhaust? Like a load of lint in there. You should clean your fans and vents at the very least once every 3 months or when it has noticeable dust on it. You clean that up and you will think you got a new computer; it will be running so much better.",

  "If it looks like that after 1 year then trust me, your house is a whole lot dirtier than you think it is.",
  "Lick it",
  "That's dust and you'd likely be surprised how much dust is just in the air around you. One year is also too long to go without cleaning anything, no matter how dirty your environment.",
  "If you vape thc I've seen grimy dust that looks like that on my computer. Doesn't come off easily",
  "What the fuck\n\nYour environment is probably more dirty than you think it is.",
  "That’s honestly an impressive amount of dust. Usually it doesn’t stick to the fan much, it just collects on the heat sync. Definitely clean it, that much weight will hurt the motor",
  "“Lightly used, clean, perfect starter PC, 4500 obo, open to trades, no lowballs.” All jokes aside, your environment isn’t clean, my house produces dust like nobodies business too, just gotta deal with it for now. I’ve opted for a no case PC, so I just reach over and blow that bad boy out every day or 2",
  "Use more lotion..",
  "pets?",
  "Dust in the air isn't really just diet a majority of dust consists of insulation and dead skin cells",
  "Laptops should never be used on soft surfaces. Beds, couches, chairs, blankets, etc.. You said you don't \"often\" which means you do at times.",
  "Your pc can’t breathe",
  "You smoke inside?",
  "Bro dust your house first lol.\n\nDoor trim,  fans, electronics, blinds, picture frames, air vents, change your air filter, change your sheets, vacuum and mop.\n\n\nYou gotta do that stuff once a week or dust goes rampant.   Get a dehumidifier too.  That dust looks caked on like it wouldn't just rub off with a q-tip.",
  "A year? I clean mine every 2 weeks… a year? Explain a non dirty environment? Do you live in said environment? Then it’s dirty. Not saying you are a dirty human, but dry skin flakes off you everyday creating dust just like this. Plus there are things in the air you do not see that are ever present in your abode. Want it clean? Get a dehumidify and air purifier.",
  "Clean once a month or two with compressed air\n\nIts worth buying a cheap 3m air filter that takes A/D/H filters or you can run the furnace fan more often it does a good job cleaning",
  "If you use it in your lap, it’s just sucking lint and dust off you. Lots of factors to consider. Likewise the humidity around you. Seems like vacuuming or just running an air filter would be good, for your own health",
  "now you know why your environment is clean ......",
  "Animals, dust, dead skin, windows open in dusty areas all add this nasty. Change your furnace filter more often.",
  "Close to a heating and cooling vent? I know the desktop was bad for that",
  "Never set a laptop on a carpeted floor while using it, not only will it suffocate it but the dirt collect on the blades just like that.",
  "Pets?",
  "I live in a small town surrounded by farm fields, even though my apartment is kept fairly clean I have to clean my electronics filters frequently just because of the dust in the air.  If you have pets you may want to clean them more frequently.",
  "I've had a legion for about 4 years now. Leave it on 24-7. About 6 months ago I finally cracked it open cleaned it because I noticed dust accumulation on exterior fan intake mesh and it was nowhere near this bad. Granted it's just been sitting on my kitchen table all these years. Maybe that has something to do with the minimal amount of dust. It's literally just sitting there on all the time. Haven't moved it in years.",
  "So this is why you blow out your laptop fans often, doesn't matter what environment you think you're in. \n\nYou can also keep a bowl of water nearby or in the room that will mitigate it but not stop it.",
  "The mental gymnastics some people do on purpose",
  "Uh gonna be honest. You do use it in dirty locations. Thats rediculous",
  "Did you fuckin buy it used maybe? Lmao",
  "Not normal at all.",
  "If you haven't blown it out for 5 years, I would say yeah, expected. I try to blow mine out like 2x a year at least, regardless of conditions.",
  "Its Completely fine dude, you just have some laptop on your dust that's it! you're good to go with the cleanest environment you got!",
  "Mine didn't even get that bad after 4 years..",
  "Hey hombre - these other commenters don't have our machine.  I am an immaculately clean person, and my Legion 5 Pro builds up dust inordinately fast.  That's probably mine if I left it for a year.  I clean mine monthly, so should you.  But yeah, this is completely reasonable for the way this fan works for one year.",
  "Do ya smoke?",
  "Normal? The computer did what a computer does. \n\nYou on the other hand…",
  "Do you have a pet bird?  Those are pretty much living dust manufacturers.",
  "Excuse me wtf\n\nDo you have pets or is your house dusty ?",
  "Dust will always exist and even if you put it on a desk the the computer sucks up all of the junk that's small enough to get into it's vents cause it's impossible to have a 100% clean environment",
  "perfectly fine",
  "Questions;  \n\n\nAre you in a humid environment?  \n\n\nDo you smoke/vape?  \n\n\nDo you have pets?",
  "Liar You are dirty af",
  "Your home is much dirtier than you think it is…",
  "Ok how the hell it didn't take on fire? No ai wanna know 😂💀",
  "It seems that you already got answers, then I'll just add :\n\nWhen you clean it, don't forget to unmount it and check the filter (left of the vent), should be dirty as the rest.",
  "Lenovo is shit, thats prolly why.",
  "This has to be bait.",
  "Fine dust might not be visible to you, but if there is any on the desk, laptop fans will find it. That definitely needs cleaning. I have a Legion 5, and because of how the vent is designed, it's pretty obvious when it sucks up dust. The bottom intakes change color to grey, and that's when I clean mine",
  "X doubt",
  "Forbidden Cocaine",
  "While my fan does not look close to this, I can see through the venting that it does have some dust and debris caked on. What would be the best way to clean this as I’m a total novice when it comes to taking a laptop apart",
  "Take it outside, hold the fan blade from spinning, blast it with compressed air.  Repeat as necessary, maybe every 2-3 months.",
  "You in a nasty environment for sure.  Ignorance is bliss if you think otherwise.  Wtf",
  "Do you shut it down overnight? My 24/7 running dell wyse looks the same after 6 months of uptime. However, my PC and laptop are really clean after two years of normal use (6 hours a day)",
  "Only normal in a dusty environment.",
  "That is mostly dead skin. \n\nHow often do you take a shower? Once a month if you need it or not?",
  "Easy to clean. They still work, just not as well when covered like that, so not super end of world as long as you let it breathe normally. Take a clean toothbrush and turn the fan as you move the bristles along the fins to push the dust, then use some electronics grade canned air for the best results. Other kinds of canned air can cause Static damage to other components if used.",
  "This is exactly what mine looked like the first time I opened it up and I only have it on a desk. A lot of things can get sucked into those fans so just make sure to keep them clean and be a little more aware of where you put it",
  "If in a clean environment, this can happen if the laptop is powered on for long enough. If it's only 1 year old, and if the environment is clean, I believe you almost never turn it off.\n\nIf you do turn it off whenever you're not using it, then I believe your environment is not as clean as you think.\n\nAlso, if you or someone around you vapes, the vapor can cause dust to stick a lot more than it otherwise would. It could also be the case that there were just a few really dusty days and ever since it's been running hot and the fan is always running at top speed, collecting even more dust.",
  "And I thought my bedroom was a dustbowl for having nothing built up on the fan, and the heatsink fins themselves being about 1/4 lightly covered after two years daily driver use",
  "Holy crap that does not look normal. Surprised it hasn't died due to heat damage yet.",
  "How could you possibly say you don’t use it in dirty environments when the fan looks like that? Come on now.",
  "I thought this was a pudding",
  "Well the dust came from somewhere homie, laptops all use basically the same fans lol",
  "Dust is >80% human skin. You are the dust source",
  "I wish my wife were that dirty.....",
  "If that's the fan, I wonder how you lungs look like (0.0)",
  "lol. Just get a duster and get on with it. This is normal if you are in a forced air hvac setting.\n\nIf it's all radiant heat, you might have issues.",
  "How dirty is your place?!\nI didn't clean my laptop fans for almost 3 years and they barely changed color from the dust!",
  "It doesn't matter how clean thr house is, don't use a laptop on the fucking carpet, especially not a gaming laptop.\n\nThis makes me sick, get a board or something to set it on at least, how would you like if every breath you took, was through some dusty old carpet, would probably mess you up too.",
  "You have a cat or dog?",
  "Just think if this is your lungs. Not Good. Recommend cleaning almost every 3-6 months",
  "You'd be surprised about all the sources of dust. Does it sit on a desk? Dust. Does it sit in your lap? Dust. Etc. \n\nI thought my home was pretty dust-free until I got on the air purifier bandwagon. Whether or not the work, that's up for debate. There's no question about them removing dust from the air",
  "Vaping/smoking anything will cause it to condense on almost anything. A bedroom fan will catch a ton of it, and get dirty before a laptop fan. My old roommate vaped and did dabs, then came to me complaining about her fan being junked up. Her room is kept very clean but condensate and natural dust (as well as three cats) did a huge number on the fan and all its parts. Cleaned it out and applied a little wd40, took longer to get really nasty. \n\nBeing clean won't stop the natural accumulation of dust, and places where air moves a lot usually won't accumulate dust like this UNLESS there's moisture in some form. Weather that's from taking the laptop from cool to warm places or vica-versa, vaping nicotine or any plant materiel, taking it to the bathroom even after a shower or during can cause droplets to form on the blade. Even teeny, tiny droplets will pick up ambient dust. \n\nAnd there is dust. Dead skin cells, hairs, residues from cooking and even cleaning chemicals can create or disturb dust, and it'll settle or stick as it must. Best thing to do is clean that puppy as best you can, and do periodic dust checks on any form of electronics. Little old lady homes that are spotless will have PC and TV fans covered in junk from having a human around, and a liberal application of febreeze.",

  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",

It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do?

  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues.

It has graphical glitches (I have seen screen tearing when doing simple things like scrolling a word document). Tons of audio glitches with headphones frequently disconnecting. It is honestly just a terrible computer overall. Worst computer purchase I have ever made by far. I would highly recommend against buying it based on my experience.",
  "I had it for 1 week now and i will return it. The touchpad issue is so bad and i havent seen this conversations before. First the fans are always on, even on energy saver, just chrome some tabs and they are on. Not crazy loud but they are on. I had Premium care and a technician support. the problem with the touchpad is in the bios \" intelligent cooling\", set it to \"perforamce\" and the touchpad wont sleep,  and works. negative is that the fans then are even more loud. at the end i sent it back and bought the sl7 arm, love it so far.",
  "I had the Yoga Slim 7i aura edition for 1 week and gonna return this crap.   \nLove the screen, performance and battery but slightly pressing on the middle of the keyboard deck shuts the laptop down as if it shorts itself. \n\n\\- Fan sounds like a 1.9tdi   \n\\- Screen flickers when volume up/down  \n\\- shorts itself when slightly pressing on middle of keyboard  \n\n\nVery good laptop for only $1200 CAD but too many flaws.",
  "What is the battery life like?",
  "It could match a MacBook Pro though, and still be a horrible laptop. For example, unless it's one of the newest MacBook pros, you might be used to an incredibly glossy screen that leads to a busted user experience if there are windows or uncontrolled lights nearby.\n\nMy M1 Max MacBook Pro was also incredibly laggy for things like window snapping and some other things where I couldn't get rid of the animation and you just have to wait for part of a second from time to time before you can do things.\n\nPretty amazing that it compares to a multi-thousand dollar laptop, but also multi-thousand dollar laptops these days can be pretty disgusting, or at least that has been my experience with the M1 Max, and some Windows laptops from Dell, Asus, and Framework being laggy with windows 11.\n\nMaybe it's just a software problem though and I shouldn't be comparing wildly inefficient operating systems like Mac OS and Windows 11 to things like debloated Windows 10 or Linux on a 12-year-old Thinkpad originally rated for 24 hours of battery life.",

  "How do the speakers compare to the MBP?  Thx",
  "I currently have the G16 and the aura and when it comes to speaker quality, these two are pretty close. the G16 has a slightly fuller bass and slightly wider sound stage. In my opinion if the G16 are a 10, the Aura speakers are a 9.5. I also feel the browsing experience to be much better on the Aura. I experience more lag on the G16 and the fans kick on, the SOC can get too hot for the G16 to sit on the lap, even with light browsing. That being said the track pad on the G16 is better. while the keyboard on the Aura is much better",
  "I was thinking of buying this but it has way too much bass, since I listen to music a lot that's a dealbreaker for me. Also, the bass resonates across the laptop body which creates a weird sensation if you're typing while listening to music. I tried adjusting equalizer in dolby software but still couldn't get the sound right. Did you find a solution to eliminate bass (so chassis doesn't resonate) and music becomes clear?",

  "Haven't tried any other Lunar Lake laptops as of yet. There will allegedly be a SL7 for business with Lunar Lake next year, thinking about waiting for that. Though knowing Microsoft they'll charge an arm and a leg for 32Gb.",
  "I also posted a review of SL7 a few months ago if you wanted to have a look. The SL7's display is pretty comparable to the Aura's. It had worse PPI (201 vs 222), and worse subjective calibration making it bit washed out, but didn't have the IPS glow issues of the Aura. The AR coating was also better. I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve. The chassis would get way too warm in heavier tasks and the fan would hardly do anything. But still, I prefer the SL7's acoustics. No noise in a docked setup.",
  "Cant seem to get it working on the Aura.",
  "What did you uninstall? ",
  "Which bloatware did you remove?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "Thanks for the recommendation on uninstalling the bloatware.  Any update on the laptop?",
  "It's annoyingly reflective. And it's a pitty because under the perfect conditions it's really nice to look at. But it's a laptop so conditions change and are rarely perfect",
  "Is it a problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "The low RPM noise isn’t too bad, it’s just the fact it’s there at all that irks me. It’s completely unnecessary to have such an aggressive fan curve with a Lunar lake chip inside, but I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker. \n\nThe eye strain comes from the GPU, not the glossy display surface. Same strain when docked. Seems to be recent intel GPU’s from what I’ve read, causing issues for those sensitive to dither, or whatever rendering technique it is that causes the pain.",
  "The Aura screen dimensions are compatible with the MacBook Air 15. Get a MBA 15 compatible matte screen protector, and it'll greatly reduce glare and reflections on the Aura.",
  "was this 16 or 32gb of ram?",
  "BTW, as an update to my experience, I have my touchscreen replaced as it seems to be touchscreen issue instead of touchpad. For a week, touchwood, no such touchpad issues anymore.\n\nThe only remaining gripe I have would be the lack of compatibility with my GPD G1.",
  "Have you uninstalled McAfee already? It will greatly improve system performance. The Microsoft antivirus software built in Windows is better. That's probably the first thing to do after unpacking a new Lenovo laptop.",
  "It's really subjective. Do you have any issues with other modern devices? In laptops I find Intel Xe iGPU's to be bad for eye strain, Nvidia perfectly fine, AMD tolerable but not ideal.",
  "For my ghost touches issue, turns out I went to Lenovo repair centre to have screen replaced, then as of these weeks the ghost touch issue is gone for me.",
  "how did it go? did you send it in and is it still working?",
  "Hello \n\nI am going to buy this laptop soon.\n\nIs there display glare problem a deal breaker?  \nSome people mentioned : glossy displays leading to poor battery life because you have to crank up brightness to max to combat glare.\n\nThanks",
  "Its not easy to buy a laptop nowadays. many models and there are issues on each model. No windows laptop is perfect it seems, unless you pay big amount to Thinkpad series highend one.",
  "Luckily the 15.3\" screen is the same size as the Macbook Air 15, so you could pick up a matte screen protector.",
  "[I just reviewed it](https://smbtech.au/features/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-aura-edition-laptop-review/) and got 26.5 hours. That's a new record on my site.",
  "After using for some time, I think it’s similar to surface laptop screen. It’s reflective but with decent resolution. Colors are vibrant. I mostly work inside so it’s been fine. Working outside might be slightly tough because the screen is pretty reflective (not as good coating as MacBook). If you turn up the brightness to 100% that might make it better for outside work.",
  "I think the same, if not even better.   So loud and clear and good bass too.   I've tested both the 14\" and the 15.3 and had zero issues.  I think the one this person is talking about was just a lemon",
  "Not really, I just got used to it.",
  "Barely but yes. You can be outside (in the shade of course) and make do while in light mode. It's a mirror though, so you gotta find the right angle.",
  "Thank you so much - I really appreciate it. This makes it a buy for me. ",

  "I read about a couple folks mentioning unresponsive touchpad in some YouTube comments and in r/lenovo comments as well",
  "You probably don't need this anymore but its around 8 hours minimum for demanding stuff, WAY higher with regular use. Much more than one needs. If you plan on using it for several days in a row, just bring the charger.",
  "As I sit here looking at my non-upgradeable to Windows 11 Surface Book 2.  You felt and looked premium, I paid a lot for your middle tier processor, I learned what heat throttling was, sometimes you think the screen is disconnected when it isn't, we had a good run. No more MS laptops for me thanks.",
  "Just read it, some great detailed insights there. Definitely swaying me towards getting the SL7, especially given the low/no noise from the fans which is very important to me. Thanks for replying!",
  "How would you compare the screen reflectivity between the SL7 and the Aura? Still waiting for my Aura to arrive",
  "OK, thanks for trying, it is good to know that it is not compatible... by the way, there are several variants, depending on the model (eg 1 or 2 fans) : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qjlal2/tpfan_control_on_newer_thinkpads_share_your/\n\nOn the Aura, there is also a built-in BIOS configured power management, accessible through Fn+Q command : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1fufeoa/lenovo_yoga_slim_7i_aura_edition_ama/lqcjek5/",
  "What if you set the performance/fan mode to quiet? Does that make it quiet enough? I'm thinking of getting this too and have heard mixed reviews about fan noise",
  "Ya, it’s been hit or miss on battery life. Touchpad gets finicky w longer use, appears to be pretty sensitive to the oils on the skin and any grime so I try to use the mouse. I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",
  "Its actually not too bad in person (at best buy) when viewed side by side to the book 4 screen.   I think the book 5 screen has more anti-reflective coating and they did not have that model for testing.",
  "Is the reflection problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "Does anyone tried this?",
  "It had been on sales for £1100 for the Aura 258V 32GB RAM model in the UK (e.g. Lenovo Store, Currys).",
  "Yes the 32 GB version with Intel 258V. Seems like some of the discounts are now gone.",
  "I have the same ghost touch issue, sending it in for repair under warranty in 2 days.  \nhow was you experience with the repair and is it still working?  \nAsking since i have heard many bad things about Lenovo's repair service.",

  "Tell me how the type of graphics card can affect eye strain. Eye strain and other discomforts are caused by PWM and temporal dithering. These are defects or characteristics of displays, and intervening components are unlikely to be the cause, but I could be wrong. Please comment.",
  "I exchanged it",
  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast. The screen is very glossy though. if you work in a very bright room with bright background/light behind you, then yeah it can be very annoying to clearly see your reflection on the screen even at 80% brightness. it's depends see if you can find a sample in the nearest store.",
  "I like your little candy cane for scale",
  "Can you share me the settings that you have used while testing this and was there any major tweaks done to this? I got the same laptop but seems like my idle drain is little bit higher, although I did clean install of windows.",

Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge.

Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo.

  "Yeah that's gonna take some time getting used to 😅",
  "I actually prefer that, now it has a full sized numpad unlike the Y540",
  "Thermals are great, but probably because I have it propped up off the table to give the intake better airflow, so far I've run jedi fallen order and gta v on it for multiple hours, maximum the CPU has ever hit was 80C, and the GPU never crossed 66C before",
  "Around 8 why?",
  "Color accuracy for the screen I chose isnt great because I wanted a higher refresh rate, 120hz, so my screen is rated at 45% sRGB, but there is a 60hz option with 100% sRGB if you need it. In terms of portability, not the best considering it is a gaming laptop albeit not the highest end, it comes in at 2.5kgs or around 5.5 pounds I think, in terms of thickness, around 2cm thick when closed, but the thickness does give the laptop a rather robust and sturdy feel to it",
  "Right results are in, so from 100% at 60% brightness the laptop lasts 2 hours and 41 minutes. This is running YouTube, Microsoft word and discord at the same time, I even had my webcam turned on for an hour, so without that itll probably last just about 3 hours",

  "Why?",
  "It's got an AMD integrated GPU and a nvidia gtx 1650",
  "Yep, trackpad is good, I can very comfortably scroll and browse websites without having to touch my mouse at all",
  "Coding will be no sweat for this machine, the ryzen 7 4800h is more than powerful enough. But gaming... depends on the games you wanna play, for AAA titles I'd say maybe 4 years max, and that's playing games on minimum settings. Because the GPU isnt a high end card for today's standards so 6 years down the line... yeah probably not gonna be too good",
  "Its lenovo vantage, it came pre installed in the laptop",
  "Yep its quiet when not under heavy loads, if you're really worried about noise, the laptop can be set to quiet mode, so the laptop will automatically limit the speed of the cpu and gpu to keep fan noise down. As for using it on my lap, not the most comfortable because of its weight, and the damn numberpad at the side, because it means you cant rest your hands on the laptop in a symmetrical position to ensure the laptop stays balanced on your lap",
  "Trackpad feels good, sensitivity isnt way too low like my friend's laptop, and if you find it too sensitive you can lower it in the settings. Based on settings it does support windows 10 gesture control, it has 3 finger gestures and 4 finger gestures. Battery life is just shy of 3 hours on the balanced mode, but based on another reviewer, when set to the power saving quiet mode, it's just shy of 4 hours, but there are ways to improve the battery life but at the expense of performance of course. \n\nI bought this laptop purely based on specs and my personal faith and preference for lenovo products",
  "I find the gtx 1650 enough for me, I used to play using a nvidia 940mx so what you guys feel is subpar gaming performance to me is amazing gaming performance",
  "Yeah but a downside is that the webcam doesnt support windows Hello face recognition",
  "I disagree, I actually feel the build quality is great and the whole thing feels really sturdy, the hinges too, nothing about this laptop makes me feel the slightest bit of concern",
  "I paid 1556.47 singapore dollars which equates to 1115.75 usd",
  "Intel 10th gen CPUs when compared to AMD 4000 cpus are shit and far behind in performance",
  "I cant say for the 7I but mine certainly feels sturdy",
  "1. Yep it feels really sturdy, probably helped by its extra thickness, I generally disagree with those who say the hinges feel weak because when I opened it, it actually gives me good confidence that this machine will last, but who knows maybe it might weaken over time.\n\n\n2. Trackpad works great, it's really precise, I can comfortably lean back and use 1 hand on the track pad to browse websites, no need to pick up the mouse at all, only gripe is the number pad making the touchpad off centre and it just bugs me. As for keyboard, idk how to review this because I've never used what's objectively deemed a bad or lousy keyboard, but lenovo said they did copy the thinkpad keyboard design so I dont think you'll face any issues or discomfort. I personally find it comfortable.\n\n\n3. I took the 60 whr option as I needed a 1tb hdd to store all my school related stuff, but I'm not sure if the AMD version even has the option of the bigger battery. As for battery life, I'm actually about to test it, I've been running the laptop on battery conservation mode since I got it to prolong the battery lifespan, so I'm getting it to 100% now so I can start testing it, will update you when I got results",
  "Right results are in, so from 100% at 60% brightness the laptop lasts 2 hours and 41 minutes. This is running YouTube, Microsoft word and discord at the same time, I even had my webcam turned on for an hour, so without that itll probably last just about 3 hours",
  "build quality feels really good, the laptop as a whole just feels pretty sturdy. I think this laptop will last no less than 3 years, note im not someone who games on ultra settings, i am content gaming on low settings and lock to 30 fps, so if you have big gaming expectations, no way this will even last 2 years for you. As for battery life, im testing it as im typing this reply, im running on medium power setting, with youtube and microsoft word running at the same time to get a more accurate result",
  "Right results are in, so from 100% at 60% brightness the laptop lasts 2 hours and 41 minutes. This is running YouTube, Microsoft word and discord at the same time, I even had my webcam turned on for an hour, so without that itll probably last just about 3 hours",
  "Because I'm a student and I need a laptop, and having a desktop means I need to deal with constantly transferring files back and forth to get my work done, plus I'm not interested in the pc master race either. I'll probably only switch to desktop when I get a job and need a workstation",
  "Nope, but it can charge your phone using a cable through the usb c port",
  "I'm currently running a test to see how long 100% lasts while on youtube, mc word and discord",
  "In a well lit room I need the brightness at at least 50% to see clearly, I havent tested outdoors because well I'm stuck at home right now",
  "Mine came with a gtx 1650, but it's a laptop version so it cant be compared at all with your desktop",
  "Idk, you should go email lenovo for that",
  "The screen I chose is only 45% sRGB but 120hz. But if you need 100% sRGB for content creation, it is available too, but only 60hz and it needs a additional $10. Build quality wise, it is solid, it feels robust",
  "I cant measure it, I dont have any equipment. But it isnt ridiculously loud even at performance mode, with my game volume at around 50, I can hear my game clearly, or with headphones on, can't hear the fans at all",
  "Same here, I personally never use the number pad and would have much preferred if they used the space to give the keys more space between each other, I'm still regularly hitting the wrong keys because I've always used the touchpad and sides of the keyboard to align my hands",
  "I would say AMD, more cores for lower price, and especially if you top up to get the ryzen 7 4800h, it can match the performance of the latest i9 10980hk",
  "I never heard of a legion 5 coming out on june 21st, is that just the release date for your region?",
  "Speaker sound is abit soft for me because I have it propped up off the table using these little rubber pieces on each of the 4 corners, so the bottom firing speakers arent able to have the sound bounce off the table, but the laptop does come installed with Dolby Atmos for gaming, and in jedi fallen order, there was a 7.1 surround sound option for audio. As for heat, generally most of the heat is towards the centre of the computer, near the hinge and away from the main WASD keys, so no major concern of keys being hot to the touch",
  "Nope, but I already had a permanent subscription on my Microsoft account, so logging in was all I had to do",
  "Unfortunately the option for a gtx 2060 is not available yet, lenovo said it will be coming later in the year, so I dont know anything about how much it would cost",
  "In the bios, there is switchable Graphics. so u can turn it on. In addition, Lenovo vantage allows you to toggle the hybrid mode which means it only activates the dgpu only when gaming or other gpu intensive stuff",
  "Fan noise isnt very much, honestly when I was playing more demanding games like jedi fallen order, having the volume at 50/100 was enough for me to hear all the game audio very clearly over the fan noise, as for the LOL test, I'm not a league of legends player but with how low the requirements to run it are, I'd imagine 120 fps should be no sweat for this laptop",
  "I ordered on 22nd may, UPS delivered it to my door on 3rd June",
  "Uh, any idea on how I could run a test?",
  "Pretty decent, the only benchmark worthy game I have is jedi fallen order, I get a very consistent 80+ fps, occasionally it dips to around 70+ fps. This is on the max settings.",
  "By the way, you can still consider buying the AMD version, lenovo will be adding the option for better GPUs later this year, up to a rtx 2060",
  "Nope, processor has never exceeded 82C ever, and GPU never exceed 66C, this is playing jedi fallen order on epic settings",
  "only intel variants. But in the bios, switchable graphics is available. Hybrid mode on lenovo vantage works similar too",
  "It's not battery saving mode which stops the charging at 60% its conservation mode, in Lenovo vantage there is rapid charging and conservation mode. As for the keyboard backlight, I have the issue too, but honestly it's quite a insignificant problem since the backlight does still work",
  "I ordered with student discount, without it you should be able to get similar spec just that instead of ryzen 7 you can probably only get the ryzen 5.\n\nAs for lenovo customer support, amazing honestly. Every time I've emailed the Singapore lenovo customer support, I get a reply the next business day, some times even just a few hours after I sent the email. Plus there's quite a funny story with how I got my laptop so fast.\n\nThe story is that when I ordered it, the product page says expected to ship within 6-8 weeks, but then the next day it changed to ship within 4 weeks, so I wrote a email to customer support asking to clarify, the rep apologized and said he'd help me email the shipping team to expedite my order and the next thing I knew, my laptop was shipped out in less than a week. Reached my house in 10 days.\n\nIf you want a cheaper option with similar ish specs, L340 Gaming is your best bet, has the same gtx 1650 but only a  i7 9750h",
  "I got mine for SGD$1309+ 93(GST)\nRyzen 7 4800H\n512SSD\nNvidia Geforce GTX 1650\n300nits 144hz screen\n\ni used the coupon code CUPONATION15 to get 15% off. (Shaved off almost 250 off)[Found it by googling lenovo discount code]\n\nOrdered mine on 3rd july tis yr prolly still works>",
  "There are 2 m.2 nvme slots, but you can choose to have a hdd instead if you want cheaper storage, but you can always remove it in the future to install your own nvme ssd. As for the single channel ram, I cant say for sure, since the ram is running at 3200mhz, considerably faster than the intel counterparts, it shouldn't struggle to run anything unless you've got loads of apps running at the same time",
  "Seems really average, just a standard 720p camera you will find in many other laptops",
  "What do you mean by tint? And yes you can add a 2.5 inch HDD, I have one added. Y540 has slower processors, 9th gen i5 and i7 are no match for ryzen 5 4600h or ryzen 7 4800h. Y540 has slower ram, 2666mhz vs 3200mhz, Y540 has smaller battery 52.5wh or 57wh vs 60wh or 80wh. But y540 has gtx 1660ti",
  "You can change the refresh rate and theoretically it should improve battery performance",
  "also... where dat rgb at?",
  "I'll get back to you on the exact numbers because although I've been playing a lot of GTA V recently I never paid too much attention to the temps, but every time I glanced over at the on screen display, it always hovered at around 60-68C, take these numbers with a massive pinch of salt, I dont think me looking at temp reading once every 20 mins or so can be too accurate",
  "Nope, no problems at all",
  "10 days after ordering, it reached my doorstep",
  "No soldered ram at all, 2 empty ram slots. Ryzen supports speed up to 3200mhz for ddr4. You can put up to 32gb ram, I have a 8+8 config",
  "With Hybrid mode on, window battery saving 40% brightness, mine lasted 5hrs [I was using the Lenovo gaming mouse tho so that might had drained battery too]",
  "It's the 120hz, I dont even notice the supposed lack of color, maybe its just me. I've never had high end machines before",
  "Thermals are really good, I've played gta v and jedi fallen order at max settings and CPU never crossed 80C and GPU never crossed 68C. The screen problem is exaggerated. The reviewers need to criticize it and in terms of the specs of the screen it is very easy to bash it because it is inferior to many other laptops out there. But using it as my daily driver, I dont even notice it",
  "Nope, but no big deal for me, I can still click on the battery indicator on the taskbar and just click to on the backlight",
  "Gaming and video editing yes no problem, but if the video editing is like 4k video or very intensive stuff, I'd say upgrade the processor to the ryzen 7. The only concerns would be 8gb might not be enough for you and that a gtx 1650ti cannot run for example rdr2 at max settings at 60fps. But as for things like programming, and running virtual machines, no problem at all, unless you're running say 3 windows 10 virtual machines and all from the same HDD in which case the HDD will bottleneck really hard. I know because I just tried it yesterday, not a nice experience",
  "Uh idk I've never played sims before but I'd imagine it wont have any problems, the CPU crushes virtually everything else available, and the GPU can run pretty graphic intensive games well too",
  "Nope, when I enable caps lock only the small light in the corner lights up, I tried cycling through the backlight modes and indeed, the backlight stays off when I enable caps lock",
  "You definitely can connect an external monitor, that's what the HDMI port is for",
  "Brightness is not the best, only 250 nits. Color accuracy is 45% srgb so horrible for any content creation work but no problem for things like programming. In a well lit room I've found 50% to be okay for programming. But when it comes to like csgo, I push it to 60-70%. I have yet to use 100% brightness yet. As for the color accuracy I really cant tell you, I've never had any high quality screens before, always using budget laptops so honestly it just looks the same to me",
  "Unfortunately no",
  "Unfortunately I have no way to test this",
  "1. The laptop isnt too big for my backpack, but it is bigger than a regular 15.6 inch laptop because there is a area behind the hinges with a lot of IO ports. As for the weight it is rather heavy but there should be no problem putting it in your lap for say, a lecture.\n\n2. As for charge time I cant say, because I havent returned back to campus for lessons yet so ive been running on AC power all this time to reduce battery wear. It does support Lenovo Rapid Charge though, so it cant be slow. I can probably give you a rough estimate when I return to campus next week\n\n3. The only disadvantage I've faced is really only the weight of it. However that is the trade off for really good cooling. Like really good, I've never seen temps cross 80C even when I ran benchmarks. Other than that, probably having to readjust to this new keyboard layout. I've used 14 inch laptops my whole life so now having to ditch my, align hands to the both ends of the laptop when typing, to having to shift to the left as there is the number pad on the right. I find myself hitting the wrong keys alot during the first week of use",
  "It's installed on my SSD, I have a 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD config",
  "I got the 120hz, the 144hz was not available when I ordered it",
  "After 2 months, hinges are still perfectly okay, there are no scratches on my unit yet but there are scuff marks from the other things in my backpack rubbing against it, you could always buy a sleeve if you want to avoid this. As for battery life, I'd done a test before and posted it as replies, basically using chrome, mc word and discord video call, on 60% brightness, it lasted 2h 41mins",
  "Nope, I actually like the stickers and it's my way of flexing on my friends with their shitty intel 4 core CPUs",
  "Nope, no issues at all",
  "If you choose the rgb backlight add on, yes",
  "That's normal, mine does that too",
  "Always go for a PC over a laptop simply because a PC is upgradeable but a laptop is not. Only ever go for a laptop if you're in a situation where you need to travel and bring your work with you alot, example, student",
  "Yep, but out of my personal price range",

  "Yep definitely, I've run virtual machines on it and the fans were never at a noticeable volume",
  "I think I can safely say I'm the one of the first in my country to get it, I ordered it first day it went up on the lenovo website and when the website updated the shipping time from 4-6 weeks to 4 weeks, I emailed lenovo asking to clarify. The rep misunderstood me thought I was pissed off and apologized saying he'd expedite my order. Hence it ended up getting shipped just 6 days after ordering and it arrived after just 10 days on 3rd june",
  "Just that there arent many reviews out there yet, so I thought i could answer questions from any prospective buyers",
  "Yep, no issues so far apart from the wifi card not being detected at one point which was fixed with a BIOS update. \n\nNo hinge issues, build quality issues or even temp issues. I haven't cleaned it even once in these 2 years btw. Tho ofc the fan now runs noticeably louder due to that dust build up",

It’s an exceptional laptop for the money I guess, but I will still send it back.\n\nIt’s too heavy for my needs, even if it isn’t really heavy for a gaming laptop. I had to give it a try, and I’m honestly kind of sad as it’s a great device - just not MY device. Guess I’ll have to go back to real office laptops / Macbooks and have to refrain from additional gaming capabilities on the go.",

  "With shipping? What are your specs?",
  "Not true. For processes like gaming Intel 10rh gen still holds the throne as games are more on single core performance. Ryzen trumps Intel in multicore processes, but it does not outright beat Intel.",
  "I heard about that",
  "Can you please post a short video of you holding it, typing on it snd so we can get a feel. \nThe wait time to order get the 7i is more than 5 weeks here , I winder why ?

It throttles quite a lot :(  \n\nI have a cooling pad and I undervolt as well, still hits 95C sometimes. Fucking lenovo they couldn't figure out the new intel chips are a no go for laptops when they had the 8750H in there? nope took another 2 revisions with new intel chips to realize how retarded of an idea that was. fkn lenovo.   \n\n\ni shouldnt complain though, could be much worse. it took them close to a year to fix a software issue with the hotkeys.",
  "I honestly had never had experience with high end machines too, so you're saying I could get past the supposedly bad panel for gaming and watching movies? is it as dim as they say?",

I'm not that informed when it comes to computer hardware sorry about that. I don't really play intensive games too but I think Overwatch is one that I play. I'm just concerned for programs like Adobe applications etc. and some games. We're on online classes too so I'm hoping if this is also a good laptop for work things yoo. Thank you!",
  "Sounds really good. Now i'm used to large 17.3\" laptops with numpad, so the keyboard probably won't be a problem for me. I think i'm gonna buy it. Thanks for the quick response!",

  "I think you are also one of the first outside of China lol",
  "Hopefully mine will be be shipped as fast as yours, i ordered mine 2 days ago.  Was there an indication when they will ship the xbox one s that they are giving away with this purchase?",
  "Truly appreciate it, but my question was kinda pointing at the machine, why that. As I've been looking to replace my almost 5 year old hp laptop, I've been out of date with what's new and what's worth it given a vast price range. So I was asking why this one, what made you pull the trigger and what's different about it that caught your eye.",
  "Great to hear... I'm welling to buy legion 5 15ith6h",
  "Yeah! What's the ambient?",
  "An extremely underrated comment xD",
  "lol",
  "No idea man, the sRGB percentages were the specs given on the lenovo website while I was customizing the laptop specs, but the 100% sRGB option did require additional $10 top up though",
  "Well it wasnt available on my country's website so, lucky you I guess",
  "I mean it is just a laptop at the end of the day, plus I'm sure in a few months there will be new stuff which will put mine to shame, tech moves way too fast",
  "it really is... if you don't like RGB or playing games on the go...",
  "The surface is plastic, but the inner side with the keyboard, the surface of the plastic has this slight softer, rubber ish feel to it. Id say it makes typing abit more comfortable. But as for long lasting, it seems it will last a good few years, but not if you spill liquids on it",
  "No need to feel too down, take a look at the ideapad flex 5, with the ryzen 7 4700u, the vega 7 integrated gpu isn't really all that bad, it can run GTA V smoothly albeit not at max settings",
  "Shipping was given free by lenovo, my full specs are, ryzen 7 4800h, gtx 1650, 16gb 3200mhz ddr4 ram, 256 m.2 nvme ssd, 1tb 7200rpm hdd, screen is 250 nits, 1080p, 120hz",
  "Yeah, but in my opinion, for gain of just 10fps that too when you are above 60fps it is not value enough for me to leave 20% better CPU performance with AMD.",
  "https://youtu.be/9JgefLqzfsk\n\n\nThe above is a chinese review of the same laptop but with a ryzen 5 instead, only thing is that the laptop is sold under a different name in China, skip to around 10 minutes, it shows the reviewer opening up the laptop to reveal the ram",
  "Gaming isnt what will reduce the lifespan of the machine, rather its your gaming expectations which will. Because ultimately this laptop's maximum GPU at the moment, is a GTX 1650TI, a card which isnt even seen as a high end, or top of the line card by today's standards. As time goes on, games will only get more and more demanding to run as games are all pushing towards or even past 4k 60fps. So if you are someone who wants to play games on the highest graphics settings at all times, then in a pretty short time, you will find that the laptop is no longer powerful enough for your gaming needs. Hence shortening the lifespan",
  "It's just alot of people always tell me, laptops are a waste of money, and that desktops can give way better performance etc but as a student I just need the portability. As for it being overpriced, while true to a extent, I believe spending more now means I wont have to worry about my components becoming hopelessly outdated for quite a few years, especially when I've now got the ryzen 7 4800h. Basically I see it as spend more now so I have to upgrade even less frequently",
  "Right results are in, so from 100% at 60% brightness the laptop lasts 2 hours and 41 minutes. This is running YouTube, Microsoft word and discord at the same time, I even had my webcam turned on for an hour, so without that itll probably last just about 3 hours",
  "sure! :)",

  "I'm not sure about exact percent but for my order it was probably just below $200 off, I think around $180+ so probably around 10% off",
  "Personally, I feel that if you're not looking at getting the GTX 1660ti, the legion 5 is the way to go, the ryzen processor is just more powerful and consumes less power so your battery lasts longer too. As for intel 9th and 10th gen, benchmarks have shown that the difference is negligible, they basically are reselling you the same processor with a new sticker and name. Plus if you only want a 512gb ssd, you can get a free battery upgrade for the legion 5 to 80wh from 60wh\n\nI'm a IT student by the way, and I mostly run VMs and programming too, and so far, I've run 4 VMs at the same time, from kali linux to windows 10, and I can switch from one VM to another, with no lag at all, no slowdown noticed",
  "Yep, it has 2 m.2 ssd slots, if you dont want the hdd you then have the space to install 2 ssd instead",
  "RGB on keyboard i meant. did they get rid of that?",
  "Average CPU temps while playing gta online with max settings is 65C, but that's with the laptop propped up to improve air intake, so without that might be around 5C higher",
  "It's only bad for if you ever find yourself using it outdoors and it is sunny, because the screen isnt bright enough for that. But otherwise in a well lit room, 50-60% is all I need to see clearly",
  "Btw you can choose to add on if you want rgb back lighting for the keyboard, otherwise the default is just a plain white backlight",
  "The ram is upgradeable, it has 2 ram slots so you can just buy your own extra 8gb stick in the future if down the line you find 8gb to be too little. As for the storage, my opinion is that always have at least 1tb, so you got sufficient space for any games and that your storage will definitely last you a few years before you need to worry about cleaning up your files. But the legion 5 15 comes with 2 m.2 nvme slots, so once your 512 gb stick is full, you can buy another one, install it and boom more storage space. And if you're running things like photoshop and premiere pro, I'd recommend 16gb ram, especially now with online classes you probably have another video calling app open at the same time which will take up ram. As for if it's a good laptop for work? Absolutely, I'm using for my school work, no issues at all, only that it's on the heavier side. But id rather it be a little heavier than it catch on fire when I play games",
  "Fun fact, my laptop shipped out on 28th may and the sticker says manufactured date is 27th may, so you could say my laptop came super fresh",
  "I dont think I qualify because they only put up the banner on the website mentioning the free xbox was after I ordered mine so",
  "What got me was mainly the ryzen 7 4800h processor, I was actually intending to buy the Lenovo L340 gaming instead initially until this appeared on the lenovo store, the 8 cores the ryzen 7 4800h has allows me to do a lot of multi tasking work smoothly. Plus it comes with a gtx 1650 which would allow me to play the few games that interest me and also allow me to continue playing games quite a few years down the line even as games get more demanding, as I dont have high expectations or requirements for graphics. Finally was the price, in my country, this legion 5 15 cost the same as the L340 gaming when both are customized to equivalent specs, and the fact the ryzen 7 4800h has 8 cores vs the 6 cores in the i7 9750h, and can support faster ram, 3200mhz vs 2666mhz, and also sports the latest intel wifi 6 card which allows for maximum wifi speeds, something the L340 gaming didnt have. \n\n\nOf course this does beg the question of why didnt I look at say ASUS who also had laptops carrying the new ryzen 4000 series processors, that's because the ASUS TUF series firstly has cooling issues, and according to the asus rep in my country, isn't gonna be in stock for the foreseeable future. Plus other companies like Dell with the new xps laptops, sell at a very steep mark up in my country, therefore making it no longer value for money.\n\nSo in conclusion, I bought it because based on everything available I felt it gave me the best performance per dollar, and was within my budget",
  "If op is from Malaysia, it must be around 25-30 room temp (celcius)",
  "Lmao",
  "Ok",
  "I know, but compared to my aging Acer E5-475G, that thing is a daydream and it'll be a while for me to afford something like that",
  "Ngl man that's pretty expensive for the specs, paid just as much as I did for the A15. I bought an Asus and I'm allowed to mod it to solve heating issues but I can still return it. Wdyt?",
  "I mean for the money yes 100%. Just that everybody seems to think Intel is getting it's ass handed to it. Indeed it is, but it's able to compete with AMD for a reason.",
  "Awesome \nThank you\nWhat are your thoughts on durability etc and using it for business. Do it look professional.",
  "Okay that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for explaining and also for taking the time for this thread. Definitely helps buying decisions.",
  "As for the brand.How do you compare lenovo to let's say Asus?and what do you think about the slim versions zenpads etc.I'm more into multimedia,working on stuff etc.",
  "Nice! Pretty good considering the specs!",
  "Hey, no worries! Thank you so much for the efford! Unfortunately I am not to sure what to make out of the result. Did you leave it running for 10-15 minutes? I Found a post of someone else on Reddit who checked his Legion 5 with latency moon (unfurtunatly with rather bad audio results). I leave you a link to the screenshots of the test he did:\n\nhttps://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21APyCACszmM3KlG8&cid=620A128F8C369EA2&id=620A128F8C369EA2%215333&parId=620A128F8C369EA2%21103&o=OneUp\n\nDid yours look anyhting like this? For the sake of comparation I also attach the link to a screenshot a user did on his Rog Zephyrus G14 (with proved to be good for audio rendering). \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/J042sd9\n\nYou can see that latency moon provides a text eather highlighted in red or green stating if the system is capable of handling real-time audio. Would you mind run another test and screenshot the results? Would be much appreciated. It is a critical bench for audio production and almost no reviews run it.",

  "Nah, my country's Lenovo store doesn't allow customizing, what you see is what you get. Which is slightly disappointing, but hey you get the new\n Ryzen 4000 series  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
  "Okay thanks I'm more confident in buying it. It really has a business vibe to it yet it can be for gaming too. I'll probably upgrade the RAM and the storage in the future. Thank you!",

  "I just placed my order for the legion 5 AMD 4600H version  :). I feel like we had the exact same process regarding choosing this over the L340. plus this one has 2 ram slots, where as the L340 and the newer Lenovo 3i series have only one ram slot (which is really stupid because those laptops are doing everything else right).\n\nI was able to get a Father’s Day deal and combined it with a student discount. Basically worked out to ~15% off from Lenovo.com (Canada).\n\nCan’t wait to test it out!",

  "Problem is that I emailed asus asking about the A15 and the zephyrus G14, but the rep said that neither will be in stock in my country for the foreseeable future, plus in my country, computers in general are sold at marked up prices compared to in the usa so paying the price I did is actually considered a massive steal in my country",
  "What kind of modifications were you talking about?",
  "Yes, they are trying to compete ,that's why they are still better in single core performance.",
  "It feels sturdy and robust, but it is on the heavy side too. As for using it for business, definitely possible, it is much more subtle and quiet looking from the outside compared to the likes of asus where its flooded with flashing lights and RGB. All it has is a iridescent Legion logo and that's it, other than that just pure black",
  "Personally I just dont like asus, because every time I go to a tech fair, asus always charges more than lenovo for similarly spec laptops, if you're interested in a slim laptop, you can take a look at the lenovo ideapad 5 AMD version, it sports the new AMD 4000 series processors, but a low power version so you get much better battery life, but it is capable of boosting its speed when under load so no need to worry about lack of performance, and it is relatively cheap, only thing is it doesnt have any dedicated GPU",
  "Which listing did you click on in the lenovo store, theres the regular legion 5 15 and a legion 5 15 build it yourself or sth like that, choose the regular one, for some reason the listing which is meant for complete customization gives me a higher price for my exact same configuration",
  "The legion 5 at the moment only has up to a GTX 1650ti, but Lenovo said that they will have up to RTX 2060 coming later in the year\n\nThe default is 60wh, you must make sure to choose that you do not want a HDD, the legion 5 has 2 drives, so choose your 512 gb SSD, then choose no hard drive for the second and the battery will automatically change to a 80wh battery\n\nDont let the pipes fool you, the thermals for the legion 5 is amazing, I've run jedi fallen order on it on epic settings, and the cpu never exceeded 80C and GPU never exceeded 68C, but that is with the laptop propped up off the table which does improve the airflow to the intake vents",
  "Generally yes, propping up the laptop will improve temps slightly. That's because most laptops' rubber feel simply dont lift the laptop high enough to allow good airflow through the intake vent at the bottom. So usually the restricted intake does have an effect on high temps",
  "Nice, how much was the total cost after the discount?\nI was actually about to just have the ryzen 5 4600h but after applying the student discount, suddenly now my budget could allow for the cpu upgrade so I went for it",
  "why you got it?",
  "Same. I bought from a reseller of Asus because the price from official here is so insane lmao. Hope you enjoy your new laptop!",
  "Hi, don't get the A15. Capacitor fried itself after a few days in service..I returned it and bought a Lenovo Y540.",

  "Thanks.I had a friend who worked for Lenovo,they are pretty solid.And probably the cheapest",
  "only the build it yourself option shows up for me. talking to the service rep, he said they're only offering a 5% student discount on that product at this time. \n\ni ended up getting a sgd1709 config (after -90 for student) because they're also running a free xbox one s offer if you spend >1500 on legion? random ass offer but i figure i can recoup some cash by selling that thing.\n\nanyway thanks for the info, this thread helped me make my purchase decision!",
  "Thanks. \n\nI checked again unfortunately the only legion 5 that will be available in india is non upgradable with 60wh battery fixed I can add a HDD though. \n\nSo now it's the same almost just that it will be amd (which is great!)

  "It was lenovo's on site warranty guy also contacted them regarding this",
  "Remove the screw aand replace it with the shorter one the tech was suppose dto have used, then you can take a Bic lighter and heat the spot up and press it down once the plastice is pliable, should only take a few sconds of flame to heat it up enough, then use the sloped side of the lighter to pres the plastic down. It won't be perfect but it's an easy fix.",

  "There you go.",
  "Ah yup they put a screw that was too long in the wrong place. I would take it back to the person who did the battery repair.",
  "That tech had to be a noob. Remove the screw, find the short one at either the midway or back side, and swap them, then roll over the spot with the round part of a spoon and some force, and you can usually get it very nearly back to normal.",

  "What do you think about the new Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Gen 10?  Ryzen AI 7 350, OLED and 32Gb RAM for 900€ ",
  "I have one but with sadly a ryzen 7 7735hs and not an AI 7 350. But I have all maxed out options.\n\nIt's an absolute BANGER of a laptop. It's very light and thin, build quality is pretty good and the OLED is really bright. \n\nPerformance wise it performs as you'd expect from the specs as far as mine is concerned, but i can't tell for the RAI7 version obviously. \n\nKeyboard is good as well. The integrated microphone is *extremely* good for a laptop, hands down best laptop mic I've heard. I'm running Linux on it, it's very well supported and everything works as expected except the mic which needs a kernel edit to work (I've sent a patch a month or so ago, but i think it got forgotten :/ )\n\nIn the bios you can dedicate from 256mb to 4gb to the igpu. However the bios is fairly limited in terms of what you can do in it.\n\nNow that I know the ryzen ai 7 version exists I'm sad I didn't wait :( \n\nOh and one last thing, at least with mine I bundled a 2year accidental damage warranty for 35€ which is nice, idk if that's still available but it's a nice to know.",

Check the Lenovo Product website. It was soldered in Gen 9 as well. You can change the SSD(s) and the Wifi Card. Gen 9 only had one ssd slot for 2242 btw.

It's however not the quietest if you're loading the cpu hard (compiling code, virtual machines or heck even games since the 680m can game pretty well), but nothing too terrible. \n\nOverall on linux it's not even making any noise for most tasks.\n\nAnd yeah, you're not getting anything better for that kind of money. I recommend getting the fat (70wh battery) for best experience.",

  "Is the ram upgradable upto 32 gigs ?",
  "Yeah for sure, the radeon 680m is more than capable for those. But I'd suggest getting an actual gaming laptop if you're only doing gaming.",
  "Hi,\n\nYeah for sure. Still a great laptop. I'd recommend getting the OLED screen if your budget allows for it, it's really worth it in my opinion. Also since the memory is non upgradable getting the 32 gigs of ram is not a bad idea either (and if you can't get both the oled and the ram, get the ram) especially if you're running windows",
  "[removed]",
  "Something around 5-8 hours ? I get 5 because I’m always on HDR at 120hz with the ram set to 7500MT/s (they added a setting in the bios to change it), but I remember getting closer to 7 hours before I did all that, even 8. So with web browsing and programming it’ll last you half a day maybe. It also charges pretty pretty fast.",

  "Old ones okay maybe if decently priced. Problem are new ones, being super overpriced while offering very little. An example : A mid range T14 G5 with a core ultra 5 125U, 60hz 1200p sRGB IPS display, 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage, which for those two are getting below today's standard, is priced at 1200€. Those are specs you'd find on a 600-700€ laptop, not a 1200€ laptop. At 1000€ you can already get something well built with a Ryzen 7 8th gen, 32gb of ram and 1tb of storage (Asus Zenbook, HP Elitebook, etc). In this case that laptop OP showed was a pretty fine deal, but if you took a Thinkpad for the same price you'd have an E14 Gen 6 with even worse specs. They stay good, don't get me wrong : but at any price range there's pretty much always a better deal.",
  "They still good",

  "I am less sure the RAM is upgradeable depending on the model actually. Just double check I'd say.",
  "Keyboard's alright. As for the burn in, I think it'll be fine, especially if you don't run max brightness (the screen is very bright, even half brightness is much brighter than most laptop screens) and auto hide taskbar. Bonus point if you use a OLED friendly theme (iirc the O365 suite has one where the background and ui is pure black). Those are only preventive measures and not really 100% necessary unless you're really scared.",
  "Yeah, I think it’ll perfectly suit your use. You can even play games on it like Fortnite at native res with amd adrenaline’s capper on 75 at 70 fps, Minecraft at 100 fps, the 780M is great.",
  "The AI 350 is slightly better, but the 256v does it all at 17W. Normally the Intel one should have better battery life. Will very easily handle what you said, even some more intensive tasks like gaming.",
  "Hi dear, how about the fan noise? Do you often hear them?",
  "Strangely it's hard to find an 8845hs or 8840u ddr5, good battery life + screen laptop here in India without overpaying a lot. \nBut I found an almost equally good Ryzen 7 AI 350 laptop with 860M igpu, 32 GB ddr5 5600 MT, 60wh fast charge. I think that'll be almost equally good as your laptop?",
  "so the intel would be the better choice ? between it doesn't have the multi threading capabilities, that's why i hesitate",
  "The ai 7 350 has a weaker iGPU but is normally slightly better than the 8845hs, would be close or even better since it also consumes less.",

  "thank you! it's real nice :>",
  "The display is 1920x1080, 165hz, and honestly real good! Screen can get pretty bright at full brightness, but as laptops work that can effect the battery life (on the go). The 165hz perfectly suits with the rtx 3050 ti, and it's really smooth. Would definitely recommend.",

Played a bit of Valorant last night after using the laptop to download some stuff on the laptop and got a solid hour and a half. Browsing with Opera GX on battery saver mode definitely saved a lot of the battery. Wouldn’t recommend Google Chrome though, anything you can do on Google chrome can be done on Opera :)",

  "Performance is great, the only con for me is the battery life. With watching movies or shows, you can maybe get 4ish hours of watch time and with games I typically see 1-2 hours of gameplay before the battery gets low. Great laptop as long as it can be powered while playing. I really love the RTX, my desktop has an rx 580 and that is nothing in comparison to this. Overall, a great laptop!",

  "also, if you don’t want to spend this much there are some cheaper options, if you’re not going to be playing games or streaming or any of that, i’d think looking for a laptop with 8GBs of RAM would be a better option, however if you’re editing videos and playing games as well this is definitely the right option.",

After that you can also check for gift cards or any offers from the site where you are purchasing.\n\nPersonally this is a lot cheap for the laptop, even with the bag and you should check for accessories combos which will really help you out in the long run. Mostly check for these accessories- Mouse(type-c charging), Mouse pad, Laptop stand, Pendrive. Although these are not much important but you can have them if your budget allows to.\n\nMost important- Warranty should have a minimum of 2 years and 1 year ADP + If you want then just add 1 year additional, no need for 2 years additional. I had made this mistake and did not get ADP. Now I have to pay half the price for my laptop just to get the display repaired.\n\nADP is Accidental Damage Protection, this is in case like the laptop gets dropped by you, water gets in or the laptop falls.This may not sound important but companies get you here to pay for repairs, I had made the mistake myself that is why I don't want others to make this mistake.

  "Looking at the Lenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 10 AMD (16″) for mechanical engineering + power and gaming use. Is it any good or is there any better? Hey all, I’m in my mechanical engineering program (so lots of CAD, simulation, maybe some rendering, plus general heavy multitasking) and I also have a Mac for lighter stuff, but I’m looking to get a *really* powerful Windows laptop that is also reliable and high quality. My budget is about **$2,000 CAD** (or close), and I’m considering [The Legion Pro 5 Gen 10 AMD (16\")](https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83LTCTO1WWCA2). Specs/options;\n\n* Processor: AMD Ryzen 9 8945HX (16C/32T) in this model. \n* Screen: 16″, WQXGA (2560×1600) presumably, good resolution for engineering/design work. RAM: I’ve upgraded it from 16 GB → 32 GB for $90 (seems like a very worthwhile upgrade for my use-case).\n* GPU: I have two options: stick with the RTX 5060 (the base GPU in some configs) or pay **$200** more to upgrade to the RTX 5070. Specs at a glance: RTX 5060 and RTX 5070 both 8 GB GDDR7 in this model. \n* Other specs: The model supports solid ports (USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, RJ-45) and build looks quite decent.\n\n**My questions to you all:**\n\n1. For my use (mechanical engineering, CAD/simulation, maybe rendering, multitasking, gaming), is the RTX 5070 *worth* the additional $200 compared to the 5060? Will I see meaningful benefits (in CAD/engineering workloads and gaming) or is the 5060 “good enough” and worth saving the $200?\n2. From the perspective of reliability, build quality, brand reputation: how does the Legion Pro 5 line look? Are there known issues (thermals, noise, durability) I should be aware of? I want something I can rely on through my degree and beyond.\n3. Given my budget (\\~$2,000) and the upgrade I’m doing to 32 GB RAM, does the config seem balanced (CPU strong, GPU choice open, RAM done) or am I perhaps over-investing in something that won’t pay off long-term?\n4. Any red flags (in this model or manufacturer) I should check (e.g., warranty, serviceability, cooling, noise level under load, portability/weight given 16″ size)?\n5. Is there any other laptop that is better and more powerful for this price range?\n\n**What I’m leaning toward:**  \nI really want headroom so I don’t feel like I’ve “cheap-ed out” on the GPU, especially since engineering software and maybe some creative work might benefit from a stronger GPU. On the other hand, if the 5060 already handles everything well and the difference to 5070 is marginal (or mostly gaming-oriented), then maybe I stick with 5060 and save $200 (and invest elsewhere maybe SSD, battery, etc).\n\nWould love to hear from folks who have used this exact model (or similar Legion 5/Legion Pro rigs), especially engineers or users doing heavy workloads (not just gaming). I would also love to hear if anyone has any better options that heyve personally owned. Thanks in advance!\n\n  \n",
  "The majority of the computational workloads you will do as a Mechanical Engineer will be mostly handled by your CPU rather than your GPU, the GPU will mostly just be used for making the visual model that you will be manipulating (so not nearly as significant). The mobile 5070 this generation isn't that much more performant than the 5060 either and is still restricted to 8gb of vram. I wouldn't say going for the 5070 would be worth it.\n\nNow, although the 8945HX is a Zen4 CPU rather than the most recent Zen5 architecture it is still very formidable and can easily last you for years in regards to CAD and FEA. As for gaming that is kind of up to you.\n\nYou could technically get better performance in CAD with a competing Intel CPU as those tasks do heavily rely on single threaded performance but the AMD cpus these days will do way more than fine for that.\n\nNow, 32gb of ram is great for smaller to medium sized builds but if you would like to carry this into the future you should go and get a 64gb kit. That's a problem for the future though, 32 is fine for now.",
  "Thank you thus is the best reply I got so far. Just for a follow up, you think this is one of the best in the market for what I’m specifically looking for or would you say there’s better?",
