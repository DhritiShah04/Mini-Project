  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience). I have a Lenovo duet 5 now which I love but the snapdragon is feeling a little long in the tooth when I have more than a few tabs open.\n\nI guess my heart says Lenovo but brain said MacBook Air.",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop. Having good speakers is a great bonus for the Lenovo for me, as well as a bright screen. Don't need maximum power as for heavy workload I want to rely on remote desktops.",
  "Check your local best buys, in my area (SE Michigan) the Lenovo is on BB as a used excellent for $530 which is the right price point. So see if you can find one in your area for that price",
  "Unfortunately not near me but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nWhat do you think the chances of the kompanio lasting close to apple silicon?",
  "Not sure, thats a ChatGPT quesiton lol \n\nHappy hunting, hopefully you can find one soon.   I hear that they are high-end Chromebooks with Spandragon x Elite processors coming; I'm hoping they are here just before the holiday season.",
  "Ended up with the m4 MacBook air. It went on sale on Amazon for 750(!) and I can't find the Lenovo near me. Also mixed in the surface laptop for fun but the air just seems too good. Thanks again for your help!",
  "Looking to buy new laptop under 1200 USD Hey Everyone,\n\nTLDR - \n\nLooking to Buy a reliable professional-grade laptop around 300,000 PKR with strong CPU performance, expandable RAM and SSD options, a capable GPU for rendering, decoding, and solid build quality. Preferably new with local warranty support.\n\nAny recommendations or feedback would be highly appreciated.\n\n\\------------------\n\n# Back Story\n\nAfter a long while, I have finally decided to upgrade my laptop, but the current market dynamics is too confusing for me right now esp. between currency hit, price differences, open-box deals, and Masked/refurbished options, it has been difficult to decide on a laptop that truly fits my needs. I would really appreciate some input from the community.\n\n# Current Setup\n\nI’m currently using an HP ProBook 450 G5 (8th Gen). It has served me well, but it’s beginning to show its age, especially under heavier workloads.\n\n# Requirements\n\nCore Specifications\n\nCondition: Brand new preferred  \nCPU: Intel i7 (H-series or equivalent or better)  \nRAM: 24 GB (16 GB minimum with expansion slot - no soldered ones)  \nStorage - (Must be SSD + HDD option)\n\n* SSD 512 GB for OS (second slot for future expansion is a plus)\n* HDD SATA 1 TB (2.5” inch)\n\nDisplay: At least IPS with decent color accuracy & brightness  \nGPU: Nvidia RTX Ada series or something slightly stronger for rendering, encoding/decoding performance. I can work with gaming series but no older than 4000 series.  \n  \nPorts and Connectivity\n\n* Multiple USB A/B/C 2.0/3.0 ports for accessories (mouse, external drives, cooling stand)\n* 3.5 mm audio jack\n* VGA/HDMI port for external display\n* RJ45 LAN port\n* Wi-Fi 4/5 GHz support\n\nKeyboard and Build\n\n* Full-size backlit keyboard (numpad preferred)\n* Rigid build with minimal flex or hinge wobble. Weight isnt an issue.\n* Easy to open for cleaning or upgrades\n* Local parts availability for future maintenance\n\n# Usage Pattern\n\n* My workload involves heavy office use with constant multitasking, often running numerous browser tabs alongside background tools for downloading and file-syncing. Current system starts to lag with ram & cpu reaching max capacity before apps start crashing.\n* I do not play games on the laptop as I have a ps5 pro for that - so I dont require top end latest GPU.\n\n# Not Considering\n\n* MacBooks, due to hardware/software compatibility issues with some custom tools I use.\n* Touchscreen, 2-in-1, tablets, flipbooks or hand-held devices\n* Desktops, as I often work from multiple client offices and need portability\n\n# Current Thoughts\n\n* I’ve been considering Lenovo ThinkPad T or P Series, but many models seem to use TFT panels by default. \n* HP Victus models have good specifications but poor reviews regarding build quality, screen wobble, and keyboard flex. \n* I’m also uncertain about Intel versus Ryzen options and would appreciate insights on that. \n* My goal is to move to at least an IPS panel, since my current laptop has a TFT. OLED would be ideal, but likely beyond budget.\n\n# Budget: \n\nAround 300,000 PKR\n\n# Important Points\n\n* Models that offer the best balance of performance, portability, display & build quality\n* I would prefer numpad on keyboard but if laptop model is worth it then I can compromise as a trade off.\n\nI know I might be asking for a lot, but any advice or recommendations would really help. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to share their thoughts.",
  "Pls help me choose laptop :3 HI guys! So im looking for laptop for only studying/ working and my girlie staff like binging netflix series at night... so it doesnt need to be super powerfull but it should be compact. I would love a device that would last me for years. I narrowed it down to these 2 options which seems to suit my needs best:\n\n1. Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Ryzen 5 7535HS/32GB/512+1TB/Win11P \n\n2. ASUS ZenBook 14 UM3406KA Ryzen AI 7 350/16GB/1TB/W11P OLED 120Hz.\n\nThey both seem to be nice and well enough for my needs as im not gaming on laptop (rather use Playstation). The price diffrence between them is not as important to me as choosing one that would be a more solid option and would last at least 5 years :3. The main diffrence between them seems to be the processor: ryzen 5 7535HS (lenovo) vs ryzen AI 7 (ASUS). Also the ASUS has OLED and I can see it is well reviewed but I'm not sure I need it as much as I am not a laptop-playing kind of girl. Also I read that there may by some technical problems with OLED such as burning in and I really cant afford service :p and thats why I am looking for something reliable and for years. \n\nI would love and appreciate any piece of advice <3 Thanksssss",
  "I would go for Asus Zenbook. It has more powerful CPU as well as OLED display - these displays usually have higher brightness and wider color gamut.",
  "I really don’t like my Zenbook, I would recommend a 100-200€ eBay lenovo or the like and a pack of cute stickers to put on it, it’s cheaper, the keyboards feel better, and they’re very unlikely to break or have issues. Modern luxury laptops are usually unrepairable, unreasonably expensive, and have bad performance compared to super loud and hot gaming laptops of the same price. If all you’re looking to do is watch movies you could buy 10 eBay laptops to do it on for the price of one modern expensive one.",

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Which laptop is best for coding purposes and multitasking? I don't want a gaming laptop , need it for coding purpose mainly. I am almost going to complete college soon so buying a new laptop which is convenient to carry.\n\nSo, some suggestions are:-\n\n1.

So, would like to have some reviews about it\n",
  "NEVER buy asus laptops they are masters in pc motherboards but recently asus is horrible in laptops and their drivers and everything. for you or generally speaking Lenovo should always be your first option because it is with no doubt the best preformance per value in the market or you could also get a HP which are great but i favor Lenovo. and the ideapad slim 5 is THE BEST option, it has the best build quality and also does not break the bank.",
  "What laptop should I get? I'm an engineering student who also works in research and coding, and I'm looking for a new laptop. I was currently using my dad's old ThinkPad T450s, and it lasted 8 years and still works smoothly, but the battery life has deteriorated a lo,t and it's just not portable anymore. I'm looking for a new laptop on a more student-friendly budget that would work well with VSCode/Vim, Linux, and VMs. Here are some of my choices:\n\n**ThinkPad E-series 14:**\n\n* Intel Core Ultra 5 125U Processor (E-cores up to 3.60 GHz, P-cores up to 4.30 GHz)\n* 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\n* Windows 11 Home\n* Cost: ₹68.9k\n\nI don't know much about the quality and performance of the ThinkPad E-series, though. Since it has a U-processor, I'm a bit unsure about its performance.\n\n**Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3:**\n\n* 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13620H processor\n* 16GB RAM LPDDR5-4800 | 512GB SSD, expandable up to 1TB\n* Cost: ₹66k\n\nHonestly, the processor seems good, but I've heard negative reviews about the build quality of IdeaPads.\n\n**MacBook Air:**\n\n* Apple M1 chip\n* 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage\n* Cost: ₹59k\n\nAlthough I've heard positive reviews of MacBook Airs from professionals, the storage throws me off a bit, and many people don't recommend them for college.\n\nSome of the other laptops I've considered are Lenovo LOQ and ASUS, but these are my personal top choices. If you guys have any suggestions for any other laptops or experience with any of the laptops listed above, I'd appreciate any advice.",
  "I am also looking at laptops but I can say one thing for sure. **Do not buy a MacBook**, a lot of engineering software is not compatible or doesn't run well. I get that they are attractive in terms of battery life and power but it's just not good for this type of work. \n\n\nI also noticed that intel works a bit better with low level programming and is a bit more stable with Linux. The new intel CPUs are quite nice with battery life and performance. \n\nFrom the laptops that you provided I would get the ThinkPad with intel 5 125U, the performance is alright, I am using a Ryzen 5 5600H and this intel is better in every way. The build quality on ThinkPad was always ok, the E series are a budget friendly for people that can't buy a T series or X1.\n\nEdit: the CPU in the IdeaPad is going to be a bit more powerful in computing but the integrated graphics are way worse and the power efficiency is also worse, so I guess if you value battery life and graphics, the ultra is the obvious choice.",
  "I'm considering a thinkpad with ryzen 7 since it's also budget friendly. Def not considering a macbook anymore. Thanks for the advice",
  "Confused between two Which one among the two should I get is the price increase of 3000 INR (35$) justified? Intel version is about 55000 INR (630$) and Amd is about 58000 INR (670$). Also as one of them doesn't have Windows and MS Office I can just get its key for cheap online. I chose these as they have extra slot for Ram and Ssd expansion. Will be using this laptop for 4-5 yrs\nI need it for my college (MBA) so no coding and all also I rarely play any game will use it for watching movie and college work only. I know one is U series and another is HS series both will have different performance but, is the performance worth battery drain for my purpose [Also is that Amd 5 7535HS processor good?]",
  "ThinkBook 16 vs Swift Go for multipurpose everyday laptop? Hi, first post here after reading TONS about laptop brands, multiple reviews, lots of 'best laptop for school' posts, youtube reviews etc etc. Yes, I am a student. I wanted a good laptop that will last a good 3 to 5 years. Im mainly doing lots of word, excel, powerpoint, and have lots of tabs open at once, watching videos. Im also interested in some amateur photoshop stuff. I also will be watching a good amount of movies, and I'd like play some video games. I think if the laptop would support it, I would play newer more demanding games, like Cyberpunk and Alan Wake 2, but gaming is not the focus. If I could at least play games like Witcher 3 and maybe baldurs gate 3, and some emulators for PS2, PS3 and PS4 games I would be happy. \n\nOriginally I bought a Legion pro 7i with the 4080 and intel i9, because I wanted a laptop that could handle most anything and be relevant for years.

  "I've tried out (almost) every flagship windows laptop and here are my thoughts Hi! For some context, I'm a 20-year-old university student who's been looking for a new laptop for the past YEAR (we'll get to that). I'm coming from an [8-year-old Asus laptop](https://www.asus.com/Laptops/S56CM/) that's pretty much on its last legs, so I thought it was time for an upgrade. I wanted something pretty lightweight and portable (so a 13\" or 14\" screen) so I could bring it to school to take notes and do work on. I wanted something powerful enough for some regular multitasking and web browsing, and for some light gaming (like League of Legends). \n\n\nI wanted to make this post to share my experiences with each of the laptops that I used. I possessed each one for between 1 week to 1 full month, and tried to use them as thoroughly as possible.\n\n\nFor some more context, I am pretty detail-oriented. I wasn't in too big of a hurry for the computer, since my old one still works and is not awfully slow thanks to an SSD upgrade I got a couple years back. So I was open to doing some buying and returning because I wanted to make sure I got the most value out of my money (which I think is a pretty common thought for students without a big stream of income). \n\n\n[**Laptop 1: Asus Zenbook UX331FA-DB71** - *I- 'm lo-..sing co-nn..-ect- ion...\"](https://www.asus.com/ca-en/Laptops/ASUS-ZenBook-13-UX331FA/wheretobuy/)\n\n\nI got a pretty good deal on this one ($1000 CAD), and it's a very premium-feeling computer, very reminiscent of a MacBook. Some specific pros:\n\n* You can open the lid with 1 finger\n* Solid build quality \n\nHowever, the glaring weakness of this laptop was the bad Wifi. It had similar problems to my 8-year old pile of trash Asus, where the laptop would frequently disconnect from the internet, even if the connection itself was stable (by frequently, I mean like 1-2 times per day). This is a particularly bad thing considering that many students are now transitioning to online learning, and it would be pretty unfortunate to disconnect in the middle of a Zoom lecture or online exam... In addition, there was a noticeable amount of coil whine, which was audibly annoying in a quiet room.\n\n\n[**Laptop 2: Microsoft Surface Laptop 3** - *yo dawg, i heard you wanted some problems with your problems...*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/p/surface-laptop-3/8vfggh1r94tm?activetab=overview)\n\nThis one's another very premium-feeling and attractive laptop. It has a very nice glossy touchscreen (which I didn't find myself using that much since it isn't a convertible). I got the model with the i5 and 256gb of internal storage.\n\nThe first unit I received performed without any issues until around a week in, where I noticed that the laptop played a static sound in my headphones every time the computer was being charged. This sucked for me because I have my headphones on at almost all times. So I exchanged it for a replacement unit, except the second unit came with a different problem- the fan noise was uncontrollably loud when it was charging (even without anything running). I also noticed some coil whine on this laptop too. As for a smaller issue, it's difficult to open since there is no notch to hold to open the computer. You have to hold it by the side with one hand and pull it open with the other. \n\nAnyway, I thought that maybe this computer wasn't for me considering the issues I was having, so I returned it.\n\n\n[**Laptop 3: Dell XPS 13 7390** - *what the reviews don't tell you!*](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/xps-13-7390-laptop)\n\nI thought I'd go for a Dell this time, since every reviewer online and their mother has been ranting about the Dell XPS for years. I purchased the i5 model with 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage. I'm aware this isn't the most up-to-date XPS model, but some of this may still apply. The main pros of this laptop are:\n\n* It's incredibly small and lightweight (it fits into the laptop sleeve of my mom's 11-inch laptop)\n* It has a non-glossy screen which is good for reading in sunlight\n\nThat's pretty much where the pros ended for me... \n\n* The first thing I noticed was the really loud fan noise even when no demanding programs were being run. This was particularly irritating, however it seemed to be reduced after switching a setting in the BIOS. So not bad.\n\n* The battery life isn't as good as you think. I brought the laptop at close to 100 percent charge to a 75-minute lecture. I kept it on battery-saving mode and I had it at the absolute lowest brightness setting the whole time. I was typing in a google doc and I had a couple of pdf's open- basically, nothing intense. By the end of the lecture, I had a little under 80% left. Considering it drains quite a bit of battery on idle, you might want to bring a charger if you have more than 3 to 4 lectures in a day...\n\n* The laptop itself doesn't sit flat on a table (if you tap the bottom left side of the laptop, it rocks back and forth). I only noticed this later on and it's not the most noticeable, but you do notice it when you take off and put your palm on the computer.\n\n* The keyboard has good key travel, but I noticed some of the keys are \"sticky\" and don't press all the way down. \n\n* It takes around 10 seconds for the computer to wake up from sleep. Sometimes it doesn't even wake up and I have to restart the computer fully.\n\n* After one Windows update, the fingerprint scanner fully STOPPED working. Even when it was working, I found it only identified my finger 75% of the time. Not bad, not great.\n\nI thought that I was facing these problems because I had received a \"bad apple\", so I exchanged it for a new one. On the newer model, the keyboard felt a bit better but the other issues were all still apparent. So I decided this one wasn't for me and returned it.\n\n\n[**Laptop 4: HP Spectre X360 13\"** - *Sure View is the worst thing since not sliced bread*](https://store.hp.com/CanadaStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=7YZ55UA&opt=ABL&sel=NTB&lang=en-CA)\n\nI decided to up my budget a bit and went all-out on specs, getting the i7 with 16gb of ram. It's a very lightweight and compact computer. The keyboard is really nice and clicky, but...\n\nThe Sure View display is... really bad. The viewing angles are absolutely atrocious. The screen only looks normal from one specific angle (looking exactly head-on), if you move your head even a bit, you get this ugly dark-to-light gradient appear on the screen. When you lay it flat to use in tablet mode, the laptop dims almost entirely and you can barely see anything (even when the computer is on full brightness). Unfortunately, the vast majority of x360 models available in Canada come with this technology, so I have very limited options. The screen gets very bright, but I found it didn't get *dim* enough (it really strains your eyes when using it in a semi dark room at the lowest brightness setting). Also, the trackpad is not good. The trackpad is loose/wobbly at the bottom, where a light click doesn't register, so you really have to press down for it to recognize. It's not a great trackpad in general. The laptop also crashed twice while I was playing League of Legends, and I had heard in a review the performance is inconsistent so my experience may be a reflection of that. Also, you need the strength of 100 actual men to plug in and unplug cables from the USB ports (they stick in a suspicious amount...). \n\nI was pretty disappointed with my experience with this one. Besides those flaws, it is pretty usable, so I thought I could fall back on this one if I really found nothing. So I decided to return this one and get the one I've been looking at for a long time:\n\n\n[**Laptop 5: Lenovo Yoga C940 14\"** - *a volcano...?*](https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/laptops/yoga/yoga-900-series/Lenovo-Yoga-C940-14IIL/p/88YGC901221)\n\nI had high hopes for this one. I saw no glaring weaknesses in all the reviews I read about it. When I first received it, I was instantly sold. The display was big and vibrant, the battery life is great, the speakers are awesome, it works great in tablet mode with the pen, and it has a good keyboard and trackpad. I only noticed an issue once I plugged it into an outlet to charge and it got... HOT! Even with only a couple of tabs open, the computer got hot to the touch, to the point where it was a bit uncomfortable to type on or having it on my lap. I hadn't noticed anything like this in any of the other computers. This is even more pronounced when I was playing League of Legends, and that's when the keyboard got even hotter, to the point where it was actually uncomfortable to rest my fingers on it, and the portion above the keyboard got even more hot (I couldn't keep my finger on it for more than a few seconds before it burning up). I tried undervolting my device using ThrottleStop, but I noticed almost no difference.\n\nI find that the computer warms up as soon as you do something any more intense than some web-browsing, video watching, etc. It's not too bad when the computer is running on battery mode, but when it's charging, the CPU gets up to 50-60 degrees celsius on idle, and I reckon in the 90's while playing games. \n\nI'm currently typing this on the Lenovo. I feel pretty lost and defeated at this point. In my experience, when looking for a Windows laptop, it was less about which one had the specific features I wanted, but was more about which one had the least significant cons. Which one is the lesser evil. I haven't really hesitated to return because I can survive university with pen-and-paper, but it feels a lot better with a laptop. I may be being a bit extreme, but 1500$ to 2000$ is a LOT of money for a student to dish out on a computer, especially with many students being unemployed now, and concerned with paying tuition. \n\nI think the biggest thing I noticed was that a lot of the problems I faced are pretty easy for even the typical, non technologically inclined person to notice. I wonder how these brands are letting devices through with issues this apparent. I am really questioning these brands and their quality control processes...\n\nSo that's where I'm at. Not sure where to go from here. I'm definitely considering switching to Apple just so that I don't have to worry about these things. That's all!",

Both are relatively new so not too many reviews or much info online about them currently that I could find. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can get both laptops with 16gb RAM however the HUAWEI comes to £1099 and the LENOVO just £670 with RYZEN 5 4500 or £740 with RYZEN 5 4700. The HUAWEI comes with 512gb SSD whereas currently can only get 256gb SSD but with an additional 1TB HDD on the LENOVO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other factors are HUAWEI is touchscreen (which I doubt i'd use too frequently) not sure whether LENOVO is (confusing website!). Also the HUAWEI comes with a mouse, backpack and bluetooth earphones worth over £100 which makes it more appealing as I am looking to get some earphones. But the price gap of at least £300 makes me think the HUAWEI has to be better technically to warrant that price?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo please if someone could provide some advice on which would be better for me I would be very grateful. I would be mostly using the laptop for creative uses mainly music production on Ableton but also will probably use Photoshop and some video editing software if possible. Additionally will be doing the regular browsing, creating documents etc and the option to do some gaming would be nice but not overly fussed about any seriously demanding games.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the links to the products:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHUAWEI:  \\[[https://consumer.huawei.com/uk/laptops/matebook-13-2020/buy/](https://consumer.huawei.com/uk/laptops/matebook-13-2020/buy/)\\]([https://consumer.huawei.com/uk/laptops/matebook-13-2020/buy/](https://consumer.huawei.com/uk/laptops/matebook-13-2020/buy/)) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLENOVO:  \\[[https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/IdeaPad-5-15ARE05/p/81YQCTO1WWENGB1](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/IdeaPad-5-15ARE05/p/81YQCTO1WWENGB1)\\]([https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/IdeaPad-5-15ARE05/p/81YQCTO1WWENGB1](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/IdeaPad-5-15ARE05/p/81YQCTO1WWENGB1)) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance for your advice :)",

  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget €2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years. As longevity is important, I believe performance is an important criteria. My current setup is an 8th gen Intel i5 Asus laptop (8/256) and a M4 Mac Mini (24/512) on the desk. I want to replace both of these items with a single Windows laptop and I'll sell the Mac. I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around €2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. €1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. €1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. €1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. €2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. €2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** €2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",
  "Have you ruled out Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024 or 2025)? It is a cheaper Asus ProArt with the same of internals.  These Asus model carry the best speakers of all Windows laptops which is nice to have if you have kids or others to share a screen.",
  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",

  "Also, unlike the ProArt you don't need to pay for a 4070 you said you wouldn't be using much. The 16:10 screen is also good for web development with it's bit of extra height. P1's are also pretty much the top of the Thinkpad scale, being workstation laptops and thus very solid. P1 gen 7 is also 17mm thick and 2kg so pretty portable.",

  "I think Just Josh did a great objective breakdown, the good and the bad without any hype whatsoever.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/elpeaSO0MtY?si=U3Tl-Tho18bQKkEq",
  "It looks that the marketing strategy of Microsoft and Qualcomm is to not emphasize it. It is just a good performing laptop with great battery life. If I look in the webshops it is listed along to Intel and AMD without mentioning that you don't have x86.\n\nSo, the OEM's will silently push it. They have already ordered the parts for this year. So, if it doesn't sell, they will lower the price.",
  "Probably bc Apple branding is ranked higher/higest in most Google/youtube algo and also have more audience. And maybe bc people susceptible to herd behavior. Qualcomn has to build their brand in the laptop space also",
  "Well most of the reviews are sponsered and only few of the reviews show redflags about snapdragon x elite. Personally I would say these chipset are overhyped. The advertisement/promotions only show their highlights. If you look at the red flags, most of them are major redflags making it worst for purchasing. It is because this is new chipsets with arm based architecture. Some software have compatability issues. Most of the softwares haven't updated for this processor. Even in windows itself there are too many bugs (most of them dont get fixed with reset). There are reported issue with even connecting a  basic peripherals life keyboard it doesnt get detected because its using incompatable software.\n\nThis processor is only for people who only use basic apps/popular apps (atleast for now). If you need performance these aren't for you. Macbook and  some of Windows u/P series laptops can easily be better in  performance per watt  compared to new snapdragon chipsets.\n\nIt may can be one of the best to buy in next few years, if they fixed all of the major issues. They are noticebly quieter than intel/amd laptops and give best performance at lower wattages.\n\nBeing honest though , nobody is excited because these chipsets are neither best performance nor for battery life. There isn't anything catchy for videos. Most of the people who are intrested in latest laptop videos are either a power user/ gamer. Casual users are uninterested in laptops videos.",
  "Apple has a better influencer-based PR campaign management. They spend most of their profits on ads. Windows based manufacturers are all on their own so you will only find specific machine reviews. \n\nThats why you always get the dumb crowd buying macs lol",
  "TBH, I doubt his objectivity given the first video on these was a sponsored one and since, it has been quiet in terms of specific coverage of some of the devices already available for sale…",
  "Apple IS a fashion brand. Everything they build has looks first, features third, just look at the vision pro. All their users care about is the fit and finish, that's why Apple fanboys will mock android users for when the phone lags a bit or when an app looks old. They don't care if it works, they only care it looks good and performs the minimum functions expected of such a product, just like people who buy designer clothes and bags.",
  "The thing is, Microsoft has been tinkering with Windows on ARM for quite some time, even before Apple release the M1, and it still can't replace the x86.",
  "With Apple devices, there are also embargoes but they lift one or two days before the early deliveries. We are now weeks in since the Snapdragon stuff hit and still no serious reviews…",
  "I could turn than around: if Apple products are as overhyped and overpriced as some here would claim, I would expect that the release of competing products would trigger a veritable avalanche of ‘bye bye Apple’ style reviews, showing how the new contenders either match Apple performance and quality at lower cost or outright trounce Apple in the performance department. \n\nTo date, none of that happened. \n\nAnd for the ‘marketing budget’ argument: Microsoft are not exactly a small fish either. \n\nI am an Apple user currently but I would buy a Snapdragon device drop of a hat if I would find reliable indicators the quality is there…",
  "His second video about it was explicitly not sponsored by any of them and LMG usually has transparency about sponsors as a high priority.",
  "Even if it was sponsored, he compared battery tests which the snapdragon outperformed the 14\" MacBook Pro. So that alone is EXTREMELY impressive. They then did a follow up video recently where 3 guys compared using it for a month and what issues they faced.",
  "Honestly idk\nIt seems like plenty of time and the reviews I’ve seen have said good things but it’s still kinda new",
  "There are reviews that ditch apple products. \nMainly because you can get better laptops for the price that can game.\nPeople thay buy.apple just do it for an opinion and opinions ar e meticulously planted by apples PR team. \n\nYou can get great win laptops for the same price you dump into a macbook. \n\nThe macbook air has lots of competing machines from lg, huawei, xiaomi, and even some cool lenovo and asus models which even compete with some pro m2/3 models for the price.  Not to mention the new snapdragon platform.\n\nI mean, i got a 32gb ram lenovo slim 5 14 because it offers me macbook pro specs for1/3 of the price, it weights 1.5kg and I can game anything on it. With a bit less battery life as the only drawback. \n\nMacbooks are good machines for some creative stuff dont get me wrong, but they are quite limited in performance for vram requiring areas, their prices are a racket (300$ for extra 16gb ram L O L), and their corporate behavior is the Monsanto analogue in the computer industry.",
  "Also, In recent videos, he said things Long the lines of, \"we won't be covering those sort of things in this sponsored video, but look for our upcoming unsonspred video for more of a deep-dive\", or something to that effect.",
  "I used to think just like that but when you check 500-1000 Euro laptops it is hard to find M1 or M2 MacBook air alternative with the same quality, no fans, very long battery life. You can get a new MacBook air as low as 1100 Euro or second hand 350 Euro.",
  ">when you check 500-1000 Euro laptops it is hard to find M1 or M2 MacBook air alternative\n\nSorry, but again, it depends on what do you need the laptop for. You can't use Air books for anything but video watching and office work (no fans means bad thermals for intensive tasks).... For the form/weight factor its a good and relatively accessible laptop within its price range.\n\nBut if you want something that can game or be used for advanced editing requiring RAM and VRAM, You're far better with some other laptop, since Macs that would serve for that are in the 2k$+ range.\n\nAnd then, that Air edge will shortly fade away as other manufacturers start massively implementing the new gen of CPUs (Snapdragons, etc) and the mid-range laptops for casual/education/office use get a lot thinner and lighter.",

I see alot of brand lists saying that because a laptop brand is expensive that makes it worse. I completely disagree with this as quite frankly I don't care about price because with 2-5 years of ownership It's irrelevant.\n\nThis is based on depreciation as well. Some laptops you can never resell. And also this is excluding gaming laptop brands. I put Razer in there as It's not quite gamer laptop focused, they still offer good battery life and design style is not gaming laptop. It's close to MacBook like.\n\nAnyways let's begin.\n\n***S Tier***\n\nThese laptops are far ahead of A tier because of 3 things. Price depreciation, support, reliability.\n\n**Apple** has by far the best resale value of any laptop brand you could buy. You have 2015 models going for 1K still. Support is incredible as you always get software support for like 5 years. And Reliability is insane. Not even to mention MacOS. Once you go Mac you don't go back. I'm loving the ecosystem and the flexibility of going to Windows if I choose to. But overall. I'd easily get an Apple laptop over any laptop on earth. \n\n**Microsoft** is the apple of the windows world. Exact same. Their surface laptops and surface books are the best windows laptops I've ever had. My surface laptop I've owned was so reliable and smooth and I've never had to get support for it as it just worked. Reselling it was super easy. And if I was to buy a windows laptop this would easily be what I'm back to. Best overall design, battery, performance all in one. If you can get an old surface laptop 3... Get it. No matter what. \n\n***A Tier***\n\nThese laptop brands are the best of the best you can get that is not S Tier. They're pretty much head and shoulders above the B Tier. Each of them has a distinct strength about them. And some of them are almost S Tier, just not quite there yet.\n\n**Razer** is more like A+ tier but I think they just need more time and more choices. Also finding these laptops at your local best buy is almost impossible. But if you ever find yourself in a position where you want a gaming laptop. This is undisputed king of that realm. Great battery life and it's the best looking windows laptops you can get.\n\n**Lenovo** is super reliable. S tier level reliability. I love the Thinkpad laptops as they are the coolest designed laptops ever and overall if I had to buy a laptop in the 1.5-2K range it would easily be Lenovo. Best value out there and quality is insane. I'd easily get a Thinkpad if there wasn't a Surface Laptop available. Best overall windows laptops. Insane battery life and quality.\n\n**Dell** is borderline S Tier however reliability is what it's missing so I strongly suggest to not buy anything that's not XPS, Latitude. I've never experienced problems with my XPS laptops ever. They're some of the best designed laptops and resale value is amazing. If I wanted some performance and a mix of battery. Dell all the way. \n\n***B Tier***\n\nThese brands are great however just not near the level of A Tier. They're super solid on all fronts, but what's missing them from A tier is their high end-ultra spec'd options are no where near the A Tier.  You can never go wrong with these brands. All super good quality. Good consistency across the broad\n\n**Asus** is a great brand that has the zen book series and quite honestly dominates the mid-range market. They offer unique designs and some of the coolest laptops out there. I'd say this brand is B+, just hasn't produced a high end laptop yet that I'd buy. But strongly would suggest this for the average person as there is something for everyone.\n\n**Huawei** is a great for ultrabooks and they offer really good solid build quality and performance for its laptops. However like LG and Razer, it's almost impossible to get this at your local Best Buy. I'd pick this brand over the Asus if I had to choose between one because they're super solid laptops.\n\n**LG** is a brand I really like because of one laptop series. The LG Gram series. If you see this anywhere. I'd easily choose it over any Asus or Huawei laptop being offered. Great display, amazing battery life. But alas it's pretty much impossible to find this in most stores. I live in Canada so I don't see it alot. But I haven't heard bad things about it.\n\n***C Tier***\n\nNow these laptops aren't bad, they're just good laptops, but nothing really special about them. But you should expect a decent laptop nonetheless. But unlike the B Tier, there should be some inconsistency to expect.\n\n**Samsung** has good laptops but I would easily choose a Huawei option over the Samsung. They offer the best displays on their laptop if you're ever deciding on it. Expect good hardware support from them. I wouldn't get anything that is not a Galaxy Book from this brand.\n\n**HP** dominates the budget market. This brand is either a Hit or Miss though and you gotta really look into the reviews of the laptop you're buying from them as their Support is like Acer... really bad. But overall they consistently deliver some of the best bang for your buck you can get.\n\n***D Tier***\n\nOnly one brand is on this list.\n\n**Acer** is known for budget laptops but the quality of the laptops are by far the worst. I've seen numerous people have issues with them, And their support is the worst out of any brand. Now in 2023, you can just easily buy a laptop from 2016 that would be better than what Acer is offering. I would stay away from this brand at all costs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you agree? Any changes you'd make? How accurate is my experience on this? ",
  "They are all made by the same Chinese ODMs and they have all made better and worse products over the years.",
  "Microsoft is definitely not s tier. More like b tier. They have hardware issues that can't be ignored. Surface is like a laptop that tries to do a lot without getting the basics quite right. Other than that, list is spot on. Apple is the only s tier laptop. Only complaint with Apple personally is I hate macos since I'm a windows user. Eben linux if fine. But I just hate using macos but I have to admit the macbook is just flawless itself aside from the time they put a laptop out with no usb port",
  "Hi there! Thank you so much for making an S tier list. I came all the way from google and got here. I have questions to ask.\n\nFirst of all, what tier do you think Toshiba would be part of (ignore the decline, think if it’s 2011)? Same for compaq\n\nAlso is there a site similar to Trivago/booking.com where I can filter laptop searches based on my favoured specifications and choose the right laptop? I personally want a high performance/gaming laptop \n\nAnd how good is Lenovo especially as a Chinese brand and what are some dell competitors/alternatives/version for HP pavilion, probook and elitebook(like ford Taurus and Chevy impala, Toyota Highlander and Nissan pathfinder)\n\nAnd what are some good brands for gaming laptop and High Performance/duty laptops?\n\nSorry for asking these questions since I’m no good with tech stuff and computer brands. \n\nI also have a review for HP, it is a big no no for me but I believe that pro book is ok. But I hate HP stuff like printers and laptops. Don’t know about peripherals.\n\nApple i believe is in a good quality and not sure if it has the same bullshit on their macs like to their iPhones (being purposely defunct and broken for the advantage of apple). Never used one but would like to buy it. ",
  "How about MSI?",
  "Lol Acer Predator Helios (Neo) series offers UNBEATABLE bang for  your buck and is WAY better than any similarly priced MSi crap (crappiest built gaming laptops for loong time). It is also better than TUF and some Lenovo \nbasic Legion / LOQ ones.\n\nI got my Helios 16 Neo for 1359 € (!!)\n\n- 240Hz 100% p3, 100% sRGB 2K\n- RTX4070\n- i9-14900HX (!!)\n- 32 Gb 5600Mhz RAM\n- 1TB NVMe SSD\n- etc.\n\n\n\n\nMy dad had an Acer aspire for 10 years and is still runs!",
  "including razer but not taking any of the gaming laptops from the major brands into consideration is an interesting choice. personally i'd swap huawei and HP. HP has a ton of laptops beyond just the budget range, such as their business laptops & spectre line. also take into mind that MS's tech support is quite mid, so they can't compare to Apple in that regard. their hardware is good though.\n\nrazer's great, but if you get a lemon, their tech support sucks.",
  "You are clearly a noob.  \n\n\nMicrosoft Surfaces have an ungodly amount of problems lol",
  "Yeah I used to hate macos until I got my M2 Pro Macbook Pro man... I love this thing. Literally my favourite laptop i've ever owned. Just flawless. And MacOS is a smooth OS, you gotta just try it, especially with now embedded AI its going to be nice. The apps are optimized for apple silicon nowadays so you get damn near perfect apps that are designed for its CPU. Only thing is gaming sucks on this. But most ppl who are able to afford this probably own a PS5 or Xbox . Once you go Apple you cant go back to windows lmao. They own my wallet now. Im about to get an iPad now lmao\n\nMy surface Laptop 13inch was by far the most productive laptop i've ever had. It was perfect for note taking with its touch display for when I had to draw diagrams, it was ultra portable, battery life was all day. It was my second favourite laptop I've ever owned. I havent had any hardware issues with it, maybe cause the laptop was an i5 chipset with no GPU.... Eh. I still stand with Microsoft being S Tier, that Surface Laptop is way better than a Macbook Air",
  "Toshiba in 2011 would be like A or B tier for sure. Now its like D lol. \n\n  \nLenovo is almost S Tier. I love thinkpads, highest quality laptops you could buy in terms of build quality, etc. \n\nFor laptops especially, never buy a new pavilion or whatever mid range laptop. Stay clear out of buying a new laptop for $500 range, instead buy an older flagship model like Dell XPS for the same price. You'll get pretty much all the new bells and whistles like display and nice graphics card, ram and storage. \n\nGaming Laptops are completely separate from High Performance laptops. \n\nMy Macbook Pro is a high performance laptop however, It's terrible for gaming. Its amazing for battery life, display, programming work etc. Does everything you need it to, and does it fast, but you cannot play games at high settings. Another example of a high performance laptop is like Lenovo Thinkpad Carbon, Dell XPS, Macbook Air/Pro. \n\nGaming Laptops are for gaming, and I would steer clear away from them because youd be sacrificing battery life, they tend to be heavy and not portable. But you can play games on it and do some intense graphics work like 3d rendering etc. But 99% of people dont do that. And I'd suggest to just get a ps5 or xbox if you really wanna game. And they depreciate like shit. Lol. Its better to just buy them used. You'd be saving alot of money. \n\nIn the laptop world there is no toyota highlander, their mid range laptops are total garbage that usually have cheap material, display, battery, etc. All of those metrics are important. But most of all they have terrible longevity. Especially on Windows.",
  "Yeah but for their business laptops there are far better options, and the spectre line is overpriced as hell \n\nI don't really think razor is a gaming laptop brand only, their good battery life, sleek design takes them out of that category into a unique brand of their own competing with any good laptop like the XPS or MacBook\n\nAlso if this was a gaming laptop brands only, this list will look like Razer at S Tier, Alienware at A Tier, Zephyrus at A Tier, Gigabyte B Tier, Acer B Tier... \n\nIdk why but I really hate Acer laptops as a brand in general there's always much better options",
  "HP is essentially Anti-Apple, complete opposite segments, strategy. \n\nI would never suggest an HP laptop brand new, depreciates like crazy so you can get them used",
  "Maybe it's just my experience with Microsoft laptops but fair enough.",
  "It may seem like im hating on gaming laptops, I've been through alienwares and all the gaming laptops, but if I had to get one it would be razer.",
  "Thank you for comprehensive information and advice. I currently own a MacBook Air m1 and planning to buy a MacBook Pro m3 this September/October while repurposing my MacBook Air as a travel laptop from former work laptop. \nThe reason for gaming laptop is because gaming laptops are special (something) than just practical/bland (in which practical is useless for me since I have a MacBook) and also to do heavy stuff like music production, video editing and gaming and whatever heavy duty I can do. Also like I’ve mentioned do we have a site for searching out perfect laptop.\n\nThe Toyota analogy was to compare/rival the Nissan pathfinder (you can see that part) same for dells alternative and hp laptops I’ve mentioned😂. ",
  "Asus Vivobook Flip14 vs Thinkpad X13 Gen 2 All the following models are second hand, with only 1 week warranty. The store has good reviews and is seasoned. I've always thought Thinkpads would've fit me. I love Thinkpads, it's heritage and design. I was on a tight budget back then hence I opt for older Thinkpad models- I've grown attached. I haven't had a model, but I damn think it would've been perfect for my college (BS Microbio here).\n\nNo another accessory function that I also looked for, aside from decent build quality, great keyboard, 1080p screen, i5 8th gen up, and 16gb ram, I also sought for the 2 in 1 functionality.

I actually like vivobook and zenbook build quality, especially their 14 inch models with metal chassis.

But ig practicality says buy the vivobook! Also concern for both too is the price, when my parents, who are going to buy the laptop for me, see the price and that there is no 1 year warranty, they'll go nuts. Hence, it's better if it were a lot cheaper.",
  "Galaxy Book 3 360 Series: Is it Worth the Hype and High Price Tag? My take on the 13\" Series  \n\nDear all,\n\nMy objective for this post is to share my interest in [the Galaxy Book series](https://www.samsung.com/uk/computers/all-computers/) (only the 13\" size and 360 series) and also looking for discussions with redditors who have their insights on this laptop. Before I start, a bit context, I did not buy the laptop but I owned S22 Ultra, S8 Ultra, a gaming laptop (Acer Nitro 5), and also both working and a part time student and been reviewing the series and considering to have one. Also, I am working in the UK where my first time I am exposed with Samsung Laptops, they didnt sell Samsung Laptop in my country.\n\nAs Samsung recently has launched their latest laptop series, I have gone through their technical specifications and been visiting my local stores to get the experience the device myself. As there already a lot of discussions on the technical aspect in other mediums, I think the main selling point for this Book 3 13\" series are the S-pen, AMOLED screen, SD card, battery life (18 hours) and Samsung Ecosystem. The Book 3 and 2 list (13\" display) are the following:-\n\n[Galaxy Book3 360 (13.3\", i7, 16GB)](https://www.samsung.com/uk/computers/galaxy-book/galaxy-book3-360-13-3-inch-with-s-pen-i7-16gb-512gb-np730qfg-kb1uk/) \\- GBP 1,399  \n[Galaxy Book3 360 (13.3\", i5, 8GB)](https://www.samsung.com/uk/computers/galaxy-book/galaxy-book3-360-13-3-inch-with-s-pen-i5-8gb-512gb-np730qfg-ka2uk/) \\- GBP 1,199  \n[Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 (13.3\", i7, 16GB) - GBP1,449](https://www.samsung.com/uk/computers/galaxy-book/galaxy-book2-pro-360-13inch-i7-16gb-512gb-np930qed-kh1uk/)  \n[Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 (13.3\", i7, 8GB)](https://www.samsung.com/uk/computers/galaxy-book/galaxy-book2-pro-360-13inch-i7-8gb-256gb-np930qed-kb3uk/) \\- X  \n[Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 (13.3\", i5, 8GB) - GBP1,119](https://www.samsung.com/uk/computers/galaxy-book/galaxy-book2-360-13inch-i7-16gb-512gb-np730qed-kb2uk/)  \n[Galaxy Book2 360 (13.3\", i7, 16GB)](https://www.samsung.com/uk/computers/galaxy-book/galaxy-book2-360-13inch-i7-16gb-512gb-np730qed-kb2uk/) \\- GBP 1,299  \n[Galaxy Book2 360 (13.3\", i5, 8GB) - X](https://www.samsung.com/uk/computers/galaxy-book/galaxy-book2-360-13inch-i5-8gb-256gb-np730qed-kb1uk/)\n\n**My first hand experience:** As a customer, when I visit my local store and get a hand of the latest Galaxy Book 3 360 13\" device, I think it is light, feels premium and the keyboard are pretty neat with backlight. I have been using [MX Logitech Keyboard](https://www.johnlewis.com/logitech-mx-keys-bluetooth-wireless-keyboard-black/p4801202?s_ppc=2dx92700075213305680_mixed_technology_SF&tmad=c&tmcampid=2&gclid=CjwKCAiAxvGfBhB-EiwAMPakqh6Ur28a7zLOg4xfIjPnktGPv8TZfTcEzrdniUSPb8je8gjo67HRTBoCg1sQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) and the S8 Ultra Keyboard, the experience are simply good and this keyboard share the similar quality, not too flimsy nor too cheap feeling like certain laptop. Using my S8 Ultra and S22 Ultra, I tested my stylus pen and amazingly it gives the same response (not sure on the palm rejection though) on the laptop.\n\n**I am deeply fall in love for this feature:**\n\n* The thing that makes me highly interested with the Galaxy Book 3 360 13\" are the **S pen,** **the touch and flipability** (360 feature), t**he SD card** and the potential of cross-devices experience delivered by the laptop\n* **18 hours of battery life.** Although some debates on the battery life, I find other redditors who optimized the battery through optimizing software and windows update, for me if it can sustain more than 10 hours it is already good\n* The **13\" size and weight**! it is much more portable and convenient in a lecture hall, train, workspace - compared with my gaming laptop and S8 Ultra.\n* **AMOLED screen and Dolby Atmos** \\- hands off the screen and sound is superb!\n* With **S Pen** I can take notes and do a lot of writing and let my S8 Ultra for reading use or second screen.\n* Although it is quite expensive with small storage, **the SD card slot** can be used as additional storage. I have used 1TB SD card for my S8 Ultra to date.\n* Most importantly, as a laptop it can run **Offices Desktop application**s and **install programming** (Python, R etc) where I heavily use as a student - not applicable for tablet!\n* Other than that, **Samsung Ecosystem** (especially Samsung Notes, Flow) and is pretty streamlined across the devices, I can simply use my phone stylus cross devices, and jot down notes. Say you have another touch screen laptop to use (need different pen and response is different).\n\n**The thing I hate the most:** The only thing that hold me from buying the laptop is\n\n* **the price:** as shown - the major limiting factor. The predecessor are still expensive to be purchased too!\n* **the hardware:** only a 8GB RAM, i5 processor with 256GB SSD for the base device. For such a price I believe it you might got a better laptop offer that has 16GB, i7 processor and at least 512GB-1TB SSD with integrated graphics.\n* Only 60Hz **refresh rate???** \\- should have 120Hz as standard across the new laptop\n\n**Other things that I value, not so important but sometimes I consider:**\n\n* **HDMI port:** I am surprised there are still a lot of issues for presentation in the UK (just recently migrated), be it university or working environment. HDMI cable still relevant and thanks Samsung for still keeping it\n* **Thunderbolt charging:** Coming from a gaming laptop and gaming desktop user perspective, having a small battery charger are more minimalistic and organized on the go.\n* **USB port:** 1 USB type C and 1 USB 3.2 - I think by having at least 2 ports of different types in a slim device are pretty good bargain - Gaming laptop (too much ports), Tablet (no port, only Type C)\n* **Audiojack:** Samsung somehow keep the 3.2pi HP/MIC jack, pretty useful I think especially lots of quality mic are still the old one requiring audiojack.\n* **MicroSD slot:** Having extra storage or SD slot is important, pretty useful to allocate storage esp for video editor, or ifneed for data transfer\n* **Keyboard with backlight:** I am pretty used to my gaming dynamic RGB colour keyboard. So when purchasing I usually find keyboard with backlight, even when buying wireless keyboard. Sometimes lectures and conferences are in dark hall, having a backlight is super important.\n\nTLDR: I still hesitated to buy this device and hope Samsung could keep this device at lower price, better basic hardware (16GB RAM with at least 512GB SSD) and expand the Pro series to have its own 13\" size as well. The stylus pen, AMOLED screen, 13\" size, Windows OS with native desktop Office, lightweight, Samsung ecosystem, good keyboard with backlight are the selling point for me. As there are some documented reviews on Galaxy Book 2 battery and heating issues, I think I will focus on Galaxy 3 360 series.\n\nAnyone would like to share their insights as well? Appreciate the response!",
  "Which laptop is better? Hi! I am looking into buying a new laptop, and I am not sure which one to get. I'd primarily use the laptop for work (Excel, etc. Nothing too computationally expensive) and leisure (movies, series). It would be great if the laptop could handle low-end games, but that is not a priority.   \n\n\nI'd like at least an i5 core and 16GB RAM, and I have been recommended to choose either Lenovo or Asus due to reliability, so these are the options I'm looking at: \n\n1.

  "Advice in Finding a Good, Cheap Laptop This really isn't saying anything on finding specific brands, but more on how to find major brands for a low price and what to do when looking for them. Anyone can feel free to put in their own buying advice.\n\nIf you don’t mind getting a used one, eBay would be the best choice in finding a cheap, good quality laptop under $300. Maybe first try for ones around the $150-$250 range with the amount of storage and RAM you want, then lowering the prices until you can find a suitable one with an affordable price. For brands, your best choices would be HP, Dell, and Lenovo, and possibly Acer too. Asus may seem like a good choice to steer towards because of the price, but there are a lot of bad reviews and complaints over the brand so is better to just avoid it instead of getting a dirt-cheap laptop that starts breaking down within a year. \n\nOut of the 4, HP of course is the priciest and the most modern-looking and arguably has the best quality. It probably would be the best bet, but it'll take some time searching to be able to find a good, affordable one. It is possible though, I purchased an HP one with 1 TB storage, 8 gb of RAM, and a 15.6-inch screen, even touchscreen, for $250. \n\nLenovo is the best for both price and quality, can't complain with them since they lower prices to around $200 easy. Expect to see the majority being sold to be thinkbooks with a screen smaller than 15 inches.\n\nDell is the most notable for its durability, even the more modern looking ones are usually a little thicker than other brands. Quality rivals HP to an extent and prices are almost always lower too.\n\nCan't say too much about Acer since I have very little experience with the brand, but they significantly lower the price range down to the $125 - $150, but you may or may not find the quality to be as good, though I can't say for sure.\n\nFor storage 500 Gigs would be a good place to start since, you definitely wouldn't be hurting for storage anytime soon even if even it frequently with programs that are really big in size. Even several 'space-hogging' programs like several heavy-duty games wouldn't fill up the storage too quickly. I'm not sure how many of those programs you'll need but it seems a more comfortable than having 256 GB and constantly cutting down on file size, so it doesn't fill up too quickly.\n\nGetting everything, you want in a laptop with a high amount of RAM can be touch because 4GB is the standard and the overwhelming majority at a lower price range but would most likely be a poor choice to go with. Most programs may need that as the base requirement, but to have them all actually run well, you'll definitely be needing more. At 8 gb, the prices wouldn't be bumped up too much, and would only go up a little more at 12 gb, though those ones won't be as common. 16 gb of RAM would be ideal but good luck finding a nice, modern, in shape laptop with that much memory around $200. I wouldn’t say impossible, but very difficult, nonetheless. \n\nPersonally, I'd say that memory takes a bit more priority over a lot of storage; a 1 TB hard drive wouldn't be so desirable if by the time you’re using 1/3 of your total storage space, the laptop starts getting terribly slow because the laptop has only 4 GB of memory which can handle only so many programs at a time. You could always buy more, but that’s an additional +$30 cost you could have already originally gotten with the laptop in the first place. \n\nSo when searching online on eBay:\n\n· Have a set of attributes you want the MOST in the laptop and let that be the guidelines in finding which ones to narrow it down to. Also save a search in eBay so you can always come back to the search daily or even a couple of times a day to see if other ones are available\n\n· Keep note of every laptop you come across that fits that list to compare them to each other later in a spreadsheet to see where you can get the most bang for your buck\n\n· Even if the description says that a laptop has a certain feature, make sure to ask the seller. Often, they'll just take the list of specs online of a laptop that's very similar in name in its series (like DS-707 when it’s a DS-704 or something) and put it in the description which the buyer will assume is correct\n\n· It's safer to look for ones that can be returned within a time period since there is no guarantee that the laptop will be satisfactory. If one is not available, there usually is a warranty fee that covers any purchases that don’t offer refunds that can be taken up. If those aren't available, there’s always the money back guarantee that eBay offers if the laptop isn’t up to par after purchase, most people aren’t willing to risk getting a bad mark on their reputation, so they’ll usually cooperate if you explain what is wrong with the laptop and that you’d like a refund.\n\nLastly, the price and availability of a Chromebook may seem tempting, but the laptop has many downfalls. My school had those to borrow out to students and I got to use one frequently for my daily commute to see what the fuss was about. Basically, why it starts up so quickly is that it is completely and entirely centralized around Google and Chrome, and as a result gets rid of all other standard programs, alternative browsers, and email apps can be found or at least downloaded easily onto a laptop, making the user find workarounds if they want to use them instead. And everything requires having an internet connection to even access those features, even using a word processor, which was terrible for someone on near 2-hour commute with no internet to use something that doesn’t need the internet in the first place. It’s a little better now than it was then, but still not best if you’re not online most of the time. Another thing it trying to use any external drive operate with its cloud-based storage since again, the user is expected to have a google email, and practically only use that one, to manage any data the computer processes. It’s nothing short of frustrating trying to just put files on a flash drive and be done with it instead and everything being on the internet in case one is in a situation where they may not have internet access. All these inconveniences just don’t make it worth it in my opinion. \n\nTL;DR : Finding a laptop you'll be satisfied with would mean having the most high-end features, desirable attributes, a comfortable to high number of GB for storage and memory, and with a condition that's in such good shape, that even if the laptop's used, its practically like new. This can be found in a used one on eBay for around $200 no matter which brand you end up choosing if you know how to look.",
  "What are the best laptops for a college student with long battery life? I know that MacBooks are popular and have long better life’s but i think it is too expensive and the bigger the screen the more expensive it is and the intel core is kinda bad for the price. \n\nI want to get a hp laptop but a lot of the hp laptops have a low battery life. Which hp laptop has the best battery life that can last for several hours?",
  "[Help] Acer Swift 3 SF314-52 (Used) vs. ASUS ZenBook UX330UA (Used) I'm having a hard time figuring out which ultrabook to get given the price points I've found on them, so I was hoping for some insight. Here's some background info...\n\nI originally started my quest with an assumed budget of ~$300. I realized that was impractical so now I'm simply trying to find the best bang for my buck, but circling closer to a max of ~$450. I never intended to buy new, so used or refurbished is fine...to an extent.\n\nI found a used Acer Swift 3 (SF314-52, not -51. Difference lies in the SDD technology, I think. -51 uses M.2, -52 uses PCIe IIRC) for $420 on eBay.\n\nSlightly-less uses ASUS ZenBook UX330UA's go for almost $600, and brand-new they're $700.\n\nBoth have an Aluminum build, but the ASUS is thinner and lighter.\n\nThe Swift beats the ZenBook in some performance aspects (SSD is faster due to PCIe, processor is the same), but the screen is dim, glossy, and the battery life is shorter (~7hrs vs ~10 hrs). Every review I've read has given the edge to the ASUS, and as an ASUS fanboy myself, I have a hard time of letting go (currently still running an old G74SX and it's great).\n\n**OR** should I consider the -51 series of Swift 3's? They have a matte screen, a 6th gen Core i5, and similar battery life.\n\nPrimary criterion for these choices is: portability, long-ish battery life, and intended use for school (writing reports, taking notes in class, writing code - I can execute code on my more powerful computer at home).\n\nCan someone please set me straight? Slap in the face? Something? Thank you.",
  "> Light, good battery\n\nAll right. \n\n\n> School\n\n\nSo I assume a good keyboard.\n\n\n\nLook, man, ask yourself - is the extra 3 hours of battery life and matte screen and a slower SSD worth the extra $? If yes, the Asus. If no, the Acer.",
  "Asus has a better rep too than acer ",
  "\"slower ssd\". Does the nvme speed boost really make a difference anywhere beyond benchmarks?",
  "I know. I've been an ASUS fan since I had an AMD K6-2 400 MHz CPU mounted onto one of their MB's, lol. I would like to take that into consideration, but I need to remain as objective as possible.",
  "No, it's nigh unnoticeable irl.",
  "[This](https://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/acer-swift-3-review/) review seems to indicate otherwise in their CrystalDiskMark tests. Read speeds were more than 2x that of the ZenBook, but write speeds only ~25% faster. I imagine that might show up in boot time, opening programs, etc.",
  "It's not as noticeable as the difference between HDD and SSD, I should have said. You are absolutely correct and so is that review.",
  "As I mentioned, \"except in benchmarks\". I only use an older sata3 SSD, and as far as I can tell it's not the bottleneck for anything hence doubling its speed wouldn't speed anything up. ",
  "Aaah that makes more sense. Like ngoonee said though, if the M.2 is not already the bottleneck, then I won't see much of a gain by opting for the PCIe version. However, the used -52 (with PCIe) is still cheaper than all the used -51's I've found. Not sure what that implies, though...",
  "Ah. Missed that.  Well it seems to be moot right now anyway because, oddly enough, all of the used -51 Swift 3's I've found are actually more expensive than this particular used -52. ",
  "Is the Lenovo 330s a good replacement for my old MacBook pro? I had a MacBook pro 13\" 2018 no touch bar since last August which I was pretty happy with but, a series of unfortunate events ended in me having to sell it for parts due to an accident that couldn't be fixed. I am still in quite a lot of debt for this laptop and have been looking for a cheaper replacement that can fulfill my needs. I am a recent design graduate and require a laptop that will be able to run photoshop and indesign smoothly (light/medium use) for my illustration work.\n\nYesterday I bought a Lenovo 330s from John Lewis after having spent hours looking at other laptops and considering more expensive options (like the Lenovo Yoga), I settled on the 330 because the screen resolution looked good, the build felt decent and the specs seemed promising. It has an intel core i5 processor, 8gb RAM and 128GB SSD (here is a link to the product: [https://www.johnlewis.com/lenovo-ideapad-330s-81f400e9uk-laptop-intel-core-i5-8gb-128gb-ssd-14-inch-full-hd-grey/p3655313#product-detail--reviews](https://www.johnlewis.com/lenovo-ideapad-330s-81f400e9uk-laptop-intel-core-i5-8gb-128gb-ssd-14-inch-full-hd-grey/p3655313#product-detail--reviews))\n\nOn many websites this laptop has been categorised as an 'everyday' laptop, for surfing the web, writing e-mails and streaming videos, however I have noticed that some of the laptops that are more expensive and considered 'premium' have the same or similar specs, only more bells and whistles which I don't need (finger touch log-in, touch screen, backlit keyboard, etc). Shall I stick with the Lenovo 330s or do you think my photoshop tasks will be asking too much from this humble device? Or should I return it and spend a few more hundred on a premium laptop like the Asus Zenbook?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;",
  "There's a slight issue with the 330s if you're planning on doing graphic design - it has a very mediocre screen [sRGB coverage](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-IdeaPad-330S-15IKB-i5-8250U-UHD620-Laptop-Review.332226.0.html#toc-display-ideapad-330s-with-a-full-hd-panel), i.e. the amount of colours that can be reproduced by the screen. sRGB is considered the \"consumer\" standard, and AdobeRGB is the \"professional\" standard, of which it only covers 38%. This means anything you do involving colours will not be possible, since a lot of them simply won't look any different from one another on that screen. Unless you have (or buy) a desktop monitor that has the proper colour space coverage, I'd go with a more premium laptop. Things like screen or speaker quality are why a lot of premium laptops are more expensive than regular laptops, even if they share internals.\n\nEdit: A good example of a laptop with excellent screen colour space is the [ThinkPad X1 Carbon](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-2018-WQHD-HDR-i7-Laptop-Review.284682.0.html#toc-display-wqhd-with-dolby-vision-hdr), although it is very expensive. I recommend using notebookcheck.net to find out about display values, their tests are usually quite accurate.",

  "No, none at all, although I've had issues with low colour-space coverage screens before.",
  "Gigabyte Aero 15x The Gigabyte Aero 15x is an overall great laptop. \n\nPrior to purchasing this laptop, I did some research and through some friend's recommendation I decided to purchase the Gigabyte Aero 15x. I was still skeptical on how great this laptop can be for and I just paid a hefty sum for it. Upon opening the box and actually holding the laptop, I was surprise on how light it was. It is still 4.5lbs, but for all the hardware that is inside the laptop, Its considerably right. I also do like how it feels as I touch it with my hand. The hinge on the laptop is quite nice and sturdy. The only design complaint i have is that the webcam is positioned in a very awkward area, but it does give the monitor the great bezeless feel\n\nThe laptop has an amazing monitor. The 15 inch 1080p 144hz monitor looks fantastic. I was amazed on how crisp and sharp the image was. I never thought this was possible on a laptop, but here I am using it. It booted up very fast and the you can load programs pretty fast. It was also great that it didnt come with too many bloatware, so I didnt have to waste time uninstalling.\n\nAfter setting up and booting the laptop, I do recommend updating all the drivers. It will help the laptop run smoother. \n\nAfter using the laptop for a bit and playing Players Unknown Battleground, there are some pros and cons I would like to point out. \n\nPros: The display is amazing, its even better than the monitor I currently use with my PC setup (AOC G2460PQU). It can run PUBG on high settings at 60+ FPS. Even when the fan is running, its not extremely quiet, but its a lot quieter than you would expect it to be since its running at GTX 1070. This laptop also runs lightning fast. I am amazed at how fast it can boot up and load programs. The battery life is also amazing. You would expect a poor battery life since its running a GTX 1070, but I can keep it unplugged for hours before having to charge it. Having a long battery life is a big plus for me, as I am always on the move and needing it to run Photoshop and Autocad. Gigabyte was also considerate enough to allow us to expand our memory and ram. Instead of providing 2x 8GB ram sticks, they only used 1x 16GB ram stick, and there are 2 slots which I will be taking advantage of in the future. They also provided an M.2 SSD 512GB, and also gave us a free M.2 SSD slot, so if you need more memory, there is no need for an external harddrive.\n\nCons: The trackpad is the bane of this laptop. Prior to purchasing this laptop, I was using the macbook air, and the Aero 15x trackpad is no where comparable. I had to install the lenovo trackpad driver for this laptop to make it more bearable. This makes the trackpad more macbook like, but still inferior and it takes sometime getting used to. The keyboard feels nice, and I am a sucker for RGB, but its too compact. I am still adapting to the keyboard and learning how to type much more efficiently with it. I am always misclicking and whatnot. I know its an expensive laptop, and it feels like they want to give you the option of having everything a desktop would have, but I think the number pad is excessive. On my desktop, I barely use the number pad, so i would prefer to rid of the number pad and expand the keyboard so it does not feel so cramped. \n\nDespite having 2 big flaws in my book, I am overall happy with the this laptop. It does everything I need it to do and more. All the pros outweigh the cons in my book. Would I recommend this laptop to anyone? Of course. As of right now, I dont think are any true competition for this laptop. There are other Max-Q Series by Asus, Aorus, Razer, and MSI. Aesthically, I think the others have better designs, but the Gigabyte Aero 15x won me over with its long battery life.\n\nRecommend: 9.5/10.0\nDesign: 8.5/10.0\nSpeed: 10.0/10.0\nOverall: 9.5/10.0\n\n",
  "I hate to shit on your review, but what exactly are you providing here? It just seems like you're rehashing the same things you find in every review, providing little numbers / stats as opposed to \"It can run PUBG on high settings at 60+ FPS\". You completely ignore the fact that 1x16GB means you aren't getting dual channel memory., and you claim the fans are \"quieter than you'd expect from a 1070\" when it's known that the Aero 15X is the loudest of the new laptops.  \n\nAlso,  \n>As of right now, I dont think are any true competition for this laptop.  \n\nLet's not get silly.  ",
  "Thanks for the review. I'm replacing my AW13R3 with an Aero15x very soon.\n\nThe keyboard is my only concern (the AW had an awful trackpad that also needed precision drivers in order to make workable). I'm a software engineer so I type a lot and if I can't adjust it'll be a showstopper.",
  "Best laptop atm. Let’s the haters come!!",
  "How the hell do i get my hands on the Aero 15x in northern Europe?",
  "The single channel ram thing seems to be happening with more than just the Aero15x, I've read reviews from other new laptops which are also shipping with 1 stick of 16gig. \n\nThe real world performance difference for the vast majority of people is roughly 5%. Yes you can find benchmarks that will show larger performance difference but *most* people don't use these sorts of workloads.",
  "What's up? Bad day?",
  "Razer vs Sager vs MSI I'm looking for a new laptop to replace my aging macbook pro, and wanted to get your advice on some choices that I've narrowed it down to. I'll put the form, then briefly explain my situation.\n\n* **Total budget and country of purchase:** \n$2,250, USA\n\n* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** \nBest specifications for my requirements with decent battery life. \n\n* **How important is weight to you?**\nSomewhat important\n\n* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**\nWindows or Mac\n\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** \n15 in, would consider 13-14 in.\n\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** \nGraphics-intensive gaming, biochemical modeling\n\n* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** \nDark Souls 3, Witcher 3, Overwatch, Fallout 4, heavily modded Skyrim. I want to be able to run the latest games at ~60 fps at max settings, but I could settle with high settings.\n\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** \nBiggest priority is on getting a high, solid build quality. I would also want a good trackpad, a decent keyboard, and a decent display (preferably glossy, but I'll take matte).\n\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**\n\nI've only ever had MacBooks for laptops, so they've left me with a penchant for sleek machines with a high build quality and a good trackpad. I want my new laptop to be similar and to have at least a GTX 1060 but preferably a 1070. I'm fine with FHD, but if I can play max settings at 60 fps with QHD or UHD, I'll take that instead. Most of all, I need it to be professional-looking and discreet because I'll be using it for work as well (no Asus ROG or Alienware). \n\nThese are the main ones I'm considering, along with my concerns:\n\nThe upcoming razer blade sounds perfect for me. However, I'm concerned that I won't be able to run games at max quality because of the QHD+ display and the presence of the 1060 instead of 1070. I've also heard that heat and noise were a major problem with previous razer generations. I'd have to put a cover on the back to hide the logo. Do you think this laptop will be able to handle the latest games at max settings?\n\nAnother option is the Sager NP8153S. It looks to have great power, looks decently thin, and is professional-looking. However, I've heard that Sager doesn't have the best build quality and has so-so trackpads.\nhttp://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np8153s-clevo-p650rs.html\n\nThe last one I'm looking at is one of the MSI GS series, like this one:\nhttp://www.xoticpc.com/msi-gs63vr-stealth-pro-034.html\nI'd have to cover up the back like with the razer. I've also heard that MSI laptops don't have great build quality.\n\nWhat have your experiences been with the thermals, trackpads, build qualities, and \"feel\" of these brands' thinner laptops or their predecessors, especially the Sager? Which would you personally recommend for me? Do you guys think I should wait until more reviews come out? Are there other models I've missed that fit my requirements?",
  "If you like MacBooks, the Razer is literally a black MacBook Pro with Windows that games. \n\nIt's going to have the build quality and feel to the touch that you're used to. \n\nAs for heat and fan noise, that's common on all gaming laptops. It's less on an issue on a 2\" thick 17.3\" Sager behemoth because you're working with a much larger surface are to dissipate heat and you can plug in much larger fans. \n\nThe Sager one you linked to is thick, outdated looking (blocky, angular corners, chunky) and plastic all around. Coming from a mac you'll notice the build differences immediately. But if you go with a Rzaer, the build quality is identical to the Mac. \n\nAs for the MSI, they're thin like the Razer but lack the per-key RGB lighting that looks so good on Razer and Aorus. They're made from very thin aluminum and plastic, rather than being milled from a single block of aluminum like Macs, Razer, Dell's XPS line, ASUS' Zenbook UX306, etc. There's an immediately noticeable difference in the build. One of the MSI's I looked at at Fry's last week had the screen bezel literally coming apart at the seams. This is something that happened to my Sager back in the day. ",
  "I am in a similar situation. I think the upcoming razer blade is probably the best option. Like you I worry about it being a 1060 instead of a 1070, but I am not willing to sacrifice portability, battery life, and clean aesthetics. More details on the blade will be out on 9/2 I believe so I'm just waiting for that.\n\nI have a MSI GS70 stealth, an older GS series laptop. Don't really have a glowing recommendation. Build is not great. Definitely lacking the polish of a Blade or Macbook. \n\nDunno about Sager. They look way bulky though",
  "between the atrocious screen (unless you go 4k which makes it a 2000 equal to razer) and the power on the right and the brick size I just can't go with the stealth. I've handled it twice and I'm just not willing to live with the build quality. If I am spending 2000 its on a blade. After 20 years on macs I just can't buy an MSI as they stand",
  "Ultrabook keyboard quality (Asus Zenbook, Dell XPS 13) Hi! After 5 years, my Asus G74SX is showing its age, with barely any battery left and lacking performance in recent games.\n\nHaving in the meantime acquired a desktop gaming PC, I am therefore looking to replace it with something smaller -- ideally, something I can carry around every day and use in the subway on my way to work. With a budget of around 1500 CAD and a need to run music software (Reaper and a moderate number of VSTs), I'm looking at Ultrabook form-factor computers (ideally with Kaby Lake chips) such as the Asus Zenbook and Dell XPS 13 series.\n\nDespite how expensive it was at the time, the G74SX wasn't a great laptop because Asus cut corners at crucial components: the wi-fi chip was atrocious (replaced it, no big deal), the trackpad incredibly mediocre (and its driver even worse), and the keyboard was, by far, the worst I've ever used on any device this side of the ZX-80. It used unstabilized rubber domes, giving each key an extremely wobbly, unresponsive feeling that made typing on it a very displeasurable activity.\n\nI mean, sure, I was carrying around a 12-pound laptop and a mouse, so I might as well lug around a Pok3r with it, right?\n\nStill. It's a mistake I don't want to repeat (and this time, actual portability matters). Manufacturer websites for the aforementioned candidates are remarkably quiet about keyboard technologies beyond \"yes, this computer definitely has one [and it's backlit but seriously, who cares about that]\". Reviews have so far been unhelpful.\n\n**TL;DR:** Do you know what keyboard tech is behind the Zenbook, XPS, Spectre, Thinkpad X, Surface Book, etc. series? Unstabilized rubber domes? Scissor switches? Please let it be scissor switches, they're the membrane tech that sucks the least?\n\n[EDIT] Not completely sure whether this should be flaired \"buying advice\" or \"general discussion\". Mods, feel free to edit if you think the one I picked is inappropriate.",
  "Zenbook 3 has a pretty shallow keyboard, but you'll get used to it, and it feels pretty tactile for what it is. Better than the Macbook imo.\n\nXPS 13 has a really solid keyboard, and the Thinkpad X1C is probably the top pick of the laptops you've listed.\n\nThey're all pretty good though - I would highly consider the XPS 13 and X1C, as well as Surfacebook.",
  "Noted, thank you. The Kaby Lake refresh of the XPS 13 looks promising indeed. It's just sad that no matter what I buy I'll have to immediately wipe and reinstall Windows to get rid of all the crapware, but I'm used to that by now.",
