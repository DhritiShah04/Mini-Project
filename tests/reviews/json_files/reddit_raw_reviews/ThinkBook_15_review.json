  "My brief review of MSI Modern 15 A11MU Greetings!\n\ntl;dr I am not going to write repetitive stuff which you can read in NoteBookCheck or LaptopMedia. Good laptop for the price. I like it. The only complaint is how loud the fans are.\n\n**Body:**\n\nThere are flexes in the lid and chassis of the laptop, but I think that's fine. Fingerprint magnet. It is lightweight and easy to carry around.\n\n**Display:**\n\nIt is a 50% sRGB panel, but a good one. I like it. Colors aren't washed out like my old HP ENVY k209ne, good contrast ratio and brightness. There are no problems using it indoors (I usually using it at 80 or 90% brightness), and some outdoor usage will be fine.\n\n**Inputs:**\n\nDecent touchpad. Accurate and supports gestures. A bit small though.\n\nVery good keyboard. Func keys are really good. Disabling webcam, touchpad, mic, changing user scenario and so on. There is also a Fn + ESC to switch to normal Func keys. 3 level backlight is bright and good.\n\n**Upgradability:**\n\nYou have 2 slots for M2 SSD which is really nice. The same goes for RAM. I love upgradability on laptops.\n\n**Battery:**\n\nThe battery size is small compared to the laptop's size. I preferred sth around 70 to 90 Wh, but you get what you pay for. 53 Wh battery can last 4 to 5 hours (if 100%) in case of web browsing, watching youtube or movies, doing Office work and light stuff like that. The charging speed is really good too. It gets from 30% to 80% less than an hour.\n\n**Software:**\n\nThere is MSI Center Pro. It lets you set max charge capacity, different user scenarios, fan speed, update drivers, diagnostics, battery calibration and some other stuff which is nice to have.\n\n**Speed:**\n\nFast laptop (compared to 2 core i5 5200u). No lags or slowness. Gets the job done.\n\n**Gaming:**\n\nI don't game with this laptop, so I can't say anything about it. But the laptop is always cool and CPU package temp is lower than 30 in college work like using Proteus, coding, office, web browsing, multitasking and so on.\n\n**Ports:**\n\nYou have everything you need except goddamn rj45 which is cringe not having it\n\n**Linux:**\n\nNo problems so far with Mint. Everything works as expected.\n\n**Complaints:**\n\nMy only complaint is fan speed. The base fan speed is 3000 RPM which is noisy. You can't concentrate. Fans on this laptop are strong and can go to 6000 RPM, but 3000 RPM while being idle? NO that's not good. You can lower the fan speed to 2200 RPM which is way more acceptable and quieter in MSI Center Pro -> Advanced User Scenario, but that will be for Windows. Fans are sometimes noisy and sometimes quiet in Linux which is sus and cringe at the same time. There may be some Bios updates in the future.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\nGreat laptop for the price. You will get a decent display, acceptable battery, fast CPU and two fans. Fan noise is high, but it can be fixed. I recommend it.",
  "Here's the [13th Gen Modern 14 review](https://highperformancelaptops.com.au/reviews/msi-modern-14-review) btw",
  "Im planning to buy Modern 15 B7M (are they significantly different?), would you still recommend it?\n\nAlso, is it compatible with linux? Im a beginner so please dont any studip questions, although i ask a lot of them.",
  "Hello is this laptop a good choice if you're using CAD and google sketchup? I work as a draftsman and these are the two programs I always work with",
  "Hello\n\nI can't recommend Modern 15 B7M, because I don't own one. At a glance I can say it has one less fan, plastic build and soldered memory compared to my model. Go for 16GB version.\n\nFor the second question you must search for CPU model to check if it is compatible or not. Keep this in mind that most of the CPUs are compatible with Linux nowadays.",
  "You should check minimal hardware requirements for CAD especially GPU and CPU. Check if integrated graphics is suitable for your case or not (which I guess isn't.)",
  "Where did you find those details, about fans and building material? Im new to all this so please mind my stupid queations.   \\\nI juat found out that there are 2 varients of modern 15 ryzen 7 16gb/512gb -  B7M and C7M, how do i compare these two?\n\nTheres a video on youtube saying linux runs on msi 14 smoothly, so im assuming itd be the same fir other varients too.\n\nAnd thanks for replying",
  "All of my jobs are just floor plans and I read somewhere that the graphics card isn't really all that important unless you need rendering done. Is that true?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's 8GB of RAM (which I heard it the minimum you need for Autocad) and you can upgrade to 16. The processor is I7 which I think is okay. What do you think?",
  "Please don't call your questions stupid. It makes me uncomfortable. ;))\n\nHere is a link about MSI Modern 15 BX review: [link](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/msi-modern-15) \n\nIt is about B12, but I think it's the same for B7, because they use same chassis.\n\nAlso you can find specs here about [B7](https://www.msi.com/Business-Productivity/Modern-15-B7X/Specification) and [C7](https://www.msi.com/Business-Productivity/Modern-14-C7X/Specification). I think the **7** part suggest they are AMD based (Intel baseds are sth like B12 or A11). I guess C7 is 14 inch, right?",
  "I think this laptop supports up to 64Gb of RAM, so no problem there. It depends. The i7 is not the H series on gaming laptops with higher TDPs and 6 or 8 cores. It is a U series which is designed for lighter tasks with 4 cores. You must search and see if this CPU and iGPU suits you or not. I don't have any experience with those softwares, so I can't give any definite answers.",
  "Thanks. I really do need to stop degrading myself.\n\nWhat i make out of these reviews is that \n* msi modern has plastic built yet sturdy\n* has no lan port (should that be a deal breaker? My dorm offers high speed lan connection. Wifi is ok-ish)\n* excellent performanve and battery life\n* poor cooling system\n\nAm i wrong about any of these?\n\nAnd thanks, this has been very helpful.",
  "Ok thank you so much!",
  "I haven't read those reviews, but those can be true (mostly). Lack of RJ45 is a pain yes. Battery life is dependent on your usage. Go for bigger battery model if available. Cooling system is task dependent too. In normal use, day to day life it won't be a problem, but gaming or other stressful tasks are a different story. That's it. If it suits you, go for it!",
  "I decided i will for something with better ports even if i need to comromise on performance. But thanks tho, this convo didnt turn out to be pointless. I actually learned a lot. Thank you fellow stranger :)",

  "Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 15 review! Amazing display only wish it was 16:10! Here’s my review of the brand new Samsung Galaxy Book Pro. It’s AMOLED display is absolutely stunning and is the best I’ve ever used on a laptop. It just about makes up for the lower than average brightness and absence of 16:10 in my opinion, but personal taste will apply here! \n\nThe 1165G7 CPU performs much better than the equivalent in the LG Gram 14 and the weight of the think has to be felt to believe it!\n\nAll round great package! \n\nHow much important is it for you to have the ultra lightest laptop possible? \n\nhttps://youtu.be/W8hbBxm_Kqc",
  "I really love this device.. I just wish they made it more like surface pro x so it could be more portable",
  "Only thing I do not like about the Samsung is the big chunky bezel on the bottom. If it had thin bezels all around I would have gotten the samsung...",
  "Sure, see what you’re saying, but in grand scheme of things it’ll feel basically as portable!",
  "I think that’s an inevitable consequence of needing a larger base chassis so they can accommodate battery/cooling systems. The whole issue would be resolved by a 16:10 aspect ratio to fill that unused space! 2022 let’s see what they do",
  "Review: This $320 Laptop Really Impressed- ASUS VivoBook 15.6\" **ASUS VivoBook 15.6\"**\n\nModel: **F512DA-WH31**\n\nI purchased this laptop at Walmart. [At the time of writing this review it sits at $320 USD](https://www.walmart.com/ip/ASUS-VivoBook-15-6-FHD-Display-AMD-Ryzen-3-3200U-4GB-DDR4-128GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-in-S-mode-Slate-Gray-F512DA-WH31/700011839?comm-msg-vehicle=EMAIL&comm-msg-id=5ee2337f-2277-4ce5-81c1-a70a04eb6afa)\n \n\n**Let's start with the specs:**\n\n* AMD Ryzen 3 3200U\n* 4GB DDR4 (Soldered, but upgradeable)\n* 128GB SSD (SATA)\n* 15.6\" Screen (TN) 1920x1080\n\nSo, for the price that's a decent chunk of hardware. No, it's not going to blow minds, but it's certainly passable. For background: I was looking for a companion laptop to use around the house in addition to my normal workstation. This seemed to fit the bill so I pulled the trigger.\n\n\n**CPU:**\n\n* 2C/4T\n* Clockspeed: 2.6 GHz\n* Turbo Speed: 3.5 GHz\n\nOne of my main concerns with this laptop was going to be cooling and throttling. Especially looking under the hood at the cooling solution they implemented. BUT... Wow.. It's does absolutely fine. Running AIDA64 it held it's turbo boost the entire time. Temps went up to around 85 with a brief spike at 88. Turbo never strayed from the 3.5GHz.  I'm shocked honestly. \n\n \n\n**Memory:** \n\nSo out of the box there is 4GB 2600mhz soldered to the board. There is, however, an open SODIMM slot that allows an additional 8GB DIMM to be installed. I opted to drop an additional 4GB stick (rather than an 8GB) to maintain dual channel. So.. while expandability is there, you are limited with possible detriments if you break the dual channels. \n\n**Storage:**\n\nThey kinda cut corners here with opting for a 128GB SATA drive rather than a NVME. It's easily upgradable however so you could replace the SATA m.2 with an NVME one if you so choose. \n\nThere is also an open 2.5\" bay for a traditional SSD or HDD if you needed additional storage. \n\n \n**Screen:** \n\nThis is where the price of this laptop really shows it's face. The TN panel's viewing angles are... Well they are terrible. ESPECIALLY vertical viewing angles. \n\nColor is passable when looking at just the right angle. Otherwise, it's the worst part about this laptop. I wouldn't recommend this laptop if you are looking for a media machine.\n\nI will say, they did an excellent job with the small boarders. The form factor of the monitor is quite nice even if the panel isn't the best.\n\n**Keyboard & Trackpad:**\n\nIt's....... fantastic. Honestly, this might be one of the best chiclet keyboard's I have ever used. While I wish there was a bit more travel to the keys, they feel responsive and typing is a breeze. Key stabilization is very good. The spacing is a bit odd, especially on the top row (F keys - Delete) The addition of a full numpad is always welcome. \n\nThe trackpad is large enough and responsive. Not the best when compared to high end laptops, but certainly when considering the price, it's very good.\n\n**Operating System:**\n\nI had to make a comment about this. The computer ships with Windows 10 S for some reason. It's easy enough to to go into the activation settings and move it into Windows Home for free.\n\nThere is a bit of bloatware installed, but not enough to make me want to reinstall the OS. A few minutes of uninstalling application takes care of that. \n\nOh.. and I almost forgot to mention. WINDOWS HELLO IS INCLUDED. Fingerprint scanner is integrated into the trackpad. A+\n \n**WiFi:**\n\nHey! The addition of a genuine Intel wireless chip is nice! (Intel 8265ngw)\n\n**Battery Life:** \n\n*I will update this review with battery life when I have had a bit more time with the computer to get a sense.*\n\n**Build Quality:** \n\nNo, it's not an all aluminium chassis.  I really wouldn't consider the computer a \"thin and light\" either, even though it's advertised as one. While it's not a chonky boy, it's not exactly thin, and not the lightest.  Measures in at 20mm and 3.9 pounds. \n\nDeck flex however, is impressive. While it's not a Macbook, it barely moves when putting a good amount of pressure on it. The entire body seems really sturdy and doesn't budge. Screen hinges are really good. (side note: I think an added benefit of the lifting monitor design that Asus has been doing recently increased the stability and longevity of the hinges.. time will tell) The screen itself has a bit more flex than I would like, but it's okay. Not the greatest, not the worst I have seen. \n\nThe exterior is a matte smooth plastic all around. Not going to turn heads by any means and has the potential to be a scratch magnet if you are throwing into and out of a backpack all day. (although miles better than the glossy plastic laptops from a few years ago)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOverall, for the price of this laptop, I'm very impressed. Quality hardware that will satisfy most casual workloads and keeps Windows 10 snappy, upgradable components, and a very impressive trackpad and keyboard make for a compelling purchase. Obvious detractors are the TN panel and soldered 4GB RAM preventing more than 8GB without sacrificing losing dual channel memory.",
  "Does this have a webcam?",

  "Asus entry level laptop are cheap for a reason, everything other than the motherboard start failing after 4 months. I bough a new asus laptop (x555lab, i5 5200u 4gb ram 500gb hdd) back in 2014 thinking that it is cheaper than the other brands so i must have got a good deal. 4 months later, the    numpad failed, so many repating keys so i had to use keytweak to disable that side of the keyboard. Another 2 months and the speakers are dead, no sign of damage, they just died one day. So far it has only been sitting on a table, i dont carry it around. I had a presentation one day so i bough it to class, guess what, battery is 30min, there is supposed to be a chip that stop the battery from charging when it reached a certain point when plugged in, that didnt work so no more battery. Foward to 2017, i has been sitting on the same table which is dry, cool, no dust and no direct sunlight, somehow an ant manage to slip through the gap at the bottom of the screen, crawl inside, died there and some months later, its corpse decayed and damaged the pixels around it. I had an assignment that require alot of typing and the some keys of the left side of the keyboard dont work anymore so i had it replaced with a replacement part from asus, worked fine then i decided to put it away in a laptop bag in the desk drawer for 2 months since i bought a new laptop, took it out and this time both the left and right side failed at the same time, some keys repeated, some doesn't even work, so i replaced it again. The battery was replaced at the same time as the first keyboard replacement, same brand, after 5 charge cycles (batterymon) it wont charge anymore and yes i did plug in and even borrowed someone else's charger too, the port wasnt loose. Replaced it again. One day it was running slow, checked the hard disk and turn out it has 8 bad sectors and speed is reduced compared to a brand new disk of the same model(crystal disk mark, 50% drop) so i bought an ssd and put the hdd in the dvd player place. Things that didn't fail was: motherboard, dvd player, web cam, the ports, trackpad, on board 4gb of ram. Im very attentive to the stuff i use, clean it often with microfiber cloth, no liquid, no drop, didnt sit on it, didnt overheat it since i mostly browse the web. Compared to the fujitsu biblo fmv laptop i bought used in 2012, the thing never break except the battery and loose charging port, every thing else worked perfectly, good screen, good keyboard, the hard drive is still good, only 2 bad sectors which is impressive since its an old ide drive and the laptop came out in 2007. Too bad the web is not core 2 duo t5600 1,83ghz (even on lubuntu) friendly so i took out the hard drive and sold the rest in 2019 since i had 3 laptops at the time. The drive still works as an external hard drive in 2020, crazy. I would stay clear of asus entry level laptop if i were you. Good luck with your laptop and may it never fail.",
  "Dell XPS 15 Review I have had my XPS 15 (2017 model) for about a year now, so I figure it's high time I share my thoughts on it fully.\n\nSpecs: I7-8750H | 16gb | 512gb SSD | GTX 1050Ti 4gb | 4K Touch Monitor\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe machine is sleek. The aluminum on the chassis makes it feel rigid, but the plastic interior makes it seem a little friendlier on the outside. It's hard to beat the infinity edge display, and with 4K touch, it's hard to not love it. The biggest problem with the display is its ability to collect fingerprints, but part of my noticing that is because I work in a naturally lit room, so they're very apparent to me. \n\nThe keyboard is phenomenal when it comes to productivity, and my typing experience while writing papers and drafting documents was great. Gaming, however, is a whole different thing. The GPU would lead you to believe that it would be great for gaming, but the truth is that for me the wrist rest on the laptop just made my arm hurt after more than about 10 minutes, and by 30 minutes it isn't worth it to game anymore. With gaming, I actually found it a better experience to just use a crappy wired keyboard instead. \n\nThe trackpad is about what should be expected. Not much more to say there.\n\nThe IO is unbeatable. 2 USB type A, and thunderbolt 3 USB C means that anything you need, you're covered for. Full sized HDMI came in handy more than once, and it meant that I hardly ever had to carry around an adapter, unless there was a very specific purpose for it. \n\nThe internals are nearly impossible to beat in a machine like this. 16 gigs of ram is more than I think I ever needed, and the 8th gen I7 can do anything you need it to and more. With the GPU, this laptop actually goes head to head with my desktop. The biggest bottleneck for me was almost always the internet of where I am, and not the internal specs. Games run just as fast as they should on a laptop like this, although usually I turned down the resolution a bit to give myself the extra details. \n\nInstead of dealing with a 17'' computer that has a 15'' screen with an inch bezel, on each side, I actually have a 15\" laptop, and it feels nice. It's not clunky except for in airplanes, and fits in a bag just fine. It's weight is comparable to a book that one might have in their bag, and with the performance it packs, it didn't bother me at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall I have loved the past year with this machine, and I'll have it until I manage to snag something else absolutely amazing by some stroke of luck. It wasn't a hassle to carry around at all, and it was functional beyond anything I ever needed. I did have one issue with the SSD, but Dell customer service was awesome and ended up sending me a new SSD, then taking it in to replace the motherboard when that didn't work, for absolutely no cost to me; not even shipping. Absolutely amazing service there. For anyone who needs a machine that can do a little bit more than your average laptop, this is certainly the way to go.",
  "Any issues with thermal throttling? Are you getting your expected performance while gaming or doing hard work on the laptop?",
  "[removed]",
  "I haven't experienced anything major, but it definitely gets hot when under a heavy load. That being said, the bigger issue pertaining to cooling was how loud the fans could get, sometimes not even under heavy load. A small jet engine took off often in my Calculus class.",
  "I love the 4k display on the XPS 15 because it's just unbelievably sharp at 15''. That being said, I have certainly experienced some battery loss, and truthfully, it's just not necessary. 2k would have been perfectly fine for me.",
  "Any Reviews for ASUS M580VD-EB76 VivoBook 15.6\" FHD, i7-7700HQ, 16GB, GTX 1050? Other than being a bit heavier and probably shorter battery life, this Asus Vivobook seems to have similar specs to the XPS 15 and Yoga 720:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/M580VD-EB76-VivoBook-Gaming-Multimedia-GeForce/dp/B071ZL3996/\n\nI'm thinking about getting an Aero 15 or XPS 15 for my next laptop as a developer and slightly more than occasional gamer who still wants the more professional aesthetic. Lighter is definitely better, but for half the price and maybe an extra half pound this might get the job done.\n\nAny reviews out there for this model? What would I be sacrificing here?",
  "There are no reviews for it yet. Based on the description and specs, it looks like a really good deal for the price. It would be competing with the Dell Inspiron 7567 and other budget GTX 1050 laptops, but with the premium styling and materials of the Zenbook line. \n\nSeveral previews and product listings show it with a TN panel, with the IPS display available for an optional charge. I would make sure wherever you buy it that you get the IPS version. \n\nIt also has a small-ish battery at 47Wh according to previews, so it's not going to have the battery life of the XPS 15 or Aero. \n\nIt also doesn't have TB3 for external graphics, but it does have USB 3.1 Type C for monitors and high speed transfers. \n\nSo overall, vs the XPS 15 and Aero:\n\n* Much smaller battery, definitely lower battery life\n\n* No TB3\n\n* No RGB keyboard like the Aero\n\n* Screen is not color accurate like the Dell XPS 15 and the Aero\n\n* Base model offers TN display instead of IPS display\n\n* Unknown if the keyboard/chassis has a lot of flex like some of the other recent ASUS models - seems likely given the price point and components - the XPS does not have this issue. \n\nOverall, for the price, it seems very compelling if you can get the IPS display option and deal with, say 5-7 hours of battery life instead of 8-13 hours, and you don't mind the lack of TB3. ",
  "$800 model: 15.6\" Full HD, anti-glare display\n$1000 model: 15.6\" Full HD color rich, anti-glare display\nI would speculate that the first one has a 45%NTSC IPS or TN panel, and the second one has a 72%NTSC IPS panel.\n\nThe second config is a better deal overall. Some companies charge $200 for the i7 upgrade alone.",
  "Thanks for the in-depth comparisons! Since this is my laptop for the next 4-5 years I'll probably go for the Aero or XPS, just seemed strange I hadn't seen this more given the hardware specs for the price.",
  "You sure the 2nd one with gtx 1050 4gb vram and i7 has IPS? because it doesn't say so",
  "You're basically paying $200 for i7, 8GB Ram, 1Tb HDD and potentially IPS.",
  "On the Asus webpage lists four types of panels, the only TN one is 45% NTSC. Plus it's really rare to find a 72% NTSC TN nowadays.",

  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience). I have a Lenovo duet 5 now which I love but the snapdragon is feeling a little long in the tooth when I have more than a few tabs open.\n\nI guess my heart says Lenovo but brain said MacBook Air.",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop. Having good speakers is a great bonus for the Lenovo for me, as well as a bright screen. Don't need maximum power as for heavy workload I want to rely on remote desktops.",
  "Check your local best buys, in my area (SE Michigan) the Lenovo is on BB as a used excellent for $530 which is the right price point. So see if you can find one in your area for that price",
  "Unfortunately not near me but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nWhat do you think the chances of the kompanio lasting close to apple silicon?",
  "Not sure, thats a ChatGPT quesiton lol \n\nHappy hunting, hopefully you can find one soon.   I hear that they are high-end Chromebooks with Spandragon x Elite processors coming; I'm hoping they are here just before the holiday season.",
  "Ended up with the m4 MacBook air. It went on sale on Amazon for 750(!) and I can't find the Lenovo near me. Also mixed in the surface laptop for fun but the air just seems too good. Thanks again for your help!",
  "HP Elitebook Ultra G1i Full Review Hey r/laptops,\n\nFirst full review here. I'm a recent convert (or attempted convert) from the world of macOS. For context, I've been daily driving a 2018 15\" Intel MacBook Pro for the past six years and reasons I won’t bore you with, I decided it was time to jump back into the Windows world.\n\nMy initial plan was to wait for reviews of a few more Intel Lunar Lake laptops before making a move. But, as fate would have it, my trusty MacBook met an untimely demise (coffee, laptops, and kids don't mix), so I was forced to upgrade immediately. \n\n**My needs**:\n\nComing from a MacBook, battery life was super important. I wasn't expecting miracles, but I needed something that could realistically get me through a transatlantic flight or a full day of cafe work on a single charge. My workload is heavily productivity-focused: emails, Google Docs, PDFs, Office suite (Word, PowerPoint), Slack, Teams, web browsing, and the usual social media (primarily Facebook/Messenger). I also do light Python coding in VS Code occasionally.\n\nMy first attempt was the Asus Zenbook S14. On paper, it looked promising, but two things killed it for me. First, the non-haptic trackpad was a bigger hurdle than I anticipated. After years with one, it felt like a significant downgrade in daily usability to go to a precision trackpad. Second, and more critically, it flat-out refused to work with my external USB-C display (Dell U3219Q). This was a dealbreaker for me, so it went back to BestBuy. \n\nAfter the Zenbook, I was now specifically looking for a 14\" laptop with a haptic trackpad, Intel Lunar Lake (mainly for optimized battery life and compatibility), and premium build quality. Price wasn’t really an object. I just wanted the right machine.\n\nDell  XPS was out due to the function row layout (no physical keys. The one thing I hated about my Macbook Pro). I briefly considered Surface Laptops, even without Lunar Lake, but the lack of USB-C charging ports on both sides felt like a bizarre step back after years of convenience. It's a small thing, but these little annoyances add up.\n\nI ended up zeroing in on the new HP EliteBook lineup. Specifically, the EliteBook Ultra G1i and the EliteBook X G1i. Initially, the X G1i was more appealing due to the built-in HDMI port (less dongle life) and the lack of an expandable USB-A port like the Ultra (less potential for mechanical failure down the line). However, the X G1i had three dealbreakers: no haptic trackpad (again!), no OLED display (the LCD isn't bezel-less), and the baffling placement of the Page Up/Page Down keys above the side arrow keys – a recipe for accidental key presses.\n\nSo, I bit the bullet and went for the HP EliteBook Ultra G1i. I opted for the configuration with 32GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, with a plan to upgrade the storage later (it uses a standard 2280 NVMe drive).\n\n**HP EliteBook Ultra G1i – The Review:**\n\n**Build Quality:**\n\nGenerally excellent. Very close to my Macbook. The chassis feels solid and premium. My only real gripe here is display wobble!! The hinge itself is tight and holds the screen at any angle, but the display panel itself is surprisingly wobbly. Even when stationary, it seems overly sensitive to vibrations and movement. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s definitely noticeable and less refined than I expected. See video below where I have it next to my work laptop which is a 14\" Macbook pro. I tap the table a bit with my leg and the wobble is pretty noticeable.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1izv3v7/video/peee1onmxrle1/player\n\nI also noticed a minor annoyance with the up arrow key. It feels mushy compared to the rest of the keyboard, which is a bit jarring in an otherwise premium experience.\n\n**Keyboard:**\n\nApart from the one mushy key, the keyboard overall is a strong point. Coming from a MacBook, the keys require a bit more actuation force, but they are satisfyingly clicky and tactile. I was able to get up to my usual touch-typing speed quickly. Key travel is good, and overall, no complaints about the typing experience itself. My only minor quibble is the font choice on the keycaps. It’s fine, but I think a slightly different font or a smaller text size on the keys would look nicer. Purely subjective, though.\n\n  \n**Haptic Trackpad:**\n\nThis was a major selling point for me, and thankfully, the haptic trackpad is good. It replicates the feel of a physical click pretty well. However, I did notice a couple of quirks. There seems to be a subtle difference in pressure sensitivity – it feels like it requires slightly more pressure to click towards the top of the trackpad compared to the bottom.\n\nMore noticeably, I found that palm rejection isn't perfect. If the palm of my other hand rests slightly on the trackpad, clicks can sometimes fail to register. Also, and this might be a Windows thing (coming from macOS), you can't two-finger scroll and click simultaneously. On macOS, I'm used to being able to two-finger scroll and then click without lifting my fingers. On the EliteBook, you have to lift your fingers from the trackpad before clicking for the click to register. It took me a while to realize this was happening and why some clicks were being missed.\n\n**Display:**\n\nThe OLED display is gorgeous. Colors are vibrant (if not a bit too vibrant at times), blacks are inky deep, and everything just pops. However, and it's a significant \"however,\" it is **incredibly reflective.** It’s like working in front of a mirror in bright environments. While the display is sharp and detailed, it's not bright enough to effectively combat the glare in well-lit spaces. In my typical dimly lit workspace, it’s fine, but in brighter conditions, the glare becomes a real problem, more so than I experienced with my MacBook Pro’s display.\n\n**Camera:**\n\nWecam is fine, although my skin tone is really off and colors are over-saturated. This isn't just an OLED display issue. When I'm on a meeting, other people look fine, while I look either jaundiced or red as a tomato. The Poly Camera Pro software that comes installed weirdly doesn't allow me to adjust the white balance. This issue aside, the resolution and quality itself is great. It's just the colors are a bit weird.  \n\n**Performance:**\n\nPerformance-wise, the EliteBook Ultra G1i is snappy and responsive for my productivity workload. As I mentioned, I'm mostly doing a bunch of productivity work, some light coding, and general web browsing. It handles everything I throw at it without breaking a sweat, and stays very quiet. Apart from initial setup, I basically never heard the fans. For my use case, performance is more than adequate.\n\n**Battery Life: The Unforgivable Sin**\n\nAnd now we come to the absolute dealbreaker: battery life. It is, in a word, abysmal. I’m consistently getting only 4-5 hours of real-world use, maybe 6!! And this is regardless of what I'm doing. Whether I'm just browsing the web in Edge, working in Google Docs, or doing anything else, the battery life hovers around the 5 hour mark. I have yet to break the 8-hour barrier, let alone reach the double-digit figures I was hoping for.\n\nI consider myself fairly tech-savvy, and I’ve gone through all the usual stuff: checking startup apps, monitoring process usage, disabling unnecessary browser extensions, tweaking power settings – all to no avail. I can only conclude that HP hasn't properly optimized battery management on this laptop yet, or the hardware is simply power-hungry.\n\nFor a modern ultraportable in this price range, and especially one marketed towards business professionals, this battery life is simply unacceptable. It completely defeats the purpose of portability and long work sessions away from a power outlet. My old 2018 MacBook Pro, even with its old battery, often lasted longer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a tough one. The HP EliteBook Ultra G1i has a lot going for it. The build quality is generally excellent, the keyboard and trackpad are good (albeit with some quirks), and the OLED display is stunning (if overly reflective). Performance is more than sufficient for productivity tasks. However, the catastrophic battery life completely overshadows all its positives. For a laptop that is supposed to be a premium, ultraportable business machine, lasting only 4-5 hours on a charge is simply not good enough. It fails in its fundamental purpose as a portable device in 2025.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I've decided to return the HP EliteBook Ultra G1i. It’s a shame, as I wanted to love this laptop. But battery life is a non-negotiable for me, especially at this price point (I dropped $2,300 USD on this). I’ll be going back to using my work laptop while I do more research and wait for more Lunar Lake (and maybe AMD Strix Point?) options to become available and reviewed.\n\nHappy to answer any questions you have about my experience with the EliteBook Ultra G1i. Hopefully, this review will help others in their laptop search!",
  "I've been daily driving a Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition 15.3\" Lunar Lake 258V 32GB 4TB SSD (upgraded) for a while. Similar productivity focused use. Easily getting 10+ hours out of it. Sometimes I don't charge it for two days or so if I don't do video calls. Excellent build quality, keyboard, and display. No haptic touchpad though, but I have never used one and am comfortable with this.",
  "Thanks for the helpful review. My choice came down to this one and the Lenovo Thinkapd X9.\n\nHave you checked out the new Lenovo Thinkpad X9 14\" ? Antiglare OLED (30-120 Hz VRR); Haptic touch, Lunar Lake, Thin and light, strong build quality but \"only\" 55 Wh battery. However, this should last at least 10hours. Check out Andrew's Review Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRuzefBwUVQ&t=324s&ab\\_channel=AndrewMarcDavid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRuzefBwUVQ&t=324s&ab_channel=AndrewMarcDavid)\n\nWhat you can also consider is maybe Snapdragon X Elite Laptops, Even more efficent than Intel / AMD and with better performance. I am currently typing on a Lenovo Slim 7x. Overall its great but I will probably switch to X9 because there some (minor) X86 apps I need (plus I prefer an antiglare screen).\n\nEDIT: I just ordered the X9",

I only ask as the HP EliteBook 8 G1i is so much lighter than the Flip alternative. My needs are to annotate pdf's, but I'd rather lose the 'artistic' functionality of the FLIP and shave 200g lugging it around. Appreciate you'd also lose the active stylus accuracy etc, but for simple note taking (I'm thinking the equivalent of a fingertip writing)... could be just the job.",

  "Hi - I recently picked up a HP Elitebook X G1a and it has Win 11 25H2 installed. While it seems to be running OK, when the device goes to Sleep for an extended period of time, it crashes and powers off. When I wake the devices it prompts you to login as if started up from shutdown.  None of the prior apps are open, etc. It seems to work OK if put into hibernation mode but Windows 11 sleep mode. It working. I’ve tried disabling Windows Fast Startup and installing all available Windows Updates. I’ve tried both the HP AMD chipset and video drivers as well as the latest available AMD Adrenaline drives directly from AMD website. Upon reviewing the Event Viewer, it appears something is causing it to consistently encounter repeated unexpected shutdowns.  I believe it has something to do with AMD ACPI issues but cannot quite tell.  Was hoping someone might be able to assist before I return/RMA this unit.  Thanks.",
  "It looks like a beautiful laptop. I considered it, and it's 14\" sibling and the 9i too (though that one has a weird extra column of keys and an under display webcam), but I can't live without the haptic trackpad. Glad you're enjoying it and getting great battery life!",
  "Thanks for the feedback. I did see the Thinkpad X9. Actually I would have bought it, but for some reason I don't like the engine hub design. I prefer an even thickness laptop. This looks really weird to me. But it looks like it might work for you. Let me know how you like it! \n\nI did consider snapdragon but like you I have a couple pieces of software that don't play well with them (I tried) so I decided I wanted to go lunar lake.",
  "It's a 64 WHr battery. Middle of the pack for what I've seen on Lunar Lake laptops.",
  "Your old Zbook Fury wouldn't have a 120hz OLED 2.8K touchscreen panel.  That is why the battery drain is so severe on the Elitebook Ultra.  Simply dropping the refresh rate to 60hz will net you a 30% battery life gain.  Take away touch screen and you get another 20-30% in battery life gain.  That alone will get you from a 5-6hr device to almost 10 hours alone.  But for any device right now with a 2.8K 120hz OLED touchscreen panel, the battery life is going to be abysmal unless you put a 90WHr battery in it.  Then the device will be much heavier and not as sleek.",

(IPS, anti reflective).\n\nWhat do you think?",
  "That probably plays a role. My ZBook 17 G8 can do 5 - 6 hours running web tasks even with its full fat hardware purely due to its battery being big enough to compensate.\n\nBe interesting to see a lunar lake machine with a battery of equivalent size.",
  "I mean it does have the 4K dreamcolor panel, which on the G8 and newer is a 120hz unit - albeit an IPS panel, not OLED. It's also not a touch screen so that probably plays a part.",
  "Thanks, any idea how to reinstall windows on the new disk?",
  "Thanks for the feedback. I actually ended up getting the Microsoft Surface Laptop for Business. I love it. Build quality is even better than the HP Elitebook Ultra. I have two complaints that I've just learned to overlook. The first is a lack of USB-C ports on both sides of the laptop. An annoying issue I haven't had to think about in many years. The second is that when the laptop is plugged in, and under load, there's a tiny bit of coil whine coming from the charger port. Seems like an issue with the surface laptop as I found other posts where people are complaining about this on the snapdragon model. But as I said, I'll learn to live with both.

  "I'm happy with the Surface Laptop. I'm going to be keeping it. The screen is not as reflective as my old Macbook as is on par or slightly less reflective than my work MBP, but certainly not as matte as the newest generation of MacBooks. My only real complaint at the moment is the lack of a USB-C port on both sides of the laptop. \n\nI'm not a fan of the corporate style of the X1, and don't like the 2 in 1 form factor either. The X9 might work for you, but 400 nits is kinda low. The Surface Laptop is 600 nits, moderately anti-reflective, but it's not an OLED display. \n\nGood luck with your search!",
  "4 months later. Are you still happy with your purchase?\n\nI am currently trying to choose between the Surface Laptop 7, X1 Carbon, EliteBook Ultra g1i and EliteBook X g1a.\n\nAnd I was wondering, why didn't you originally consider the EliteBook X g1a with the much more powerful ryzen 9 hx 375 chip?  \nAlso, what windows resolutions scaling do you use?  \nDid you find a natural scaling spot where the text was larger or smaller than with the 2880x1800 panels vs the 2304x1536 found in the surface?  \nHas the coil while gotten better or worse, or do you simply not think about it anymore? Also does it only come from the surface connect charger or also when using usb-c charging?  \nHow is the battery life for demanding tasks?",
  "Yes, I'm happy with the surface laptop! It's not perfect, but I don't have any major regrets. \n\nI didn't consider the elitebook X g1a because it didn't have a haptic track pad and it has the split right/left arrow keys with the page up/down buttons which I despise. It's an abomination. \n\nI'm using 150% scaling at full resolution and that's perfect for me. No complaints there. \n\nThe coil whine is still present when plugged in, but I don't really notice it anymore most of the time as I'm usually very focused when I'm working or have headphones on. I'm also on battery most of the time. I think I noticed it for the first time in months just the other day. So not bad. \n\nI haven't actually ever used the surface connect charger. It's still wrapped up in the box. I carry a single USBC charger and cable with me for all my devices and don't feel like carrying another. It certainly would have been nice to have a USBc port on the right side of the laptop for this reason, and it's caused me an issue twice now, but I've learned to live with it. \n\nThe battery life is... Okay. I really don't know how reviewers are getting the insane battery life they're reporting. For my Macbook which I had used in an identical manner I was getting 50% or so more battery life out of it. That's really the only thing that's making me miss Apple. For my overall work style, their battery life is just superior!",
  "Thanks for the answers! One final question for you. Do you notice any screen door effect due to the touchscreen even though it's IPS and not OLED?",
  "You're welcome! Nope I don't see any screendoor effect. The display is great! I wish it were brighter, but that's it. Good luck with your decision!",
  "I had exactly the same. i had the elitebook ultra g1i and i loved it expect two things made me return it. 1. was the screen door effect which was notable to me althought high resolution. it was not real bad like on cheap zenbook but still there and it botherd me when browsing, read news, on hight brightness. 2. the screen wooble was bad too, sit on sofa, touch the screen wooble, type wooble. the rest i really loved, portable, fast, oled. now i also have the surface laptop 7 and i love it. i wish is was ratio 16:10 instead 3:2 but i can live with it.\n\nthe screen door effect comes onyl with oled displays, and it depends on ppi, the higher and the higher the resolution the better it should be. The worst ive seen so far are on Asus Zenbooks. IPS display never have a metal mesh. Surface Laptop has PixelSense which also not has a mesh.",
  "Asus ExpertBook P5 (P5405) Review I just got the Asus ExpertBook P5 with 32gb RAM and here are my impressions from a few days of using it. My review isn't based on any benchmarks but instead based on my regular daily use.    \n  \nI like the clean/simplistic design and I'm impressed by the Lunar Lake performance (it's life changing for me coming from a 3-year old Intel laptop that lasts 2-3 hours on battery). I picked the Expertbook P5 over the Zenbook S14 because of the lower price point and ventilation design, which allows me to use it with the lid closed while docked without losing performance (I am assuming that the S14 would lose some performance since the ventilation grills above the keyboard would be blocked with the lid closed but please correct me if I'm wrong). \n\n* **Battery Life:** In my experience the battery life lasted 8-9 hours in a regular office work environment, which I define as having Chrome open with several tabs, listening to music, and working on some basic desktop apps like Office365/Google Drive suite. However, it seems the Zenbook S14 battery lasts almost twice as much from the benchmark tests I've seen online, which doesn't make sense to me since it only has a 15% larger battery (72 Wh vs 63 Wh). If this is a Chrome battery drain bug, hopefully a future BIOS update can fix it. On a similar note, when I first booted the laptop the battery wasn't charging but the issue was fixed after I downloaded a BIOS update that was already available.\n* **Build Quality:** This is a big negative for me. The touch pad feels like a loose piece of plastic and it makes a click noise even with the slightest touch which is bothersome. The keyboard feels cheap and some keys make a crackling noise if you try to move them slightly with your finger tips. I also have an issue where the laptop fan makes a click noise every time it starts, which is not a big deal but can get annoying when you hear it every time. Additionally the lid creaks a bit when opening and closing the laptop. When I first got the laptop it didn't lay perfectly flat on the table, so I had to twist it a bit and now it's even.\n* **Software:** The laptop also comes with a bunch of bloatware (McAfee and Asus software) but at least it can be uninstalled. I tried the Asus Business AI tools that are supposed to be unique about this laptop but they are not that useful IMO (but in fairness it's in beta). The video transcript / summary tool is slow and seems to be processing stuff on the cloud (not locally), and other features like having a business card overlay on your webcam is silly.\n* **Price:** I think the price point ($1100 to $1300) compared to other Lunar Lake laptops in the market right now is pretty good, specially since the P5 comes with a 3-year warranty for no additional cost. \n\nOverall I give the Expertbook P5 a score of 6 out of 10. It's almost a good laptop but I can't get over the build quality and the business tools don't seem useful to me. I think for now I will wait for more Lunar Lake ultrabooks to come out and throw in a few more bucks to get better quality. Lunar Lake is an amazing upgrade but right now I feel like some manufacturers are trying to rush these into the market. I am in need of one of these laptops badly so I'm just waiting for the right one to come out, but it's definitely not the Expertbook P5.",
  "That's interesting, hence there is only 1 review on Youtube about this new guy from Asus, and it was quite positive... What about the sound? and its display? It's supposed to be awesome, isn't it? At least for me, it's only one laptop with IPS 2k without PWM and +- normal battery life.... However, the question is - can be the build quality and shitty webcam a deal breaker... Now I can't see direct competitors in that price range and IPS + Luna Lake...\n\n  \nAny ideas?",
  "I wouldn't stress too much about the battery part, I've never even remotely achieved the battery life tested in reviews with any laptop.\n\nThey just click run on a battery benchmark or let it play back a video, this isn't applicable to actual usage.\n\nIf you got 8-9 hours of genuine office work, Chrome, YT running in the background, cloud sync etc., that's a very good result in my experience.\n\nI've also pre-ordered the ExpertBook P5, but no shipping info so far. The build quality sounds like a downer, but could be unit to unit variance. If mine is as bad as yours, I'll just return it.",
  "I purchased this laptop too. Chose it over last gen processors that were heavily discounted. The screen is very good in my opinion. Sound is also pretty good for casually watching movies and video conferencing. Might need a little tweaking like turning off unnecessary spatial sound and such. On my unit, there are no issues with creaking of the lid and the touch pad. Keyboard feels pretty standard to me, maybe a bit heavier actuation for my taste. I am not sure if it is the fan but the laptop makes constant crunching noises like there is and silent HDD inside and not SSD. Have not tested the battery life that thoroughly yet so I cannot speak to that. Maybe it can be the higher refresh rate? By default it was set to 60Hz but I did put it to 144Hz.\n\n  \nOverall a good package for me. Only real issue for me is the webcam quality. I would have paid more for a better one.",

  "You should really try to test the performance on battery. I have the same model and I noticed that the performance drastically decreases on battery, so is the package power draw. From 35-37w while plugged in down to 25w for a short time(about 10 seconds) then down to 15w. This decreases Cinebench R23 scores down to 7800 multicore, but the one that suffers most is the GPU, as it struggles to keep the clocks high enough for for it to be considered usable. Any idea as to why did they artificially limit performance while competitors such as the Lenovo 7i Aura with the same CPU can keep the plugged in performance while on battery?",
  "I've had mine a few weeks and don't have any of the quality or noise issues OP described. Maybe I got lucky or they were unlucky. It's definitely not a premium laptop like a Macbook or Surface, but it's close and appropriately less expensive. It has some practical benefits that some more expensive options lack like a matte screen and extra M2 slot. Light, fast, quiet, and relatively cheap.\n\nAlways annoyed I have to peel off stickers and uninstall bloatware, but that seems to be unavoidable on Windows laptops unless you get a Surface.",

  "I want to confirm the sound made by the fans when they start.\n\nIt also feels like a \"haptic vibration\" when you have the hands on the laptop.\n\nThe fact that several people have encountered this makes me think that it is a kind of manufacturing defect and not a particular defect on my laptop.\n\nApart from this, the laptop meets expectations:\n\n* solid\n* good screen\n* decent keyboard and touchpad",
  "I recently got this laptop. Agree with most of your points. My biggest problem is the trackpad. it definitely feels loose and cheap and not for extended use. My unit makes an odd electric noise i can hear from the bottom.   \nBattery lasts between 7-10hs with casual use on 80% brightness (7h if i go 144hz and closer to 10h if i do 60hz+ windows battery settings). I actually quite liked the keyboard. Never tried thinkpads but I liked mine better than macbooks (deeper travel, better feel). screen is good, not on par with oleds but at least its matte and not glossy. ports (2 type-c TB4 and 2 type-A + HDMI) and extra ssd + replacable network card are great. My fans don't make that sound you mentioned, but they do turn on and off in daily use a lot, but i don't hear them. Overall i'd give it an 8/10. Only if the trackpad was better and battery was closer to what was advertised.",
  "Surface or Aura",
  "Yeah I've seen that Youtube review and I'm wondering why there aren't any others. The Expertbook P5 seems to be out of the radar for a lot of people.\n\nThe sound and the display are good. The only area where the display could be better is extra brightness. The P5 only goes up to 400 nits brightness, whereas some of the more premium Lunar Lakes go up to 500 nits. If you are working in an outdoor environment the extra 100 nits could be useful. Indoors I was using the second highest brightness setting (that's what went into my 8-9 hour battery life test).\n\nAgree on price point... the other one I'm considering is the Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition (15″ Intel) Laptop but it's $200 more and it's a 15\" laptop (vs 14\" P5).",

  "FWIW it's worth, the best two battery life benchmarks out there are UL's PCMark 10 Modern Office, and its Procyon Microsoft Office battery benchmark. They'll never be perfect as everyone's usage is difference. But, they do offer a consistent, best case scenario comparison across models.",
  "Hey, thank you for your comment. I was considering ordering this laptop, but I really hate these electronic noises that you described.",
  "any update on that noise?",
  "How is your battery life?",
  "Hey I saw your post and was curious about how good the matte screen was? Is there any reflection as that is a deal-breaker for me and hoping that this is not reflective. Thanks in advance for any info.",
  "Anybody who is facing the fan issue have found a solution?",
  "So I've managed to find a solution I think. The good news is that it's not the fan itself making the noise, but another component rattling in there, every time the fan kicks in.\n\nAs you open up the laptop – It's the leftmost metal tab holding the battery into place. When the fan kicks in this metal tab tends to vibrate and hit the opposite bottom plate, where it rattles against an extruded piece of plastic, which amplifies the sound.\n\nTo fix it, you just need to put a piece of electrical tape over it so that it stops vibrating. This solved it 90% for me. I can still hear the fan very faintly if i pay attention, but not as distracting as before.\n\nHere is a visual guide: https://imgur.com/a/L90amx5\n\nLet me know if this works for you.",
  "someone above mentioned there's a piece of metal holding the battery which is the rattling electric sound.\n\nAs for 3 months later, how is it? Are you still a happy customer with it?\n\nHinges still a'ight?",
  "Yes, Yoga is a cool option, however, that glossy display is a deal breaker for me... I can't stand the displays which harm my eyes more than it's necessary...  All my hopes are on an update or other magic from Asus that should fix the issue with the battery, cause there is not a normal explanation for 7-8 hours for the IPS and luna lake",
  "Did you received it? I'm interested in your opinion! thanks you",
  "Nope, my order was through the official Asus store and they've refreshed the expected shipping date to 12. of October.\n\nThey still haven't shipped anything.",
  "Seems nice and matte to me, but I'm sure there's still some reflection. I too am really annoyed by glossy screens and I use this thing all over the house without being aware of reflections.\n\n6 months in now and I'm still really happy with this laptop. It's been a good performer and stable. For the body I'm still happy with the tradeoff of it being high end plastic (top lid is metal) but cheaper and lighter. Only annoyance has been accidentally sliding the physical camera shutter when opening it.",
  "Mine is doing the same clicking sound. I want to try what you suggest however I struggle to open it. Is there a screw in the middle under the rubber bumper ? If yes how did you remove that rubber thing.  Or is it under the stickers ? Thank you very much",
  "This is a review I found that also references the battery problem: [https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/asus-expertbook-lunar-lake-review/](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/asus-expertbook-lunar-lake-review/)\n\nHonestly I would have keep the P5 with a score of 7 or 8 out of 10. Maybe I just got a faulty unit but I felt that I had to return it, otherwise these quality issues would continue to grow over the next 1-2 years. It felt like a laptop that I would only own for a year before wanting to get a new one.",

  "Awesome. Thank you for this info. I have an Asus ux430u laptop that I bought 8 years ago and it has held up extremely well but it's time for the upgrade. This one seems very similar in style to that with future proof specs. 32gb should hold for several years. \nThe price I'm seeing online is $1,200 which I guess is fair with the specs but just checking if you found any good deals or discounts anywhere. Thanks again for the info.",
  "ok I managed to open it. There is no screw in the middle only on the edges. It seems it indeed solves the clicking noise. The metal battery holders are loose and when fan starts, the air flow moves them and that's the cause of clicking noise. Thank you very much for sharing information",
  "true haha",
  "I've received it by now and the only issue I can confirm is the fan making a click noise when spinning up.\n\nOnce the fan is continuously running, it's quiet compared to most other laptops and doesn't have annoying high pitched noises, but the startup sound is noticeable and quite odd.\n\nThe keyboard is on the louder side, but feels nice to use and is on the same tier as HP ExpertBooks and Thinkpads, no crackling here.\n\nThe lid and keyboard deck feel very solid, I don't have any creaking and I'd say they are comparable with much more expensives laptops.\n\nThe bottom of the device feels a bit flimsy, though. You probably won't touch it a lot, so it's not a huge issue, but it doesn't match the quality of the rest of the device.\n\nI'm getting 10-11 hours of real world light usage (browser, mail, some small code compiles in between), which I've never seen on a non-Mac laptop before.\n\nOverall I'd recommend it, if you aren't too bothered by the fan making a click when it kicks on. I've heard this on industrial fans before, but never on a laptop.",
  "I got it off the Asus site and I think it was on sale for $100 off or something, but that's off the so-called \"regular\" price they make up as well so who knows. I know it was significantly cheaper than the similar spec Zenbook which has the more premium body and screen. But the ExpertBook one being intended for business despite being cheaper has the advantages of a matte screen and extra M2 slot. I also prefer the simple plain style on the lid.",
  "Ok the sound is still there. It seems the root cause is that the fan is loose too. [https://imgur.com/a/WGQrnfx](https://imgur.com/a/WGQrnfx)",
  "Sorry to bug you, but I'm wondering about how loud the fan clicking noise is and how long it lasts. Any chance you have a video or audio clip of it?

  "It's a single click every time the fan goes from off to on, probably from the electric motor.\n\nIt's not too loud, probably about as loud as a mouse click (different sound profile, though), but it is noticeable.

  "It's not loud, but it definitely gets annoying once you realize it's there. It was strange to me that the fan kept turning on. I ended up settling for the Lenovo Yoga Aura Edition and it doesn't make any clicking noises...",
  "It's very large, glass and uses Windows Precision drivers.   \nIf you've had other laptops with this setup, you know what to expect, there isn't really anything special about it.\n\nIt's not a fancy haptic touchpad, it still has traditional clicks.

  "Buying help I recently acquired an (undisclosed) amount of money and the first thing I'm looking to purchase is a new laptop.

I've come to accept that while I enjoy gaming on it, it's running out of storage eerily fast with less than 10GB of storage left, and it has integrated graphics. Hell, I'm surprised it even opened Fortnite 3 years ago. \n\nI was looking to purchase an ROG laptop, but I was contemplating because there's 3 lineups with different specs that look really confusing. A while ago, I wanted to look into the Razer Blade lineup, but I chose not to after seeing Salem Techsperts' review.

  "Comparing 2020 Macbook Air M1 with Asus TUF F15 AMD Ryzen 7 6800h RTX 3050 Ti I did a search comparing these two laptops because I'm more of a casual user and light gamer. I read some posts comparing these two and rather than making a comment there, I figured for posterity (since these are both pretty old) I would say something about them.\n\nI'm on a budget, not much money to work with but still wanted quality. The 2020 Macbook Air with M1 processor was $650 used on Ebay purchased last year, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD. Has been a rock solid laptop, very lightweight, super efficient and runs the host of great Apple softwares (Final Cut Pro, RAW Power, etc). The Asus TUF F15 gaming laptop was $455 shipped (eBay), purchased last week, 2022 model, Ryzen 7 6800h RTX GeForce 3050 TI, 2TB SSD. If I was a college student right now I would be thrilled with either one of these laptops.\n\nThis is my first Windows machine since 2012. I didn't realize how much I don't miss Windows, what a shitshow, incredible amount of bloat. Macs have zero bloat, no annoying questions, nothing to setup, nothing to delete, just go. The Mac has insane battery life. In 30 mins of typical use it might go from 90% to 88%. The power brick went bad on my Asus TUF few days ago. In 30 minutes I watched the battery go from 90% to 60%, WTF?? I hadn't realized the power brick went bad and it kept switching between 144hz refresh rate and 60hz, switching between performance mode and efficiency mode (I was playing a game).\n\nI should explain my gaming needs which are extremely modest. I play Weird Gun Game on Roblox which isn't graphic intensive. The RTX 3050 Ti is more than sufficient to play that game as well as Counterstrike Source. These are the only 2 games I play and I'm not really worried about \"future proofing\" my rig since I don't even play with max settings on the games I'm playing now. I don't need to see every shadow and every reflection.\n\nI started playing Weird Gun Game a month ago while on vacation and really enjoyed it on my Macbook Air. I kept noticing I was dying before it would even show on my screen which bothered me and realized my Mac has 60hz refresh rate and limited graphic processing power. I will say though, the M1 processor is able to do an adequate job and I would probably be happy if I could simply get the 144hz refresh rate.\n\nI also have a 24\" iMac desktop computer with an M3 processor which does allow better and smoother gameplay. However, like the Macbook, it only has 60hz refresh rate so it's limited. As far as the difference between the M1 and M3 processor, it's not a huge difference, it's subtle, I only notice it here and there, but I can tell it's definitely just a tad bit snappier.\n\nThe biggest surprise I'm experiencing with the jump to the Asus TUF laptop is the lower pings. My latency has dropped significantly with the Asus. Apparently the wifi card (Mediatek) on the Asus is really good. I compare both laptops (Asus and Macbook Air) in the exact same spot in my kitchen table which is approximately 15 feet from the wifi router with no obstructions. The difference in latency: with the Macbook Air playing Weird Gun Game I would get around 90ms. The Asus TUF latency would be around 60ms. It's hard to pin point because the latency is always fluctuating but that's the general number.\n\nObviously, your latency will change during the day due to local network traffics. The best latency I have ever gotten with my Macbook Air is around 70ms-80ms. The best latency I have been able to get with the Asus TUF is around 50ms-60ms. Last nite I was playing and it was hovering around 50ms which for me is just outstanding. I have Cox internet for what it's worth and Apple Airport A1521 Extreme Base Station for my wifi router.\n\nSoon as I got my Asus laptop I started playing Weird Gun Game and suddenly I felt like God. I killed the first 23 people I came across which never happens (I'm not that great). There was an immediate boost in my gameplay and the laptop has exceeded my expectations. Sure, the gameplay is indeed smoother, but I would say the biggest improvement has been to my latency which is something nobody ever talks about when they talk about gaming laptops.\n\nI had done my homework and I knew alot of people were upgrading their wifi cards. I know there's a popular upgrade involving the Intel AX210 chipset. I know my laptop is able to take this upgrade easily since the current Mediatek card is not soldered. The only reason I can find to upgrade though, is that the Intel AX210 chipset uses the 6Ghz band. Kind of pointless since my wireless router doesn't do 6Ghz but at least I know. From what I can tell, I wouldn't really experience much of an upgrade, but there really isn't much discussion on this. Has anyone upgraded from the Mediatek wifi card to the AX210? Did you see a boost in performance or lower latency? I'm really curious.\n\nI'm very grateful to one conversation regarding my router settings. I was able to switch to the 5Ghz band for my wifi router and not only has it improved my gaming experience, it has really improved my overall internet experience. Not only is latency lower, but even simple things have improved. Youtube videos load quicker, websites load quicker, everything feels snappier on the 5Ghz band. I had no idea there would be such an improvement over the 2.4Ghz band (I know, sorry I don't know much about these things). Supposedly the 2.4Ghz band is better for range, but I live in a small condo and don't need to cover a large area.\n\nOne unexpected benefit from my Asus laptop over my Macbook Air is the larger screen. The Macbook Air has only a 13\" screen whereas the screen on the Asus is 15\". I have noticed I enjoy watching Youtube videos much more over the Macbook Air. The Asus TUF F15 feels much more cinematic despite the lower overall quality. When I say quality, I'm talking about specs. The max brightness of my Macbook Air is around 400 nits which is really bright. The Asus max is less than 300 nits which isn't very good, but hasn't been an issue and I haven't really noticed. I also know the color rendition on my Macbook Air is extremely accurate as they are color calibrated from the factory. The color rendition on my Asus TUF laptop is only passable. I can't really tell that it only covers 60% of the color gamut, but then again, I haven't really used it for any hardcore video or photo editing since I do that on my Mac.\n\nAlso, because it's been so long since I have owned a Windows machine, I no longer own any software for Windows. I couldn't edit anything on my Asus laptop now if I tried. I used to own the entire Adobe Photoshop Suite with Premier and all that, but back in 2012, it was a standalone product (not a subscription).\n\nI struggled with the many suggestions about getting an Asus TUF laptop with the RTX 4050 processor. The prices were about $150-$200 more. I also looked at the RTX 3060 which is quite a performance boost over the 3050 Ti but again, it was about $150-$200 more which I just couldn't stomach. I'm really on a pretty strict budget and I'm thrilled with what I've got right now. I feel like I can handle anything, the Macbook Air has outstanding all day battery life and the Asus TUF can pretty much handle any games out there. Maybe it can't handle those games on max settings, but it will run.\n\nRegarding the Nvidia processor, I noticed the Asus TUF laptops for this year (2022) seemed to come with the RTX 3050 Ti compared to the Lenovo LOQ 15IRH8 which only came with the standard RTX 3050 and was around the same price. The \"Ti\" designation apparently offers a performance boost somewhere in the range of 10% - 15% over the standard RTX 3050 card. In real world terms, there probably isn't much of a difference, but considering the price I'm paying I'll take any boost in performance I can get.\n\nI compared lots of reviews between the Lenovo LOQ and the Asus TUF books. The build quality is supposedly better on the Asus models but from what I could see on Youtube reviews, all these laptops are plastic constructions and have considerable flexing in the keyboard and screen, especially compared to my Macbook Air which is a unibody design milled from a single block of aluminum. Comparing the two laptops in build construction isn't a comparison, the Asus TUF feels like a cheap plastic laptop, whereas the Macbook Air feels like it's solid state. There's almost zero flex on the Macbook Air (keyboard or the screen).\n\nNoise - Soon as I load up Weird Gun Game the fans on the Asus start spinning hard and do not stop. The upper right corner of the laptop (on the keyboard portion) gets hot and I can feel the hot air being pushed out from the fans. I'm thinking to place some sort of mesh over the air intakes on the bottom to prevent dusts from building up inside cause that's not something I want to deal with in the future.\n\nI tried to download Armoury Crate which is a software that allows you to tweak the color of the keyboard as well as make other changes. The software isn't downloading properly and I haven't been able to change anything but it's not that big a deal to me. I don't even use the keyboard on the Asus.\n\nSpeaking of keyboards, I was lucky enough to score a used wireless Mac keyboard. This keyboard is far superior to the one on the Asus laptop. I even prefer it over the keyboard on the Macbook Air which feel soft and squishy in comparison. If I had to compare the keyboard on the Asus TUF with the Macbook Air, I would give the nod to the Air. The keyboard travel on the Asus is a little longer which makes makes the Air feel a bit more responsive and snappier. The keyboard on the Asus is just bigger in general and I'm not used to the full size keyboard. None of my Apple stuff (24\" iMac, 27\" iMac, 13\" Macbook Air) offers a full size keyboard. I haven't used a full size keyboard since 2012 so it feels foreign to me. It's a good thing I don't use it to game, although I will say the sepia toned colors which are backlighting the keys does look nice and it's exactly the color I would have picked if I had to get stuck with 1 color.\n\nThe power brick on my Asus laptop went out few days ago and it cost me $35 to replace. The lettering was faded on it and I guess it was really used and really old. Now I'm looking at the battery level which is currently at 80% and the plug is getting disconnected every once in a while, uh oh, looks like I have an issue with the power connector. Maybe I can live with it?",
  "I'm looking at lots of posts and I'm shocked at the budgets y'all have. Damn, $2k??? I wish I had that kind of change. My friend bought an Macbook Air last year with M4 chip she spent around $1,500. She's a casual user and not even in College anymore. I told her to get the M1 Macbook Air but she said she wanted something future proof. I think the M4 Macbook Air is overkill for a casual. Fetching emails, watching Youtube videos and surfing the web has never been processor intensive, this won't be changing  in 5 years. My M1 processor will work just as well for these things in 5 years as they are now. Not to mention, in 3 years I'll be able to purchase that Macbook Air with M4 processor for $650 on eBay and I'll be all caught up.\n\nI think anyone spending $2k on a laptop today for college is just crazy. It's total overkill. At this point, you're simply spending for the sake of future proofing because there's no way you actually need all that power now. You could spend a fraction of that on a Asus TUF with RTX 4050 (can get around $650 used) and that laptop really is future proof.",
  "Tbh for your use case I think something in between would make more sense like a lunar lake chip.\n\nThere is a refurbished Acer laptop with the 226v on sale for 400 on eBay. 2 years warranty as well\n\nYou get similar efficiency to the m1 while also usable gaming performance\n\nhttps://ebay.us/m/9d6cHk\n\nBut yeah if you are more serious about gaming then a dgpu is important",

  "Buying a laptop and really at a loss **Background:** I previously had a Lenovo Ideapad 5 which was great until the display failed on me within 8 months. After a botched Lenovo repair and much complaining I finally got it back and then it developed another range of faults in the second year and Lenovo said it was too expensive to repair and handed me back my money. I was pretty surprised that Lenovo said the issues weren't 'economical to repair' and that put me back on the laptop market.\n\nAfter much research, I decided to give Lenovo another try. I heard the Thinkpad range was superior to the cheaper Ideapad so I waited for the latest Gen, bought a great spec T16 (32GB RAM, the best processor option for AMD, 500 nit screen) etc. The computer was expensive and honestly more than I really imagined spending but I was told it's a quality product and I had to increase my budget. I've been using the computer a few weeks and can appreciate the keyboard, display and general build quality. But the computer isn't perfect and i've noticed a few issues which make me hesitant to go down the repair route with Lenovo for a second time so early into ownership. There's a lot I like about this computer but I think the sensible choice is to return it and not touch Lenovo again given previous experience.\n\nSo i'm back in the market and really at a loss what to buy. The criteria is: windows based, 15.6 or 16 inch display, I have a 4k monitor I occasionally hook it up to and would like it to display 3840 x 2160. I'm not a gamer and my coding is not currently at a level where I need a supercomputer. A num pad would be nice. **Display:** I would like to avoid glossy displays and ideally have a 100% sRGB flicker free display. I'm also not convinced about OLED based on reliability and flicker. I just want something which isn't going to break on me within a year. Ideally <£1500.\n\n**HP Elitebook 860 G11**\n\nThis is probably the frontrunner. I use an Elitebook x360 for work. I know the build quality and keyboard is good. However, the computer can run pretty hot and become noisy. Battery life is a bit mediocre and the glossy screen sucks.\n\nI could get the Elitebook 860 G11 with a non-glossy 100%sRGB display and make sure I don't buy a Sure View panel as i've read bad things about it. The spec seems alright for my general needs. However, **are Elitebooks garbage?** HP hasn't always got the best rep and people complain. Saying that, here's me returning a 'solid' Thinkpad as i'm not convinced Lenovo is such great quality.\n\n**Dell**\n\nI hear Dell products have gone a bit downhill. The Latitude 7650 ticks some boxes but now seems pretty expensive. I could look at the cheaper Inspiron (or whatever they call their range). The XPS is pricey and i've seen some negative ownership reviews + I remember they really do run hot.\n\n**Acer / Asus / Samsung (something else)**\n\nI'm willing to consider one of these - maybe the Vivobook 16? I used to have Samsung computers which I quite enjoyed. Build quality was a bit questionable and it seems the Book range has become pricey. \n\nAppreciate any suggestions for laptops and specifically on HP! ",
  "HP consumer class is dogshit, business class is amazing.\n\nDell is shit, in both.\n\nAcer isn't great, ASUS is okay, Samsung is alright, Dynabook is okay, Fujitsu is great like really good, Gigabyte I never used so no idea.",

  "So you reckon I should be alright with the Elitebook? Is it worth paying extra to get 3 years warranty? 1 year did seem a bit stingy compared to Lenovo which chucked in 3 years. Maybe it's a waste of money but could be something useful to have? \n\nI have heard good things about Fujitsu although don't seem to be widely available online. Which makes me hesitant in case I ever need to use the warranty.",
  "Thanks for the suggestions which I will have a look into. zbook Fury (zbook range) probably a bit over my budget. Firefly is a possibility - I remember looking at it initially although thought maybe sacrifices are made to have it lighter / thinner vs something else for same price. \n\nSome of the Dell suggestions are discontinued, maybe you are suggesting used. XPS is pricey but i'll have a look around.",
  "Personally, I always void the warranty as soon as I receive the device. I have absolutely no idea if 3 years warranty is worth it to you or not.",
  "for the best allrounders, used options are the best ull get for <$1500",
  "I didn't think so until lately. If I'm spending a bunch of money on a device then maybe it makes some sense. Some people are happy with buying tech where they think of it as 'disposable' and expect to replace it within a few years. Whereas I hope to get 5+ years out of it. Still using a 12 year old Samsung!",
  "I'm sure that's the case. Just worried about buying a lemon and not having a warranty to fall back on.",
  "Yoga Slim 7i Aura (matte screen protector) https://preview.redd.it/b8mtcn5982gf1.jpg?width=6048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e845f5cb83ca25e4302adc0239dc73bc321964ca\n\nI’m honestly so happy with how the screen turned out after putting on a matte screen protector. Finding a laptop that checked all my boxes was tough—IPS screen, good color accuracy, a solid keyboard, portable, and still powerful enough. I’m coming from a MacBook Pro 16-inch (amazing machine, not gonna lie), but I needed to run an app that’s Windows-only.\n\nAfter watching what felt like a million laptop reviews, my final contenders were the Yoga Slim 7i Aura and the ThinkPad X9 15. I ended up going with the Yoga Slim because of the IPS screen, and once I slapped on that matte protector, it became the perfect setup for me. Now I can work in direct sunlight without worrying about glare or reflections.\n\nThe installation, though? Absolute nightmare. I had to do it twice because the first time was full of bubbles. I even tried the classic “steamed bathroom” trick, lol.

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Which laptop is best for coding purposes and multitasking? I don't want a gaming laptop , need it for coding purpose mainly.

So, would like to have some reviews about it\n",
  "NEVER buy asus laptops they are masters in pc motherboards but recently asus is horrible in laptops and their drivers and everything. for you or generally speaking Lenovo should always be your first option because it is with no doubt the best preformance per value in the market or you could also get a HP which are great but i favor Lenovo. and the ideapad slim 5 is THE BEST option, it has the best build quality and also does not break the bank.",
  "Hard time choosing a new laptop. So I currently am using a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, and am planning on upgrading because: A) It is not powerful enough, and B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nI am a student and will primarily be using the laptop for school work, so it needs to be portable and a comfortable weight to bring with me to and from class. I love how portable my 13\" Air is. I've done a LOT of research over the past two years, but never bit the bullet, but I feel like now is the time, and so I've committed to buying one now.\n\nMy use cases (in order of importance): School, Music Production, Photoshop, Gaming\n\nI don't play a lot of games but it would be nice to have a machine to play some Civ 6 or even some other, more intensive games like BO2/BO3 Zombies (and MAYBEEEE some RDR2) when I am on a plane for a long time. I want something that's decent on battery life, I don't spend all day at school, maybe 4 hours at most on a given day, so I want something that'll last me that long doing just school work without having to even worry about bringing a charger.\n\nNow, I've looked at like tens of laptops, from gaming to notebook, and I've seen some I've considered like the Zenbook S16, Lenovo Slim 7i Aura, Zenbook 14, Zenbook A14, but I've narrowed it down to a couple:\n\nZephyrus G14/G16 - The clear winner for me, problem is it is just too expensive, and the only models that go on sale into my price range are the 4050 G14 and 4060 G16 models which I've heard may not be worth it. They don't go on sale super often, and the ones that do are open box. (Currently can get the 4050 model for $1499 CAD open box)\n\nZenbook Duo 2024 (Ultra 9, 32GB, 1TB, 60hz 1080p model) - I've toyed with the idea of having this laptop for a while. My PC setup at home has 3 monitors and I absolutely love it, and could see myself getting genuine use out of both screens when writing an assignment, key word being WHEN I am doing an assignment, which isn't an every day thing. I don't think it would be powerful enough to handle any gaming at all. Surprisingly, this is actually cheaper than both the G14 and G16 Models I would be getting. (Currently can get it Refurb-Excellent for $1519 CAD)\n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 15\" - This just came out, and I feel like 15\" is the perfect size for me to be honest. I can get the spec with the Ryzen 7 260, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD (will add another in the future), and a 5060 8GB card for within my price range, around $1750 all in. It's around 4 pounds which is the heaviest of the three, but is also the fastest of the three. It's so new that there isn't a single review yet for it. (Brand new for $1750 CAD, could try and haggle it at Lenovo)\n\nThese are my three ideas right now in terms of what to get. Does anyone have any recommendations? Anyone with these laptops have advice?\n\nI'd not like to spend more than $2000 CAD.\n\nEDIT: In case it wasn't clear, this is not meant to be a desktop replacement; I already have one.",
  "Well you need to be aware of the fact that most gaming laptops have a dedicated gpu they are loud heavy and the battery life is 3hours at best and the performance is ass when on battery .\nSo you’ll want something with a powerful igpu like a Ryzen ai 300 series (the Ryzen 7 or 9 models) or the intel core ultra 200 series ( like the ultra 7 258v) these have the most powerful iGPUs currently available. Also their batter life is pretty good.",
  "Don't buy the Zenbook duo. It's more of a gimmick and not a good choice for your use case. \n\nGaming laptops all suffer from battery life. They always need to be plugged in. They don't last long. \n\nYou might want to get something with a modern AMD Ryzen 8000 series CPU. The integrated graphics are good for some light gaming. These CPU are also power efficient so you get good battery life.\n\nAsus Zenbook S16 and Zenbook 14 should be the models to consider. The models with AMD Ryzen CPUs.",
  ">B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nGood luck.",

I currently use a DELL G15 gaming laptop, and its a living hell, heat, noise, you name it. Because of my previous bad experience with gaming laptops, I will not be getting a laptop with a dedicated GPU. As of right now, I have found a lot of laptops which meet the requirements of my uni, they are listed below:\n\n[ThinkPad X9 15 Aura Edition Intel (15ʺ)](https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx9/thinkpad-x9-aura-edition-15-inch-intel/21q6cto1wwca1) \\- For this laptop I customized it, I changed the SSD to 256 gigs, since its cheaper, this allows me to buy a ssd and install it for a lot less. I added the touchscreen feature and windows 11 pro, everything else remains the same. The current price of this laptop with all the discounts is $2,230\n\n[Zenbook S 16 (UM5606)](https://shop.asus.com/ca-en/asus-zenbook-s-16-um5606.html) \\- Online reviews aren't very nice to this laptop, multiple reviews online, youtube, blogs, and even reddit state that because of how thin the laptop is it struggles with heat at the at keyboard, and some people say it overheats too. Keeping that in mind, there are A LOT of positive reviews for it too. The current Price of this laptop is $2,200\n\n[MSI Prestige AI 16\"](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/msi-prestige-ai-16-qhd-laptop-stellar-grey-intel-core-ultra-7-evo-edition-2tb-ssd-32gb-ram-win11/17539020) \\- I haven't done any research for this laptop, however it meets the requirements and looks like a good laptop. The laptop is on sale for $1,800\n\n[HP Omnibook 7](https://www.costco.ca/hp-omnibook-7-copilot-pc-173-in-touchscreen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-7-258v-32-gb-ram-1-tb-ssd-intel-arc.product.4000367750.html) \\- This laptop is selling on costco right now for $1,650. I have heard a lot of good things about it, and it seems very modern, it meets the requirements and for the price its really good.\n\n[ HP 15.6-in Laptop, Intel Core Ultra 7 155H - 32 GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Intel Arc](https://www.costco.ca/hp-156-in-laptop-intel-core-ultra-7-155h---32-gb-ram-1tb-ssd-intel-arc.product.4000329837.html) \\- This is another Costco laptop, from the looks of it, it has almost the same cpu, but differs in screen size, and windows copilot and a few other things.

I just want to get a laptop which will last, has good build quality, and good specs. Having a good screen, a big keypad, etc, is all fun and good, but I'm not sure if its worth an additional $1000 dollars.\n\nI would like to provide a bit for info:\n\nI am going into the tech industry (software dev) but my program requires a few additional courses, in which I will be running VMs, compiling code, etc.\n\nAlso to add onto all of that, I do value a machine that doesn't sound like jet taking off, or is so hot it radiates heat. Battery life matters, weight matters so much, and thickness too! (A MacBook would be ideal but its a mac after all.)\n\nSorry if this post is super unorganized and what not lol, all that being said, below is \"THE FORM!\"\n\n# The Form\n\n**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** $2,500 CAD. Canada\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** No\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Form factor doesn't matter much, a traditional laptop is just fine, and so is a 2-in-1. I value build quality, performance, and battery. If I had to rank it, 1. Performance, 2. Battery, 3. Build Quality.\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Very. Since ill be going all over campus, I want the laptop to weigh under 1.5kg, thickness matters, but not so much. If the device is thin, it feels better, weighs less, and its cool as hell. But sometimes its so thin it can ruin the device. So, yeah i prefer the laptop to be thin, but its not required.\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** Above 15\".\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming?

  "Which affordable laptop to buy? Light gaming and editing? So after countless hours of googling i need some help and advice. i am by no means a computer whiz and honestly trying to fully understand specs is doing my head in.\n\nSo my McBook Air M1 finally died and I have been loving my baby. I do really like the apple design and layout and especially for editing and writing it’s been great. Plus I do think the MacBook displays are just crisper than most laptops.\n\nNow since I only have a laptop I will be doing some gaming on it, I mostly play sims 3 (which ran fine on the m1) and I really like small cosy builder indie games. I also really want to play Crusader Kings and get back into SWTOR. (in an ideal world I would like to play Baldurs gate 3, but I know that will probably take a heavier set up). Which is my main point of wanting to switch over to a windows/ microsoft since most of them aren’t on crossover or won’t run or are just too much of a pain to get working on.\n\nAlso in terms of budget I am just a bit on the lower side and would like to stay und or around £700.

  "Working with text on OLED screen Hello. \nI'm choosing a laptop. Mainly for working with text: ide, Ms office, browser. There are several models that fit my budget (Up to $1500).

The light in the room is off. The main question for me: if I continue to work in such lighting on a new laptop with OLED and reduced brightness. Will my eyes get tired?\n\nIt's just that in the country where I live, there are no laptops with IPS display and new Ryzen. There is only the possibility to order Lenovo Thinkbook 14+ 2025 (it has IPS and Ryzen 365) from AliExpress. But with the duty it comes out more expensive than buying in local stores.",

  "Looking for durable, long lasting, quiet, bright laptop. Doesn't have to be really performant. Good day!\n\n**===== Mandatory requirements =====**\n\n**\\* A good battery life**. So CPU+GPU isn't needed, APU should be enough. For communication, light programming, light 3D design, light music production in Ableton with not many VSTs, and similar tasks. Kind of \"a machine for a student\", I guess?\n\n**\\* A good build quality**. Probably full metal then, right? I don't want to deal with broken hinges and similar problems. I'd like to be able to throw it into my backpack and don't worry too much about breaking it (to an adequate limit, of course).\n\n**\\* A silent cooling solution**. I shouldn't hear fans at all in any tasks except heavy ones: VS+VSC in debug + browser with many tabs opened + etc.; Ableton in high quality with many VSTs. If APU is relatively weak, so it's not able to deliver high performance, but it never makes the laptop noisy too -- alright, that's fine too. It doesn't have to be the latest tech.\n\n**\\* A bright, colorful screen**. I have a bad experience with other laptops (some were older models, some were newer) loosing maximum brightness relatively rapidly. So, as for a typical no-brain consumer, my first though is to battle this with the higher maximum brightness, say 500+ nits. What, in most, but not all, cases, automatically means an OLED screen. What lies along the \"colorful\" requirement. I don't have a huge fear of burn-in, I'm using a Steam Deck OLED since launch and an OLED smartphone for a few years; but feel free to warn me if you see a need, you're welcome. IPS is fine too, but OLED is preferable. But overall, if you think that the idea of battling the problem of \"loosing maximum brightness\" with higher maximum brightness is dumb -- I'm all ears.\n\n**===== Optional requirements =====**\n\n\\* Small pleasant touches that everyone wouldn't be against having in their own laptops. Like a **comfortable keyboard** (I type a lot, like really a lot, well, you see yourself), **precise touchpad** (this would be great, to be able to finally efficiently use laptop without mouse), **nice sounding speakers**, **many ports** (especially USB-C), **fingerprint reader**, **low weight**, **fast and stable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth**, etc. Would be nice to be able to charge it with USB-C port, not DC, but probably that's already included in modern laptops, and I'm just not aware. Okayish webcam (if it doesn't have a shutter -- no problem, I'll glue it with a tape myself 😄).\n\n\\* **I have nothing against ARM** APUs (M1, M1 Pro or Snapdragon; I don't see a need in M2 and newer, but we'll see), but I don't want to be a beta-tester and especially pay for it with my own money. I don't want to have VS/NPM/VST/.NET (not .NET Core) and other more common-usage (old software) compatibility problems. May this even cost me a small(!) downgrade in price, performance, or battery life -- reliability is more valuable to me. So **x64 is preferable**. But if you have pleasant personal experience with ARM -- I'll gladly listen to your arguments, why not.\n\n\\* If the laptop doesn't suck air from the bottom (or does, but not only from there), so I **can calmly throw it on any surface including a sofa or a pillow** \\-- that'd be nice.\n\n\\* **A touchscreen, or even a transformer**. Just a nice feature in some apps, say in Internet browsing, but I can live without it. By the way, I just caught myself thinking that, on practice, transformers may actually be even more durable because of those 360-degree-rotating hinges. I wonder if that's true 🤔\n\n\\* Size? Hm... 14\" is probably alright, but I lean more towards **15\", and even 16\"**. Less portable, sure, but it's worth it. I have a moderately performant device with a small screen already -- my smartphone.\n\n\\* I think **16 GB of RAM** should be enough for a device of such performance. As for the **SSD capacity -- the more -- the better**, depending on the price. To the point of also having a quiet but big (few TBs) HDD inside as well (but that may be too old-fashined and so rarely present nowadays, I assume 😄). **I have no problem with opening a laptop** and replacing the SSD, if I feel satisfied, and I'm going to keep it. Same about adding more RAM in the future (if it's not soldered, of course).\n\n\\* **Antiglare screen coating**. Not a matte, but a slightly matte -- antiglare. After using a Steam Deck OLED 1 TB with such a screen coating I've started loving it and would like to have it here too. If can be purchased separately -- no big deal, I can purchase and apply it myself. But, probably, then better the screen be glossy, right? To not end up being too matte, after applying the external antiglare coating.\n\n\\* **If x64 then AMD APU**. I have trust issues towards Intel. But if you see them pointless -- alrighty, I can try Intel too.\n\n\\* **60+ Hz screen, preferably 120 Hz**. Yes, even OS UI animations become more pleasant to look at.\n\n**===== What about examples I've found already in this subreddit and not only =====**\n\n\\* **Macbook Pro 16\" M1 Pro 16/512 or 16/1024**. Yes, ARM, compatibility problems (potential and confirmed). But if x64 alternatives are much worse and/or much pricier -- seems like I'll have to deal with those problems then, spend personal time on relearning a lot of things (never used Mac before).\n\n\\* **Macbook Air 15\" M2 16/512 or 16/1024**. Older 13\" is way too small. And this is at the same price as a Mac Pro higher, so I don't see a point in this one.\n\n\\* **Asus Zenbook 14 OLED UM3402YA**. A lot of complaints on the noise, but an interesting variant.\n\n\\* **Lenovo Yoga 6/7, Yoga Slim 6, Yoga Pro 7, Yoga Slim 7 Pro**. Brightness looks very low (300-400 nits), but except that -- this is the closest I've found. There are complaints about noise too, but, in comparison, there seem to be not as many of them (of complaints).\n\nThank you in advance and take care of yourself 👋 Ready to answer more aiming questions if needed. Will look for it in Europe. Budget: \\~€1000 for something interesting just not performant, \\~€2000 for something both interesting and performant (Mac Pro).\n\n**===== Updates =====**\n\n1.

  "Is Snapdragon X Elite the M chip alternative we've been waiting for?

I think Prism ARM translation layer is just if not more important than what Snapdragon X can deliver in terms of performance, and I have a feeling it'll be what ships only with Windows 11, which is going to step up telemetry a notch compared to Win10, especially because Copilot comes baked in.\n\nI just hope they don't f' this up because they are greedy about user data and shoving Copilot and AI features down our throats when we really want a competitive laptop.\n\nAlso I hope they step up their game with x86 emulation really fast, because they are 4 years behind at this point.\n\nPersonally I'd be satisfied with a M2-M3 comparable performance and efficiency with a replaceable SSD at sub 1500$.

  "I'm relieved snapdragon entered the PC space. It's fantastic to have the options and competition. \n\n\nHowever, it's not a slam dunk. This looks like it will make for a good laptop that most can use without knowing it's arm. But, it's not THE chip to get like M1 was when it came out. It's just another chip with relatively decent showing.",
  "The gpu is a bit weak if you need it. It seems to be fast enough for 4k video editing so not half bad. For gaming it's rubbish. In one review they show the base m3 is equal or worse in all multi thread loads and battery is similar. The price is the kicker. You can get a lenovo yoga slim 7x with 32gigs of ram and 1tb of storage for 1700 eur while a similar macbook pro 14 is 2700 with only 24gigs of ram. The lenovo has a better keyboard, has oled, user upgradable storage. Nobody buys a base macbook and and the options are shockingly expensive. I've ordered the lenovo and can't wait to receive it! I've worked on a m1 mb pro for 9 months and I also can't wait to switch back to windows. But that's more subjective I suppose.",
  "Not going to lie, Qualcomm and Microsoft did themselves a huge disservice with expectation management with these chips.\n\n\nRight now I am there target audience, my daily driver is a fucking heavy razer blade 16\" which has become a glorified remote desktop machine, so I'm looking for an ultra-portable that has OK performance, can drive a 4k external display, and isn't tethered to the wall.\n\n\nBasically looking for exactly what these snapdragon laptops provide.\n\n\nI'm just left with a bad taste in my mouth when they've already massively MASSIVELY overhyped the performance and battery power of these chips. At least from what dave2d showed off, under heavy load, it sees no battery advantage, and in real world testing, it shows almost no performance advantage native, and the emulated performance hit will eat whatever advantage exists.\n\n\nSo in reality, it's a slightly cheaper variant, less supported, equal footed competitor to other x86 laptops, which is a massive achievement, but not the \"!!game changer!!\" That was promised.\n\n\nThrow in windows 11 shenanigans, unknown Linux support, and the inherent risk that some of the very bleeding edge libraries my work depends on isn't and likely will never be arm native and I think I'm going to wait a generation or 2 to see if it gets the support it needs as well as a massively upgraded GPU.",
  "Don't you only use Macs anyways?",
  "All these laptops still have a fan unfortunately.",
  "it's funny, people are knocking it for gaming performance in reviews but honestly, gaming without dedicated graphics? Unless it's 2d of course",
  "Yeah, I'm in the same boat. This has been a letdown, and we now really depend on Qualcomm and M$ to give us back any performance gains if there are any, but my intuition tells me they already put their best foot forward, and it will only be marginal improvements from here on with SXE, and on paper the higher tier appear only 10% better while most certainly being harder to cool down.\n\nI begin to think this was hyped only because of its lukewarm AI features (Thanks M$), and not that it's comparable to Apple M3.\n\nSo I think there are the following scenarios:\n\n1. Highly unlikely that we see a large increase in performance once drivers become optimized and prism becomes better (although 10% appears to be the performance hit when emulating)\n2. This is a first gen product so sadly there won't be any fanless macbook air alternatives which would prove SXE's efficiency, so what the majority wants could be a second gen product.\n3. Maybe AMD or Intel, later this year, come with a more power efficient solution, and that will be x86 so no need for emulation",

  "Portable Power Stations and Portable Power Bank Information  **DISCLAIMER**: I haven't  bought any of the batteries so I don't have any personal experience but have looked at the reviews from other people online. So you are looking for a way to power your computer and handheld devices. To get started there are two major numbers to look at are mAh (milliamps which is how much power the power bank has) and W (wattage which is how quickly the battery can unload the power out of the powerbank). (Please correct me if I am wrong). Wh or watt hours is usually used for power stations and is the same as mAh.\n\n\n\n**CHOOSE BASED ON NEEDS:** There are two routes you can go, portable power bank or portable power station. A power bank is typically smaller in size, weight, capacity, and power output. This is great to bring backpacking and outdoor activities that require you to travel lightly. Tyey are not intended to charge devices that require high wattage. They are also useful to bring while traveling as most airport securities have a maximum capacity of 100-160Wh. They are convenient enough to bring in a backpack or purse for everyday use in different locations. They usually support USB-C charging and USB-A charging at low wattage and most do not have a AC outlet.  A portable power station is bulkier, has a higher capacity, heavier in weight, and has AC,DC, USB-C, USB A outputs. They are better recommended for cars and camping or setups that require a lot of power. They can output a range between 250Wh from the smallest sizes all the way up to 2000Wh depending on your budget and the setups you want to do. \n\n  \n\n\n**USB-C CHARGING**-  For Watts I would recommend at least 100 W from one output. That would narrow your search down. Ultimately some brands that say \"240\" Watts are not able to maintain that output delivery for very long times at most 10-20 minutes. Having higher wattage is great for charging multiple devices at the same time but may not be needed for everybody's preference. Anything bigger than 40,000 mAh is another price bracket and is not as portable for everyday use as it is bulkier and bigger to carry around. If you want to use it as a UPS (Uninterrupted power supply) you should research if the power bank can input more power than outputting. \n\n  \n\n\n**PORTABLE POWER STATION** If you are thinking of something more permanent that stays in your car I would recommend investing in a power station that would have high Watt Hours and high Wattage so you don't have to continually charge it. However this is targeted for people who want to live out of their car or want to go camping or whatever requirements that they need large amounts of  portable power and have other devices that would require higher Watts.  A power station that stays in the car would be great for long periods of time and would require minimal charging depending on how many devices you need to use. Your laptop states that it has a battery of 90Wh so getting a small portable power station that has 200-300 Wh would charge your laptop 3 times. If you want a portable power station, I think you should want to watch this video to determine how big or small of a power station you want as I have not done research on good brands. \n\n[~Youtube: How to Pick the BEST Portable Power Station for YOU \\*Unsponsored\\* by ReeWray Outdoors~](https://youtu.be/NWWI9DgT8qM?si=JPpOPJ5IuSRl_rzE)\n\n  \n\n\nBelow are my recommendations that don't take into account prices so it would be good to look at the prices on multiple stores.Typically USB-C charging portable power banks will range from $50- 200 while portable power will range from $175-1000 so if budget is a concern you should take that into account.  If you want to go for popular and more known brands I would recommend ANKER. If you want something for portability  and your device supports USB-C I would recommend any of the bottom listed ones.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PORTABLE BATTERIES WITH USB-C OUTPUTS:**\n\n**-MOST AMOUNT OF POWER OUTPUT WITH REASONABLE PORTABILITY :**\n\nAnker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W)\n\nCUKTECH 20 Power Bank 25000mAh 210W MAX\n\nUGREEN Nexode Power Bank 25000mAh 200W\n\nAnker Prime 20,000mAh Power Bank (200W)\n\nZMI PowerPack No. 20, QB826G Ultra Laptop Power Bank Worldwide Ed. 25000 mAh PD Max 100W Single Port, Max 210W Total, USB C Portable Charger for MacBook Pro & Laptops That Receive Charge via USB C\n\n- Many of these are not able to output the full 200-250W and are able to output at most 140W from a single device.\n\n**GOOD MIDDLE GROUND THAT STILL OUTPUT ENOUGH WATTS:**\n\nUgreen 145W 25000mAh for Laptop-3 Ports Power Bank\n\nINIU B64 140W 27,000mAh\n\nAnker 737 Power Bank (PowerCore 24K) 140W\n\nUGREEN 100W 20000mAh Power Bank\n\nCUKTECH 15 Power Bank 20000mAh 150W MAX\n\nShargeek 100 25,000 mAh 100W\n\nBaseus Power Bank, 20000mAh 100W PD Fast Charging Portable Charger\n\nINIU Power Bank B63 100W 25,000mAh\n\n**GOOD BUT LOW mAh:**\n\nCUKTECH 10 Power Bank 10000mAh 150W MAX\n\nAnker Prime 12,000mAh Power Bank (130W)\n\n**GOOD WITH HIGH mAh:**\n\nAOHI Starship 2-in-1 40000mAh PD3.1 140W Power Bank & Power Station\n\n**HAS A AC OUTLET:**\n\nGoalZero Sherpa 100\n\nAnker 511 PowerHouse\n\n",

  "Looking for a Linux-compatible, high-performance laptop with great battery life for work in bioinformatics and ML I've been using Linux as a main OS on my PC for a long time and have become very accustomed to it, especially GNOME and its customizability. Most of my work involves Python programming (running and testing large-scale ML apps in PyCharm and Jupyter), as well as using various bioinformatics tools (alignments, genome and transcriptome assembly, metagenomic-related pipelines). I need a laptop for the exact same purposes to be more portable so I can can not be tied down to my PC.\n\nHere's what I'm looking for:\n\n* 15+ inch screen\n* Great battery life\n* Powerful CPU\n* 16+ GB of RAM\n\nI've considered the MacBook Pro with M1 Pro or M1 Max, as they seem to offer some of the best autonomy on the market (please correct me if I'm wrong). However, I'm not sure I'll like the macOS since I'm so used to Linux and GNOME. I've heard macOS isn't very customizable, and a few reviews I've watched suggested that I may not be comfortable with the workflow of this OS. I won't be playing games on it, so I think my best choice would be an autonomous non-Mac laptop with similar or better specs (if such a laptop exists), so I can install Linux on it.\n\nCould you suggest some models that fit these requirements or perhaps convince me to choose a MacBook?

  "Laptop Purchasing Guide & Q+A - Holiday 2019 Edition! Hey there, r/laptops!\n\nTo preface, I am a laptop refurbisher that has poured several hundred hours into working on (repasting, liquid metalling, undervolting CPU/GPU, upgrading panels/storage/Wi-Fi cards, etc.) several dozens of different laptop models over the last \\~18 months, which include some of the following:\n\n* GIGABYTE Aero 15X\n* Razer Blade 14 & 15\n* Many Dell Latitude and Inspiron variants\n* XPS 13 & 15 Variants\n* HP Elitebooks\n* Various Thinkpad variants\n* Various Alienware variants\n* Surface Book 2 13.5\" and 15\"\n* MacBook Pro 13\"/15\" (2013-2015 variants)\n* Acer Helios 300\n* Acer Nitro 5\n\nThe list goes on, but I think this list covers the majority of laptops that are being purchased regularly in the past few months, secondhand or otherwise.\n\nI wanted to spread some of the knowledge I've accrued over the last year and try to help people that may be hunting for a new laptop this Black Friday/Holiday or looking for one as a gift for a loved one/friend/family member.\n\nI'm going to keep the guide itself short and sweet, and provide my recommendations for each \"genre\" of laptop I can think of, with some light rationale behind my choices.\n\n**Best \"Jack-Of-All-Trades\" Laptop (Including gaming):**\n\nGoing to have to go with the Aero 15 variant from GIGABYTE on this one. It has the same footprint as the XPS 15, which is already quite compact, while sporting some powerful GPUs and color-calibrated 144Hz or 4K panels. It also rocks a 94WHr battery, making it an amazing productivity machine whilst on the go thanks to Optimus. Many of their units have went on sale on Amazon in the last few weeks, including the 1660Ti unit and the RTX 2070 mQ unit, both being awesome choices for gaming and video production/acceleration. **Runner-up choice for me is the Razer Blade 15, but ultimately loses due to a higher price point and smaller battery.**\n\n**Best \"Dedicated Gaming\" Laptop:**\n\nThis one is a no-brainer for me. If portable gaming (at a desk) is the sole purpose of buying a machine, I am going to have to go with the ASUS Zephyrus S, specifically the unit with the keyboard shifted downward to make room for cooling. This machine can be configured all the way up to an RTX 2080, and has pretty much unparalleled cooling capabilities, making it my favorite choice, as many of the other thin/lights struggle with cooling the CPU when its pulling 45W and above. Look at some reviews from BOAT or OwnOrDisown and you'll see exactly how cool this thing runs! **Runner-up choice for me is the 17\" variant of the Lenovo Y740, which had even better thermals than the Zephyrus at a lower decibel rating, at the expense of a \"meh\" build quality and chonky bezels.**\n\n**Best Ultraportable (13-14\") Laptop:**\n\nXPS 13, specifically the 9360 configured with 8th-generation i5s/i7s. The 9370/9380 no longer have a USB-A port, which is super important to have to avoid having to bring a dongle everywhere you go, but still has a USB-C port to charge with. It's still incredibly small, has a great keyboard layout, and amazing screens, like the rest of the XPS lineup. It also still has upgradeable SSDs, unlike the 7390. Not to mention the amazing battery life of the 1080p variant!\n\n**Best Ultrapremium Laptop (No/light gaming):**\n\nFor the money, you can't beat a good deal on a refurbished XPS 15 9570/7590! They are very easy to service, have insane battery life for the FHD AND 4K variants, and offer excellent CPU performance for its size with some undervolting. I know there are some QC issues acknowledged in the Dell subreddit, but that is why I always recommend buying a refurbished unit, which go through more rigorous QA testing than new units do, and also come with a 1y warranty that is upgradeable. **Runner-up choice would be a similarly spec'd Thinkpad X1 Extreme, but is typically more expensive than the XPS and the 1080p screen is only 300 nits, compared to 400 and 500 for the XPS 15. It also has a smaller battery, but does weigh less.**\n\n**Best Hybrid/2-in-1/Artist Laptop:**\n\nAlthough pricey, the Surface Book 2 (with the dGPU base) is absolutely extraordinary for what it can do. It has insane battery life despite its ridiculously bright screen and high DPI, great color accuracy and responsiveness for drawing/content creation, and enough horsepower to get most people through about anything. Of course, you can't really open/service this thing, so plan on buying an extended warranty if possible to protect your investment. Also, it seriously has such an amazing keyboard, it is such a pleasant experience to type on! My only nitpick is that the GPU runs quite hot when under load since the fan curve is super conservative unless you change the power plan to \"Best Performance\". **Runner up would be the XPS 15 9575 with the i7-8705G and Vega M graphics for me, but falls short in battery life and its versatility when compared to the tablet mode of the SB2.**\n\nThat's about all I can type without cramping up for now \\^ \\_ \\^\n\nThus, feel free to comment any questions you may have about any model laptop you've been looking at/comparing against, where to find a good deal on a specific unit, what specs someone may need depending on workflows, anything you may need help with this Holiday season :)",

I'm looking to splurge on a laptop that'll last me for the next ~5 years or so. This is my first time buying a laptop; my family used and old Compaq Presario which was new in 2006 when we bought it and we're still using it today! We use a PC for most things but I really do need one for college now. \nI'm looking for a beefy machine that can play games at ~120fps, 1Tb SSD, with a good graphics card (based on what I saw on shopineer, an RTX 2080 seems the way to go). I'm also taking up video editing as a hobby and am planning on doing a post-grad in machine learning as well, so ideally I'd want a powerful GPU (which seems to be taken care of by the RTX 2080) and a powerful CPU as well (Intel i9?). 32 GB RAM (or 64 built-in) is a must as well. I'm also looking at dual-booting with a version of Windows called LTSC, which I hear is reliable and non-bloaty and Ubuntu 16.04. What laptops would you recommend?",

So should I go for i7 9750 or something less efficient. ?\nReliability is one of the most important thing. I hope using my purchase for at least 5 years.",
  "Thanks for this post! Very helpful. I'm interested in the ultra-portable/premium group with touch screen support, at least 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD, decent battery life, with some ports (or minimum thunderbolt for decent docking or eGPU) and deciding between the XPS13 (or 2-in-1), HP Spectre x360, or RBS. All seem to have new updates for late 2019, and I'm currently leaning toward the HP Spectre. Have you had experience with HP Spectre machines and quality or issues? Thoughts on any of HP's \"business\" models that fit in the same niche?",
  "If gaming at a high refresh rate is a priority, I would still go with an Intel H-series 45W CPU, as they have much larger caches and better single-threaded performance than the Ryzen 7 3750H counterpart.

  "Fresh install of windows. I wouldn't say it's necessary to go any further than that. An SSD would be a great addition but I wouldn't say it's necessary because the HDD is compromised or anything.",

(Different GPU, 2060, and just 1 1TB SSD)\n\nThe laptop is pretty good for what I use it for. I have been able to run every game I have wanted so far. The battery life does not matter because it is a gaming laptop. I get about 4 hours before I need to recharge my laptop again. That does not really bother me because I use this as a portable desktop. I never plan to use this near people due to the jet engine sounding fans. \n\nThe battery life for the legion does not matter because it seems it was geared more towards a portable desktop if that makes any sense. I travel with this laptop just fine, but I won't whip it out and start typing a report on the train. It does weigh quite a bit and barely fits into most backpacks. \n\nI hope this makes sense and gives you a rough idea to how I experience the laptop.",
  "Battery life is pretty abysmal on the Y740, but pretty much outperforms the MSI in every other way (thermals, noise levels, etc.) \n\nThe MSI is also lighter, but is nearly impossible to upgrade/maintenance with ease due to the inverted motherboard.\n\nBecause I am so keen on servicing my own laptops and I hate inverted mobos, I'd choose the Lenovo despite its shortcomings.",
  "I'd go with that HP Envy you linked; they are basically the HP Spectre, without the Spectre pricetag, and use mostly the same materials in their build.\n\nAs far was what to watch out for, just make sure all the ports work, there are no dead pixels, and that the thermals under load are acceptable. If all those check out, you should be good to go. \n\nThere really is no way to validate/check if a motherboard is about to die, but you can check the health of a hard drive with CrystalDiskInfo when you purchase a refurb! :) Sometimes there's some leftover manufacturer warranty on those refurbished units as well, check the S/N when you purchase one and see if you get lucky!",

  "I've owned two Razer Blade 15s in the past year, and I found the build quality of the machine to be exceptional, on par with a MacBook Pro. Zero chassis flex anywhere, sturdy hinges, the whole 9 yards. I think the challenges and issues that arise with those machines come from a lot of the heat introduced from the CPU and GPU that gets dissipated to the rest of the machine, particularly the VRMs and the motherboard. If you do a good job with keeping thermals in check, I think the Razer Blade is just as capable in the longevity department as any other brand, bad luck aside.",
  "I LOVE THINKPADS! The X1 Carbon is such a badass machine with an amazing keyboard, and is super lightweight. I had a 7th gen X1C and fell in love with it, wishing I could keep it but couldn't pass up the profits from selling it.",
  "The Precision will have a bigger battery, be slightly lighter/smaller, and probably throttle a bit more under dual (CPU+GPU) loads.\n\nThe P53 will definitely be a better choice for heavier, more consistent loads for rendering/AutoCAD, as long as you don't mind the extra weight of the machine. It has a 90WH battery, too, so its not like it won't last a long time either.\n\nI'd go with the Lenovo in your case.",
  "Any laptop that is thin/light that houses an i9 will throttle, so its often recommended to save the money on the CPU and put it towards the GPU for a gaming laptop, so we should probably stick with an i7-9750H, instead.\n\nHow important is battery life to you? How thick (or thin) can this machine be?",
  "I actually just never have used it or had my hands on one personally, so I don't really know much about it outside what I've read. Thats the only reason :)",
  "Ah mate brilliant, helped a ton! Like I said it would've been a dice roll in the end. Will look at the fund situation when I'm ready to make a purchase, the Zephyrus and the Helios have around £200 difference at the moment and both are equally tempting haha.\nThanks again man.",
  "New SSD with a new install of Windows. All worries of a virus should be crushed by then. :)",
  "i was thinking the mobile i7-9750h would be more than enough and is at reasonable price point currently. also the rtx 2070 mobile and 2070 max Q mobile seem at a good cost to benefit ratio too. was thinking the non max-q 2070 mobile if the thermals are ok.",
  "Thank you!",
  "Thanks for the comment! The last time I had a laptop were like 1st or 2nd gen Intel; so I really want to get something that has solid build quality and will last.  UHD Screens tend to eat up a lot of battery life; I wish MicroCenter had the normal 1080p screen, but it's pretty difficult to find an MX 150/MX 250 with good build quality on a budget! \n\nThe conservative side of me is leaning towards the UX433 or maybe a slightly upgraded Envy via HP.  I don't really need a 4K screen or a touchpad -- they're just really cool as a value proposition.",
  "Hi thanks for the reply! Yes all electronics will be more expensive here. For example a macbook air is $1449 CAD vs $999 USD (approx)\n\nThe Intel i5 version of this laptop is $999 CAD on sale (integrated graphics, 8gb ram, 512gb ssd).",
  "Thanks for the info!",
  "How does it compare to the XPS 13 in your opinion?",
  "No problem :)",
  "Great thanks! So there's no way of storing a virus on the motherboard or ram?",
  "Would the 17\" Lenovo Y740 work for you? The 2080 Max-Q variant can be had for sub-2k when it goes on sale, and performs amazingly well, as the max-fan mode grants the GPU 10 more watts to use under load, and the thermals on my last unit were absolutely fantastic. It benched better than most desktops!",
  "Oh, I would definitely go with the $849 Ryzen version and upgrade it to 16GB of RAM if it isn't soldered then!",
  "X1C has a better keyboard and slightly better thermals under load, but is louder and has a dimmer screen (when comparing FHD to FHD and 1440p from Lenovo to 4k from Dell). It also has slightly worse battery life, if I recall correctly.\n\nXPS 13 definitely has a better screen and is quieter under most loads, and the 1080p variant of it lasts forever on battery, nearly 12 hours in a web surfing test performed by Notebookcheck.\n\nI'm also pretty sure the XPS is cheaper by a few hundred dollars, especially if purchased at the right time from the Dell Outlet.",

  "Gigabyte AERO 15X v8 with 4K Screen - REVIEW \\***Update**: Pictures [https://imgur.com/a/MehhIOW](https://imgur.com/a/MehhIOW)\\*\n\n**Disclaimer:** This review is incentivised by Gigabyte offering $20 of Steam credit upon writing an \"online review\". It does not govern the content in any way, so any positive and negative thoughts are completely my own.\n\n**Context**\n\nI’ve been an Apple guy for a good 15 years. I never thought i’d get a Windows laptop, but after my 2008 MacBook Pro packed up and I went freelance, I needed a high\\-power machine, so I started to do some research. I’m a ‘content creator’, so I’m often working with 4K footage, high\\-resolution photography and motion graphics. At work we had iMacs which were just about ok at handling this type of content, but there was often some lag.\n\nI was very close to pulling the trigger and getting the new MacBook Pro 15”, but decided to shop around a bit. I wanted a laptop which had a great screen for my photo work and was powerful enough to chew through 4K footage. I enjoy gaming, but I would not consider myself a hardcore gamer, \\(I’ve always played on consoles\\), but the idea of having a laptop which I could game on when I was travelling was exciting.\n\n**Settling on the Aero 15X**\n\nI spent months going back and forth as to whether I would go with Gigabyte’s Aero 15X. In the lead up to the release of the new 15X, there were so many reports of issues with the machine. From faulty hardware, screen bleed, to bad customer service, things weren’t looking good for the brand. I was strongly debating to go with Dell’s XPS 15. But the idea of having a seriously powerful laptop with a 4K screen, \\(which is Pantone calibrated\\), were things I couldn’t just turn away from. So I made up my mind and bought the damn thing, then stopped reading any negative reviews to help reduce my pangs of anxiety.\n\n**First impressions**\n\nThe laptop comes out the box and I’m impressed. It looks great, and it’s not too heavy. I didn’t want a laptop which screamed, “I’m a gamer”, so this is perfect. The screen feels nice to open and when it starts up the 4K screen looks stunning. So far, so good.\n\nThe laptop comes pre\\-installed with Windows 10 Pro, coming from Apple it took some time to familiarise myself, but now it’s just about ok. The OS felt a tad buggy, so I fresh installed Windows straight away, then downloaded the drivers from Intel and NVIDIA. I also installed Lenovo’s touchpad driver which vastly improves the touchpad performance. Everything now works smoothly.\n\n**Build**\n\nThe laptop feels premium. So on that front I’m pleased. I’m not 100&#37; happy about the keyboard, the keys are oddly shaped and i’m currently mistyping way more than i usually would. I hope this is something i’ll naturally adjust to. Also, my W key popped off yesterday, it clicked back on fine, but I was a bit like, ‘I just paid a lot for this, that *shouldn’t* happen’. It actually just popped off again. Is there an easy fix for this?\n\nThe touchpad, even with the update isn’t as silky smooth as Apple’s. When working with photography i often use a Wacom or a mouse, so it doesn’t bother me too much \\- but i do wish it was a bit bigger.\n\nThe screen is glorious. I don’t regret dishing the extra dosh for the 4K, it’s been great so far for my photo and video work. The screen calibration is super useful too. I don’t want to speak too soon, but, the screen currently has no bleed \\- hallelujah. I don’t really have a need for the webcam, but I tested it today and I can confirm it’s an awkward position and the resolution is pretty pathetic, so much for my camming career.\n\nThe speakers are unimpressive. I hate to keep comparing it to MBP, but i had hoped the sound would pack a bigger punch. It sounds a bit tinny, and echoes of the surface you’re on. Perhaps I can fix this with an EQ?\n\nThe laptop has a great number of ports which is dreamy for me. No problems here, some people have complained the ports are very tight, but I haven’t encountered this.\n\n**Performance**\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, my key requirement for this laptop was to be able to handle large, high resolution files and boy does this baby perform. Even on a high specced iMac I couldn’t playback 4K smoothly, but I can now edit and playback full res 4K footage. Even though i’d edit it at ½ resolution, it means i no longer need to create proxies. I did a test export of a 3 minute film, 4K with a grade and it finished exporting in 2min54. This is very impressive by my standards. I’m able to work between three different photo editing programs, Lightroom, DXO and Photoshop and everything runs smoothly. Some files I work with are around 150mb tiff files, and it handles it fine. So in this sense, the Aero massively outperforms the MBP. Double thumbs up.\n\nAs stated before, I’m not a hardcore gamer \\- however i think this laptop might convert me. I bought a beautiful game called \\*Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, \\(\\*which I later found out is available on PS4\\), and even though it’s not a 4K game, the laptop ran it very smoothly and it looked great. I’ll let another user review the full gaming capabilities as I don’t know exactly what to look for. I even played the game with my PS4 controller, don’t hate me. If anyone has some game suggestions, I’d love to hear them.\n\nI’ve generally been running the laptop in *High Performance* mode since i’ve been doing a lot of editing the past 2 days, and i’ve generally had it plugged in. I have unplugged it to see how it performs; when doing labour intensive work such as editing or gaming, the battery lasts around 4hrs. If I’m just browsing the web and writing, it’s around 8.5 hours. I expect the battery life is not as impressive due to having the 4K screen version. In general I’d prefer it to be better, but it’s OK.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs you’ve probably guessed, I’m going to keep the laptop. Its performance is far greater than the best MBP and it’s cheaper. Here are the main pros and cons:\n\n**PROS:**\n\n* It’s very fast and very powerful. It’s made 4K footage a joy to edit.\n* The screen is stunning, especially for editing photo work. The Pantone calibration is the cherry on top.\n* It looks and feels premium.\n* Charges very quickly.\n* Gaming on this thing is going to be dreamy. Goodbye social life.\n\n**CONS:**\n\n* The touchpad isn’t the best\n* The keyboard is a bit frustrating. Feels like i’m typing on a ‘travel size’ keyboard. And the W key popped off.\n* The speakers could have been so much better.\n* Noisy fan when pushed performing labour intensive tasks.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or would like me to check something for you. As you might have figured, i’m not the most techy person, but I'll do my best.",
  "Did you save the calibrated color profile before doing a fresh install? I'm pretty sure it would get rid of the calibration if you reinstall Windows. At least logically that would happen unless Gigabyte did some weird magic.",
  "I currently have the 1080 version of the Aero. It's got too much bleed for me. \n\nI've got to decide if i want to return it. Return it for another 1080p version, or try the 4k version. \n\nI'm typically a high\\-res kinda guy and absolutely hate 1080p, however for gaming the high refresh rate is absolutely wonderful.\n\nColor me torn, could you post some pics of the display? Maybe showing black and the lack of bleed?              ",
  "Received the Aero 15x today and here are my thoughts so far\n\nThe laptop is nice and very well made. Feels solid and to me I quite like it. Holding it on one hand it still feels solid albeit not that light either.\n\nThe build that comes with the laptop is ok. There is a fair amount of preloaded stuff but I must admit the smart update tool Gigabyte have installed makes it handy to quickly get all your drivers up to the latest and greatest. Makes driver updates painless almost.\n\nthe keyboard well, this one will take a little getting use to. As outlined its a little squashed and this is due to them squeezing in the numberpad from what I can tell. I dont think many laptop users actually want a number pad and not sure why this was put in place. I have found myself punching in the wrong keys or missing the odd key here and there. I guess it will take time but then its a nuisance when transitioning from laptop and desktop to laptop.\n\nThe 4k screen is nice, beautiful and clear. I cant say enough about how good it is. It is like the other screens on the surface or apple, probably not but its as good as you can get from my untrained eye.\n\nThere is not much sound comming out of the laptop and even at full throttle its not much of a concern.\n\nOverall I recommend this to anyone who is tossing this over the MSI GS65. This in my opinion beats it.",
  "Kinda disappointing about thermals and fan noise, but once your repaste and undervolt, it turns into a silent killer that pumps out ludicrous frame counts",
  "Is the performance on battery worse than having it plugged? Some laptops if not plugged have a crappy performance.",
  "Thanks for the review. The laptop sounds perfect for video work. Did you preorder? \n\nI'm between getting the aero 4k or the msi gs65, but I have to buy by the end of the month so unless the aero becomes more widely available my mind may be made for me. Anyone know who's got stock now?",

  "Hey tomaplaw!\n\nI would like to now more about the battery life..\n\nWhat is the battery when you do different daily tasks like surfing, writing, watching movies etc. ? On the 1080p model there are many reviews which say the Aero would last for 6-8 hours for daily tasks.\n\nWhat is your experience in general for the 4k model?\n\nThanks !",
  "Hey. You said you switched fro mac os to aero 15x. I am going to do the same. How is the experience so far. Is aero 15x laggy? Do you miss the MBP? And is the 4k screen better than the retina screen? Thanks for the detailed review btw. I am eyeing the same 4k model.",
  "I would love to be able to get the 4k model with the 1060 instead of the 1070 as I'm not a gamer and would prefer to extend the battery life.",
  "I had 1 important question. If you gonna repaste your laptop will it void your warranty ? Or not ",
  "Yes I made sure to keep the profile. Reinstalled fine. ",
  "some EVOCs provide a nice compromise. You can get a QHD 120hz screen on a laptop which is quite nice. \n\nJust putting it out there. I personally don't think FHD is a big issue.",
  "same thing here, can you post pics of a black wall paper? i want to see this no backlight bleed",
  "I thinj undervolting is enough for most of the people. Repaste the laptop is i think for people a to much asked ( iknow it’s easy to open) maybe they do it wrong or break something. ",
  "The performance so far has been as good. ",
  "I did preorder. I’m in the UK though. I believe a few stores have it in stock. For video work it’s really doing wonders. ",
  "Here are some pictures, i've included a shot of the screen display. Hope that's OK: [https://imgur.com/a/MehhIOW](https://imgur.com/a/MehhIOW)",
  "The screen is matte. Great for digital design work. ",
  "For daily tasks the battery lasts a similar time, around 7 hours. When video editing it drops down to about 3-4. ",
  "Hi,\n\nHonestly, I don't miss the MBP at all. The Aero is very fast and deals with jobs well which the MCB struggled with. The screen is nice, i used a 5k Mac retina at my work which was better, but it's still very impressive for a laptop. I also prefer the matte over the gloss, especially when editing photography. There's definitely a learning curve with the Aero. e.g, updating drivers etc, (which Mac does so well), but for me it's about performance, and the Aero does deliver. I admit i was a bit pissed off when the new MBP was announced, however it sounds like it's having some issues with performance. So yeah, if you won't miss the apple experience, then go with the Gigabyte. Hope that helps. ",
  "From what I understand the aero has optimus which switches graphics card to integrated GPU if its graphic intensive tasks such as gaming or video editing.\nSo if you are talking about regular tasks such as browsing web and searching Netflix in theory both 1060 and 1070 should have same battery life.",
  "You'd have to dig into Gigabyte's warranty policy or ask a rep to get a definitive answer on that.\n\nHowever, many system builder resellers (gentech, xotic, etc.) will repaste for you and give a warranty that covers the services and parts they modify and it won't void your gigabyte warranty because they're authorized to do it.",
  "As in, you don't care for more than 1080p?\n\nWere you talking about something like this? http://www.hidevolution.com/evoc-p950er-1070-max-q.html\n\nUnfortunately that's about half the battery of the aero.\n\nAny experience with them?",
  "Is undervolting a relatively simple process?",
  "I agree. I would recommend you take the laptop to a third party to do it for you for a fee. A liquid metal repaste would give such a drastic decrease in temps that it's usually worth the low risk",
  "Where did you buy it from mate? I'm in the UK too. ",
  "thnaks!",
  "Impressive for the 4k model tho ! There was a review on trusted review I think where they claimed that the battery life for daily tasks last only about 3-4 on the 4k Aero!\n\nI am glad to hear the opposite ",
  "Yes. It helps. Thanks for the detailed response. I am looking into new 2018 macbook pros little more as well, as I am not a heavy gamer. I do use my current macbook pro for light gaming and I plan to build a desktop as well. I will make my final decision next week. ",
  "True!\n",
  "No, that EVOC is a FHD 120Hz.\n\nAs an example, this one has an option of QHD(2560X1440), 120hz, 5ms response time AND G-sync which is a fairly amazing package allaround - combining higher resolution than FHD with 120hz on a laptop.\n\nhttp://www.hidevolution.com/evoc-clevo-p775tm1-g-custom-built-gaming-laptop.html\n\nNow, I was saying that I personally feel that FHD is enough for me. I'd rather have more FPS on my 144hz laptop than have UHD or QHD resolutions.\n\nI have no experience with them though.",
  "Yes! It is VERY easy to do, 100&#37; risk free and 100&#37; worth it! Just search up \"\\(CPU NAME\\) undervolting guide\" and follow the instructions",
  "Way easier than repasting lol",
  "Yes and no - unless you consider 5-8C decrease “drastic” - which is why I now recommend undervolting first. My GS65 has Conductonaut LM and Fujipoly pads installed by HIDEvolution and I do not feel it was worth the extra $95...to each their own...",
  "Scan.co.uk",
  "I put the laptop on energy saver mode.  Often have brightness at 50%",
  "Apologies, I just meant that example as the *brand* you we're talking about. I'd never heard of EVOC. \n\nThanks for the link!",
  "Depends if your particular laptop CPU is hitting thermal throttling consistently, a 5-8C decrease can be the difference if you have a hot CPU, or even a single core that runs hot.",
  "To be fair, that drop is a pretty good amount. The difference between 97 degrees on load and 89 is a sizable jump. It is USUALLY dependent on the laptop. Laptops that throttle stock benefit the most, mostly thin and light gaming devices",
  "Cheers mate. Waiting for my FHD model myself, from Amazon. Sent one out but never arrived... So a replacement is being sent out. ",
  "Hi tomaplaw,\n\nSince it's been more than 3 months now, are you still happy with the battery life? Do you actually use it for 7 hours for daily tasks before it shuts down, or it was based on the windows estimation?",
  "Hi, I’m still happy. But some random bugs have annoyed me, for example I’ve lost control of the brightness on the keyboard. Battery is still great, especially when using Throttlestop. I still get about 7hrs when doing daily tasks yeah. ",
  "That's quite alright for a 4K! I'm still hesitating whether or not I should go for that one or for the Full HD model. I'm content creator as well and I do not play a single game, so of course the 4K makes more sense to me. My concern is the battery life as I live in a van and therefore lack of an endless power supply. How long would you be able to actually use it for video editing before it dies?",
  "Gigiabyte Aero 15X Impressions When I was looking at getting this laptop I had a hard time figuring out if it would suit my needs from the handful of reviews online. Now that I’ve had it for almost a month I want to give my two cents to help any others who like me are wondering if this is the right laptop.\nPlease keep in mind that I am just giving my impressions, I have not run thorough tests on any aspect of this machine. The only point of comparison I have is my last laptop, the late 2015 13” MacBook Pro.\nAlso, there are some great video reviews that have come out since I got mine, namely [LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9nJjtTnFBo), which I highly recommend watching for a proper look of the thing and also an actual review.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nFor me, a uni student who loves to game but can’t rely on a desktop at home, the Aero 15X is almost perfect. It’s blazed through every game I’ve thrown at it, yet despite all that performance, it can still last me a day of everyday usage at home or at uni with its 5-6 hours battery life. \nThe keyboard and trackpad aren’t the best, but with a bit of tweaking and a bit of time, you’ll have no problems with either.\nOn top of great performance, the Aero 15X has a solid and attractive build, that make it portable enough for school, uni or travelling.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe Aero 15X looks and feels great. Its professional looking with the simple, all black design, yet still has a touch of ‘gaming’ with the subtle carbon fibre finish near the hinge of the laptop and the RGB keyboard. The build quality is also awesome, apart from some hinge issues I’ll talk about in the next part.\nOn top of that, it’s quite small for a 15” laptop, so it still fits snugly in the fairly small backpack I’ve been putting a MacBook in for uni. It’s also much lighter than I was expecting, considering the performance and battery it’s got packed inside.\nIt’s got all the I/O I will ever need; 3 x USB 3.0 ports, a USB-C port, SD card reader, LAN, HDMI, mini display port and of course the headphone jack.\nSome may find the upward facing web-cam to be a disappointment. However, since my only use for the web-cam is video chats with friends, I think it is a worthwhile sacrifice for the miniscule bezels around the screen that make the laptop so small.\n\n**Screen**\n\nI am very happy with the 1080p TN panel on this laptop. There is no noticeable colour shift in normal usage, colours look great, and I prefer the anti-glare coating over the normal glass of the MacBook. The only problems I have with the screen on this computer is its hinge. \nFirstly, the computer detects the screen as closed when its at about 30-35 degrees, often putting the computer to sleep when I just slightly close it to talk to somebody or reach over it. Secondly, when the laptop is closed, the screen and base don’t stay fully shut, so when carrying it you can hear a small rattle which is the laptop opening and closing ever so slightly. This is a bit of a nit-pick, but after having the perfectly built MacBook for so long, it was something that annoyed me a little.\nKeyboard and Trackpad\nThe keyboard on the Aero 15X is a great size and layout (my typing is much more accurate now), however the keys take a lot of force to press. It just doesn’t feel as nice to type or play games on compared to the keyboard on the MacBook. My fingers even get tired after an extended typing or gaming sessions. Despite this, it’s not a bad keyboard and I am sure I will get used to the actuation force after some time.\nThe trackpad on the other hand, is terrible. After using a MacBook trackpad for 2 years, the one on the Aero 15X frustrated me to no end. It doesn’t have support for two-fingered right clicks, gestures and just tracked extremely poorly.\n Luckily, I found a video from [Dave Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2rfwR-IV-c&t=132s) on YouTube where he showed how to improve trackpads by updating the driver to Windows Precision drivers. The trackpad initially had ELAN drivers, but after updating them to Precision drivers, the trackpad became so much more usable. It still isn’t as good as the MacBook, but it works just fine for me now.\n\n**Performance and Battery**\n\nI use the Aero 15X for everything. That includes: taking notes at uni, watching videos (YouTube/Netflix) and gaming (from Overwatch to Witcher 3). The Aero 15X excels when it comes to gaming, yet still does well at everything else. Considering just how powerful this machine is, I find the battery life on it very impressive.\nWhen it comes to games, the Aero 15X has run everything I’ve thrown at it with either max or very close to max settings. The most demanding titles I’ve played are Witcher 3 and PUBG, both of which run buttery smooth (>60 fps) at ultra settings. This is of course when connected to the power supply.\nWhen doing everyday tasks like streaming video or typing stuff up (like this review), I get about 5-6 hours of battery life. This is easily enough for a day of use at home or at uni for me, so it suits my needs just perfectly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAgain, please keep in mind this is just an owner’s impressions. There are plenty of great technical and professional reviews out there online, but I hope some of you find this useful! \nThanks for reading! 😊\n\n&nbsp;\n\nedit: I know there's a typo in the title but this is my first reddit post so I don't know how to edit it :3 pls help",
  "I think the Aero 15 X monitor isn’t TN but rather IPS instead right?",
  "Nice write up!",
  "Thanks for writing your impressions!\n\nHave you considered adding an addition SSD or more RAM?",

  "Hey there, thanks for taking your time to write the review! \n\nI hope you wont mind helping me out a little, Im also going to be a student soon, and also looking for laptop at around 2k range, this laptop seemed like the perfect choice with its battery and hardware, but as Im doing a bit more competetive gaming, I have come to realisation that this would be a huge jump backwards for me from a 1ms response time to 40-50ms on 15x, would you say the response time is noticable in overwatch for example? Cause now Im rather leaning to a asus rog laptop (which I dont remember the model name but it has 144hz, gsync and 5 ms response time on its monitor, while yelding gtx 1070), but that means Im gonna struggle with power badly, but kinda just thought of buying a power bank to battle that..\n\nThanks in advance!",
  "Hey dude, I was wondering how your gigabyte is treating you, and if you've had any experience with customer service yet?",
  "Could you please tell me whatever you can about the viewing angles? That's the only part of this laptop I'm hesitant on. What's it like to move the laptop screen a little bit while keeping your head in the same place? Can you notice a color shift? Glossy-ness? Thanks!",
  "What's the fan noise and temperatures like when gaming, especially after few hours? If you can discuss this in bit of detail would be great plz...",
  "thanks for the review!\n\nbut ugh, i can't decide if i should wait for the 120hz model that is \"coming soon\". might come with the 8th gen chips too.",

  "Definitely will need to add an SSD soon, already used about 70% of the available storage... :(\n\nWon't need more RAM though, I was using 8gb on my old desktop and had no problems so 16 gigs should be more than enough for a while.",
  "XPS 15 only has a 1050 right? the difference in performance between that and the 1070 (albeit a Max-Q) is huge. i would go with the aero because it will last a lot longer before needing to upgrade. \n\nAlthough, im waiting until Gigabyte comes out with 8th gen chips in this series because a 6 core i7 and a 1070 in a slim professional laptop is sorta the dream.",
  "XPS 15 has so many issues, don't bother.",
  "Is there much of a price difference between the models you're looking at?",
  "Are you trying to buy in Australia? The only place it's available from here is Scorptec",
  "Just had a word over email with GentechPC and they mentioned it will be in stock no sooner than April. ",
  "GS63VR doesn't have the battery life for me to use it at uni for a day, so it wasn't one I considered properly.\n\nThe Aero 15X was only just released in Australia (I had it on preorder) so no specials just yet. You may find the Aero 15 on special, but I don't know of any deals, sorry :/",
  "Pretty sure a battery bank wont help you with any gaming laptop, they don't usually have the capacity to charge a power hungry GPU like that.\n\nI play comp in Overwatch, but mainly for fun, and I barely notice a difference between the Aero and my 1ms 120hz Benq monitor. If you're playing at high levels though, I can't really tell you.\n\nLike I said though *I* can't really tell a difference\n\nBtw, do you have a gaming monitor at home? Cause if you do you can always just connect to that for competitive gaming",
  "No problems. Haven't needed to contact customer service at all so far. ",
  "I often use it in bed where I am constantly shifting the viewing angle and I have no issues with it.  The screen has a nice matte finish, not glossy at all.",
  "Have never really thought about it. I guess that means that the fan noises and temps aren't obnoxious. I'll analyse some more next time I'm playing and get back to you.",
  "Hi I'm waiting for that too. Do you no where I'll find a  little bit of info on it please :) ",
  "i probably would've waited for that too but this is the first I've heard of it.\n\nTBH though I'm glad I didn't because I've been waiting for the right laptop for so long that I'm happy to finally have this one.\n\nThis thing is a beast though anyway and 120hz isn't a huge thing for me so if you want a laptop now just go for it!",
  "I know what you mean! But i personally saw way more people saying it was an IPS monitor that people saying it was a TN.\nBut it’s kinda confusing, you right.\nHow are the viewing angles, etc?\n\n",
  "Late to the party, but laptop searching myself. What kinda issues?",
  "About $100 difference but the xps seems to get sales more frequently. ",
  "Thanks but no, Canada or US\n\nNeed 2 for work .. been sluming on my 2012 alienware m18x for way past it's prime.. had to return the latest Dell xps 15 , 1050gtx way underpowered.",
  "Thanks.  I plan on playing on high settings, and capping fps to 60 (as its a 60hz screen :)\n\nIf you can test few games that would be great",
  "There is a tiny bit of colour shift but I need to actually be looking for it to notice it. It's definitely not something you'd notice even using it at awkward angles.\nAlso maybe it's VA?",
  "Yeah that's true, there's sales like every 2 or 3 months. I was looking at XPS 15 aswell but in the end went for the Aero simply cause it's so much more capable at gaming.\n\nDepends whether you want a something more portable for daily use or if you're wiling to make some sacrifices when it comes to battery and portablility for a little extra performance (and cost). \n\nThe latter was my choice, especially since a desktop PC is not really an option for me. ",
  "Cant really help you then :/ gl finding one, you definitely sound in need of a refresh",
  "So the main game I play is Overwatch, and with the sound (even from the laptop speakers) moderately high, I don't even notice the noise of the fans.\n\nPlaying on Epic at 70 fps (the framerate it detects the monitor on for some reason), the GPU temps stay around 80-82 degrees. Not sure about CPU as Overwatch only allows monitoring of GPU.\n\nThe chassis becomes very hot after a few hours of gaming, but not until you put your hand near the back of the laptop. The keyboard, trackpad and places where you actually put your hand only get a little warm. Never enough to give me sweaty hands or anything like that though.\n\nBasically, temps and fan noise are not an issue at all.",
  "Guess it's IPS then cause looking at awkward angles on a TN monitor is pretty much clearly noticeable. :)\n\nIs the latency on the monitor noticeable?\nHow is it to play with 60hz?\n\nDon't know if you ever tried a 120hz but your opinion about that would be interesting! ",
  "It's a VA panel.",
  "TBH I don't notice latency unless it's really bad, i.e. playing on a TV, so no it's not noticeable for me.\n\nI can notice the difference between 120hz and 60hz though, 120hz just looks amazingly smooth, however I prefer higher graphics settings at 60 fps than lower at 120hz. I do prefer playing Overwatch on my 120hz monitor at home though.",

  "My review on Dell Inspiron 16 plus with RTX 3060 (60W) I got mine on Aug 04 2021 on a deal for only $1450. It comes with **i7-11800H, 32gb RAM, 3k display, 1TB SSD with RTX 3060 (60w), thunderbolt 4 and full size SD card slot**.\n\nBeing a professional video producer &amp; editor, I have been in search of excellent windows 4k RAW video editing laptop. I have bought tons of high end laptops in last couple of months and tried each of them with a real-time 4k RAW playback test &amp; 3 minute 4k timeline with multiple layers, color correction, effects, noise and infusions render test.\n\nThe best things about this laptop is the display. This is literally by far one of the most color accurate and sharp 3K display out there on the market. Everything looks darn amazing. The fans are on a bit louder side but you can keep it to quiet mode if you don't like it. But I think with performance mode the fans are understandable. Build quality is good but not great. The material is not XPS quality but it does feel premium. The overall look and design with 16 inch almost bezel less display is pretty awesome. As I prefer matter over glossy, this has clearly one of the sharpest screen on the market.\n\nThis laptop is tuned more towards creators for sure but obviously you can game on it too. But due to 60hz refresh rate this will not likely be a first choice for gamers.\n\nSo here is the real **render time** **result on Adobe Premiere Pro**:                                                                                                       (Prices may not reflect current pricing, these are the prices I bought it for)\n\n\\- **Dell Inspiron 16** plus i7-11800H, 32gb RAM, 3k display 1 TB SSD with RTX 3060 (60w) model = ***3 min 10 seconds*** : Price: $1450\n\n\\- **MacBook Pro 16\"** with 5600M, retina display, intel i9, 32GB RAM, 2 TB SSD  = ***3 min 47 seconds*** : Price: $3800\n\n\\- **Asus Zephyrus M16** RTX 3060, i9 -11900H, QHD, 16GB RAM, 1 TB SSD =  ***4 min 52 seconds***: Price: $1849.99\n\n\\- **Asus Zephyrus G14** with Ryzen 9 5900HS, FHD 144hz, RTX 3060, 16GB RAM, 1 TB SSD = ***4 min 24 seconds*** Price: $1449.99\n\n\\- **Asus Zephyrus G15** with Ryzen 9 5900HS,QHD, RTX 3070, 16GB RAM, 1 TB SSD = ***3 min 37 seconds*** Price: $1799.99\n\n\\- **Razerblade 15 4K OLED** with intel i7-10750H, RTX 2070 max-q, 16 GB RAM, 512GB SSD = ***5 min 38 seconds*** Price: $1699.99\n\n\\- (**Fastest**) **MSI Creator 15 4K UHD** with intel i7-10875H, RTX 2070 Super max-q, 32 GBRAM, 1 TB SSD = ***2 min 14 seconds*** Price: $1699.99\n\n\\- **Eluktronics Mech-15** with intel i7-10870H, FHD, RTX 2070 Super max-p, 16 GB RAM, 512 SSD = ***4 min 30 seconds*** Price: $1699.99\n\n\\- **Eluktronics Max-15** with Ryzen 7 4800H, QHD, RTX 3060 max-p, 32GB RAM, 1 TB SSD = ***3 min 10 seconds*** Price: $1599.99\n\nSo, if you look at the price value. Honestly, this laptop is a great buy. I think for creators, the 16:10 ratio with 3K resolution is the best part of the deal &amp; it does beat lot of high end laptops in playback and render time. There are several other reasons why I returned those laptops mentioned above( except this one) which is hard to explain all in here. But If you want to know, shoot me a message. I'll be happy to help.",
  "Thank you for sharing so much useful info! I’m signing up for Reddit to post this reply. One possible reason for what you observed could be Intel Quicksync doing some of the decode/encode assist. A quick way to validate is to turn iGPU off in bios or device manager. Another reason as you touched on in the comments is Premier optimization. Davinci Resolve Studio is much better at unleashing full GPU horse power. Do you mind sharing which raw codec do you work with? Also if you can post some Pudget benchmarks that would be really cool and standardized (they split by transcoding and effects etc). Thanks again for your post!",
  "Thanks for this!! Would you say it's worth getting the Inspiron 16 Plus over something like the Dell XPS 15 9510? I know the latter is the \"higher\" end laptop but it's processor doesn't seem significantly better than the Inspiron (i9-11900H vs i7-11800H), but the Inspiron's high end graphics card is much better (GeForce RTX 3060 vs the XPS's GeForce RTX 3050-Ti). \n\nI'm a graphic designer/video editor, so I'm looking for something that primarily has a good processor but also has a decent graphics card.",
  "This is a very useful comparison you’ve provided here. Thank you for that. \n\nI’m fairly inexperienced and unaware when it comes to multimedia creation tools and the hardware/software support intricacies. Besides just the wattage of the GPU and CPU, what other factors would influence the render time ? \n\nIs the fact that the Inspiron 16 Plus is able to outperform the G14 entirely due to thermals and wattage ? Or is there something else at play here too ? And how come the Creator 15 is the fastest of the lot, while having last-Gen hardware across the board ? From what I can see, the machines with 32GBs of RAM are the ones that perform the best here.",
  "Great post, thanks. One thing you could do for us all is to set up a Google drive with your project (in XML) and files to share so other people could test more machines and compare to yours? Thank you!",
  "Thanks for the great review! How’s the battery life when doing simple tasks?",
  "Great writeup! If you managed to open up the laptop, do you know whether the 1TB SSD comes in a 2230 or a 2280 form factor?  \nFrom what I see the laptop has [two PCIe slots for SSDs](https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/1/5/csm_MG_4491_f59cd10fbc.jpg), one 2230 and the other 2280.  \n2230 sizes are very difficult to find and a lot more expensive than 2280, so if Dell ships a 2230 by default then that's a great win.",
  "What is battery life in office work usage? Web browsing. Word , excel etc.",
  "Thanks for you insight as well. \n\nYes, I did turned off the iGPU and did the render. The result was same. I mostly shoot in Blackmagic RAW 4k. So, I have been using Da Vinci Resolve studio version a lot. And yes it completely uses GPU and it's a faster and better render program than Premiere pro.  Those tests on Premiere pro was for the office work as they have not moved to Da Vinci yet. \n\nThe pudget benchmarks are not working with Adobe suites at the moment. Whenever it is fixed I'll share it here on the post.",
  "And for my own experience, M1 8gb RAM Mac can export almost as quickly as my 2020 Asus G14 (2060mq) using a73 h264 footage, in Resolve Studio. M1 can even playback 8k h265 footage from Sony a1 in 4K timeline, while the G14 choke due to Nvidia h265 hardware decoder not as good as M1",
  "If you simply look at the graphics, yes RTX 3060 is better. But it’s not always the graphic card that makes your work flow easy. \n\nIf you decide to get all maxed out dell XPS 9510 vs Inspiron 16, then i would say 9510 would be a better choice. But if you want display, processor, graphic card with less money 💰 to spend then Inspiron 16 is better.",
  "I'll answer accordingly.\n\nMe and my colleague have been in frequent contact with Dave2D and JarrodTech on their discord channel. All of them are amazed on how MSI creator 15 outperformed all the high end laptops by miles on the test. Since I do tons of RAW video editing, I have made sure all the settings are perfectly matched and timed.\n\nSo to answer your question, after tons of test I found out, to render that level of RAW codecs with such speed CPU-GPU combination has to be perfectly compatible with each other and work in sync. When I monitored the CPU-GPU usage of MSI or Dell Inspiron 16 for that matter, during render, both were using almost 100% of their limitation of CPU & GPU at the same time while laptop like Asus M16 & Razerblade lacked that level of synchronization. Even manufacturers and engineers are not aware of those details because they only test the basic usage & thermal compatibility when building the machine & not the specific software usage. That's why most of the manufactures send their pre-unit to reviewers and let them test bunch of software on it and find out what works better and what not.\n\nSo, I came to know that it's not always a most powerful gaming laptop that beats the tests. It's the compatibility and the drivers that have been specifically optimized for the task outperforms the other. So laptops that are specifically designed for creators beats out other powerful gaming laptops on those test. I forgot to mention in my post that **MacBook Pro M1** with 16GB RAM & 512 SSD renders that same test in just **4 min 10 seconds** beating out some high end gaming machines. So, you see it's the optimization that works better when using apps like premiere pro and Macs are always known for their optimization of CPU-GPU with the applications.\n\nHonestly I don't have an exact answer to this question on why Dell Inspiron 16 plus was able to beat G14. As i7-11800H in dell is faster than Ryzen 9 5900HS & also Ryzen 9 5900HX which is insane,\n\n[*https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-11800H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HX/m1542191vsm1449683*](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-11800H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HX/m1542191vsm1449683)*)*,\n\nthat might be one reason. In programs like premiere pro, the program tries to render the video using CPU first. If CPU thinks it can handle the tasks then it'll render itself but if it thinks its too much then it'll send the task to GPU. So I think dell's optimized drivers for that application, CPU-GPU synchronization are superior to G14s when using adobe suites. But while gaming G14 will be better because it is optimized for gaming. That's only logical explanation I can think of.\n\nYes, more RAM is always better but in all the test, no render needed more than 16gb of RAM. 11gb-15gb was the maximum utilization during the render. But personally, I believe 32GB is the perfect choice for anything.\n\nI hope I answered your questions.",
  "Hey folks, got mine today, with rtx 3060, 1TB SSD NVMe and 16GB Ram.

  "Nice laptop. If you don't mind, may I ask how much you pay for it for the configuration you mentioned above?",
  "This is great news, thanks for sharing. Honestly the 16 Plus sounds like an amazing machine, can't wait to order mine. Btw I heard the hinges are a bit stiff on this model, is that true?  \nI remember that on my old Inspiron 7537 I had to loosen up the hinges after a few years. They would tighten up over time as you repeatedly open and close the lid. This risks breaking the screen frame.",
  "BTW no need to change anything on the bios. The system will still recognize the 1TB OS ssd as the primary, even if installed on the ssd2 slot. Today I added a 2280 2TB Samsung 970 evo plus on the ssd1 slot and everything's running fine",
  "Amazing, thanks! These are very expensive since the form factor is so niche. Currently about [£150 on Ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/274835097248), opened – never used. So taken from other laptops most probably.",
  "Actually that's a really interesting question. As far as my test goes, I believe dell has outperformed because of it's integrated software & drivers. Also Intel 11th gen processor is in play here. If it was solely based on hardware then Mech-15 with RTX 2070 Super Max-P (130W) on a Beast Mode which has way better hardware & still lost to dell's RTX 3060 Max-Q (60W).\n\nAlso MSI creator 15 (which outperformed every laptop I have tested) has a creator mode, which you can turn on & it adds adobe programs automatically in the lists. So I think, if you really wipe out everything on the Dell and install fresh windows we might see a different result. I'll try that some day and will update here.",
  "I paid 1442eur incl taxes at [dell.es](https://dell.es) for the highest configuration possible and still with Win10. I ordered it end of September and it came yesterday. The \"discounted\" prices are still available, even at 1420 now, though they already come with win11.\n\nhttps://www.dell.com/es-es/work/shop/port%C3%A1tiles-dell/nuevo-inspiron-16-plus/spd/inspiron-16-7610-laptop/bn76109",

  "Intel i3-1215U: what frequency does it reach?

  "Lenovo nerfs it a bit to keep thermals in check. You get steady performance instead of a surge of power then a period of severe throttling. It also helps with battery life.",
  "Well it may make sense but does it really not go further than 2.55Ghz even in plugged in mode?\n\nIs it possible to change the TDP in the BIOS to enable different power limits like 15w, 25w... ?\n\nI mean, form 4.4 to 2.3 that's quite a lot of reduced performance!",

  "A review of the LG gram 16 2 in 1 (2021) Okay, so I managed to get a hold of the LG Gram 16 inch 2 in 1. I have found almost no reviews of the product (and yet I bought it anyway), so I'm writing here if you're considering it. \n\nIn the box:\nThe box came with the computer, instruction manuals, a USB-C to HDMI adapter, and an LG WACOM pen. \n\nAesthetics and Design:\nLike other reviews of the LG Gram 16 inch, the computer is very slick, super thin, and super light. The case is magnesium alloy, so it does have a slight amount of flex in the middle of the chassis. However, I have noticed you have to really be pressing hard to cause an amount of flex that is noticeable. I purchased the product in Canada, so the only colour option available is black. Personally if you have the choice, I would go with silver, because as others have mentioned, the black finish is a bit of a fingerprint magnet. The hinges on the 2-in-1 seem fairly sturdy, and the screen does not wobble when you pick up the computer. Of note, there is considerable flex in the screen. This isn't a problem for typical use, because your really shouldn't be twisting your screen when you use your computer, but it is somewhat concerning. The only thing I think missing from the design is a place to store the pen. I suspect the laptop is too thin to house the pen inside the case itself, but I do wish there were magnets on the side of the device for pen storage. Overall though, excellent design.\n\nBattery:\nThe battery is excellent, but will not last as long as advertised. Doing productivity tasks (office apps, internet, and a few videos), I managed to get the computer to last ~10 hours on 70% brightness and on recommended battery mode. I imagine with the battery saver mode, you could extend this to 15 hours. As well, the model I purchase came with an i7, so presumably those with an i5 will have longer battery run times. There are also LG settings that allow you to turn off the computer fans, which can also extend battery life (at the expense of thermal performance). Compared to the competition for a computer of this size however, the battery life is stellar. I do not believe there is a comparable 15-16 inch 2 in 1 that can last that long on battery alone. \n\nKeyboard and Trackpad:\nThe keyboard and trackpad are something I was initially concerned about, as the trackpad extends beyond the centre of the keyboard. I was worried this would cause my palms to trigger the trackpad. However, I have found that when typing, the trackpad is at a spot where my hand will typically float above the trackpad, thus eliminating the risk of mis-clicks. The keyboard itself is excellent. Given how thin the laptop is, I am surprised how much travel is available. The only downsides I have noticed to the keyboard are the small \"delete\" key, and crammed numpad. I find personally I am always pressing the numpad instead of the \"delete\" key. However, it should be noted the \"delete\" key is only slightly smaller than standard size compared to other laptop keyboards. Nonetheless, I agree with other reviewers in that the keyboard could have been expanded given the amount of room available on the sides of the keyboard. The trackpad itself is also wonderful, and I am glad it is more centred on the deck. This makes it easier to click compared to other computers such as those offered by Lenovo and Dell. Just like the 16 inch non-2-in-1, the trackpad is gigantic. \n\nScreen:\nLG is known for their screens, and I must say, it is a very nice display. The 16 inch 2 in 1 is also among the few laptops to offer a QHD screen (as opposed to FHD or 4k). I find this type of screen offers the best balance between having a good resolution and good battery (I have noticed reviews of 4k laptop models typically report poor battery life, especially on a 15-16 inch screen). I was initially concerned as well that the screen would not be sufficiently bright (when compared to my Surface Pro), but have found this is not the case. Some reviewers have indicated the screen can reach up to 330 nits of brightness, which is consistent with what I can see using the naked eye. In other words, the screen brightness is acceptable. It isn't the brightest on the block, but it isn't a dim 250 nit panel either. However, the brightness isn't sufficient to counteract the glossy screen when placed in sunlight. I suspect the 2 in 1 is the reason all of the 2021 LG Gram lineup comes with glossy screens (as the screen is also touch and pen-compatible). This means in direct sunlight, I find there is too much glare for the laptop to be useable. On a related note, unlike the laptop models, the bezels on the 2-in-1 are entirely glass covered, so there is no magnesium alloy lining the screen. \n\nSound:\nSome reviewers seem to have horror stories about the sound quality from the LG Gram devices. Personally, I have found the sound okay on the 16 2-in-1. It is nothing to write home about, but the trebles are still very sharp, and the volume is good. There is no tinniness to the speakers. Downfiring speakers are usually not preferred, but I can't say the speakers on the device are much worse than the Surface Pro. \n\nWebcam and Ports:\nThe webcam is also nothing to write home about, and is your standard 720p webcam. I do wish there was a front-facing webcam for recording events, but very few laptops have front-facing webcams. It should be noted the device has no IR camera, so Windows Face Recognition will not work on this device. \n\nFor ports, the computer comes with a headphone jack, two USB C ports with thunderbolt 4 (with the charger plugging into one of the ports), a USB-A port, and a microSD card slot. For a 2-in-1 of this computer's height, I would say the port selection is quite good. However, it would never hurt to have additional USB A and C ports. \n\nPerformance:\nI won't comment too much on the performance of the computer, as I haven't and don't intend on stress-testing the computer. I suggest looking at the existing reviews for the LG Gram 16 2-in-1 and laptop versions for that. However, if you're looking for a gaming or video editing machine, this is not the device for you. The computer has no GPU (as advertised), and seems to have a sub-optimal cooling system (per pictures from other reviewers). I believe the cooling is an improvement over previous generations, but the computer still has a hotter idle temperature than my Surface Pro by about 5 degrees. The computer will also get uncomfortably hot when doing demanding tasks. I do hope LG follows the suggestions of other reviewers, and adds another fan and a larger heat pipe to future models of the 16 2-in-1, laptop, and 17 inch laptop. Given the computer comes with an i7, there is a considerable amount of power that is limited by the cooling. \n\nOverall:\nOverall, I feel this laptop is a very solid choice for a niche market. If you are looking for a large-screen 2-in-1, with stronger than average battery life, or a light device, I think this is the computer for you. However, I do feel depending where you are from, there are better options for $2000 dollars or less. In fact, for what is offered, I feel the $2149 price tag is overpriced for what you get. Nonetheless, I do a lot of commuting for work, so I thought it was important to have a lighter computer. Others in other situations may feel differently. As well, In Canada, alternatives like the 15 inch HP Envy x360 or the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro do not come with 16gb of RAM. The HP Envy also only appears to come with the 250 nit screen, which I felt was a bit dim. I thought this was a major selling point of the LG Gram, as it seemed to be among few 15-16 inch 2-in-1s in Canada to have 16gb RAM as standard. If you are in an area that allows for customization, I would suggest the 15 inch HP Envy x360, provided you can get 16gb of RAM, and the 400 nit screen option. This computer will offer better performance compared to the Gram, and is lightly cheaper. Of course, and as mentioned by all Gram reviewers, this computer is no powerhouse. If you intend on using your laptop for heavy video editing, gaming, CAD, etc, you will want to look elsewhere. If you are interested, this laptop is on sale on Amazon.ca for $1699, which I feel is a more fair price for what is offered. If you have any questions, leave a comment!",

  "I currently have both the 2021 16\" 2-in-1 and the 2021 17\" laptop at my disposal. I personally find the 16\" one to be more usable. The 17\" is very light (I think it is actually lighter than then the 16\"), but the size makes it hard to set up on a small place like, say a coffee shop or a class room. The 17\" has the advantage of 1 more USB-A port and HDMI port. The 16\" pretty much requires a separate port extender that would consume one of the USB-A ports on the left.\n\nThis is my first experience with a 2-in-1. I always saw it more like a gimmick, but decided to give it a try after hearing my son's opinion. I like the tent formation to watch videos, it does feel nicer. I also like to collapse it to full tablet mode and turn on the side for internet reading because I like tall layouts more. It isn't super easy to use it like that because of the weight and size, but I am continuing to experiment to see if it grows on me.\n\nNow, I have two strange issues specific to the 16\" 2-in-1. *I'll appreciate if someone chimes in with the solution.*\n\nFirst, the BIOS doesn't have the hidden advanced settings mode accessible via stantand Ctrl+Alt+F7 shortcut. It works on the 17\" laptop and allows to tune thermal settings and a bunch of other advanced things. (*Please don't change anything there unless you know what you're doing! You can damage your computer*). I tried other keys but nothing worked. I find it surprising that these two models don't have an identical BIOS setup. I'd like to be able to get to the advanced settings.\n\nSecond, the 16\" doesn't boot from thumb drives. None of the bootable USB drives I have have been detected by the boot menu. This is a pain because I want to install Ubuntu on it. I was able to boot from a physical DVD drive connected to the USB port, but it takes forever. Again, the 17\" doesn't have this problem. That's another reason I wanted to get to the advanced BIOS settings, maybe there's something there.\n\nBTW, I have Ubuntu 21.04 installed on the 17\" one, and it works very well. Most of the special keyboard keys work, and all of the hardware works too.\n\nFinally, I wanted to mention that all 2021 models have a spare M2 slot, which is good news to me because only could order configs with 512GB preinstalled drives. I am planning to install an extra 1TB drive soon. The preinstalled one is Gen3x4, so I am expecting that anything from that generation will work too.",

  "Hi\n\nCan you please tell us if the SSD drive can be upgraded, is there a second SSD slot in the 16\" lg gram 2021?  \n\nThanks",
  "Thank you for the review",
  "How does this compare to the surface pro 8",
  "I don’t think the rigidity is much better. I haven’t seen the 16 inch laptop model myself though, so I’m basing my thoughts on video reviews. The flex seems to be about the same. The hinge feels quite stiff though, which is good. Not sure how that compares to the 16/17.",
  "Have you tried using the C ports to boot from? I have noticed some strange behaviour from the A port… It doesn’t seem to be able to take a constant signal from my dock, and keeps disconnecting my speaker and keyboard.",
  "You cannot. It is fixed at 16gb, soldered. SSD is upgradeable.",
  "Yes, there is a second slot for ssd to upgrade.",
  "There is a second slot, but LG seals it pretty dang well and they’re very clear about the fact you loose warranty if you do so. They won’t even take your laptop in to make the change themselves, which is quite upsetting. I know this comment is a year old but I’m looking to get one and came across this review.",
  "No clue. I have a Surface Pro 5 and much prefer the larger screen, though the writing experience is somewhat better on the Surface Pro.",
  "Yes, I have tried to boot from the C port using a USB-C flash drive and also a USB-C to USB-A dock, and neither worked.",
  "Thanks for replying i appreciate it.",
  "Thank you",
  "That’s interesting… I’m not technically savvy enough to help you further though. Maybe take a look on Google though. I recall seeing a few posts about guys who were able to load Unbuntu to the Gram.",
  "HP Envy 15 --or-- Dell XPS 15 ? So, this is a little more complex than just 'this' or 'that' because I actually bought an HP Envy 15 nearly 1 year ago. I needed a Windows PC for school/work and require a relatively high performing workstation (or similar to) for 3D rendering and complex GIS computations. After extensive research, the HP Envy was by far my best bet - it was solid on specs, good looking (which is important to me), had good reviews, and relatively affordable. And so, I bought the HP Envy 15-ep1000. The issue is, I was constantly getting blue screen hangs that seemed to be related to graphics (though there was no single cause of this issue) and after many calls to tech support, 3 reinstalls of the OS, and sending it in for repair , HP said that everything is fine.  Well, its still not fine, and there's seemingly nothing to resolve the issue, so HP has agreed to give me a full refund. For clarity, I would get different blue screen errors while doing relatively simple tasks in ArcGIS Pro and AutoCAD 3D Map. \n\nI'm now back at square one where I need to find a solid workstation, in short order.  For context, **the most intensive programs I need to run are AutoCAD, ArcGIS Pro, AutoDesk Revit, SketchUp, the Adobe Creative Suite, and Lumion.** I require discreet graphics, 16GB of ram at the bare minimum, a solid design (metal ideally) - and it sure would be handy to have some USB A and HDMI ports, though not imperative. \n\nI'm basically wondering if I should just get another HP Envy 15 (since it was everything I needed at a great price - *the seemingly perfect PC for me, if you will*) or look for something else.\n\nI've been looking at the new **Dell XPS 15s with the gen. 12 Intel CPU** \\- not ideal for ports or price but they seem to be well built and popular. My other idea is another HP like an HP Z Book but they are much more expensive for less specs than the Envy - or perhaps a Dell Precision. I need the discreet graphics and would really like 32GB of Ram and at least 1/2 TB of SSD storage (ideally more), and a nice metal finished design. Display and sound aren't all that important to me. My budget is $3000 Canadian (\\~USD $2,500). \n\nPlease advise me on what you think my next best move is. I'm not a very techy PC person, but I do need to have a solid workstation for the field I'm in.",
  "I would go with Dell xps 15  or maybe xps 17",
  "HP had issues with weak hinges .\nxps 17 is more expensive than the 15  but beside the bigger screen you will get a way better cooling system (vapor chamber)",
  "Sounds like you got a faulty unit. If you are set on the HP then give it another shot cause the issues you where having are not \"normal\". I personally like Dell but that's  subjective, in any case constant blue screens shouldn't  be common on either model.",
  ">they seem to be well built and popular\n\nDell XPS series *were* popular and well built, emphasis on \"were\".\n\n>Display and sound aren't all that important to me\n\nThis makes your choice really simple. You only have to consider 2 things: How much battery life and GPU power you need. For example, are you good with 2 hour browsing time and RTX 3050, or do you need 10 hour browsing time and RTX 3080?",
  "Why so?",
  "Was the weak hinges only with the x360 version of Envy (the one that is a 2-in-1) or was it with the normal clamshell Envy as well?",
  "That latter? Which direction does that point me in?",
  "Clamshell Envy , over all HP has bad reputation in hinges and I didn't know till I had the issue with my laptop . Can't confirm.that every HP laptop has the issue lately.",
  "Asus laptops - Zephyrus G15, Zephyrus Duo 16, Strix G15, and Flow X16 - have 7-8 hours.\n\nDell XPS 17 and HP Envy 16 get 5 hours at best. If you're good with that battery life, they are both decent choices for sure.",

  "The 2020 King of Portable 2 in 1s: LG Gram 2 in 1 14 inch **EDIT 4 5 MONTHS LATER:** [New Lenovo Carbon Yoga leaked on it's way, might be just enough to compete with the Spin 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lenovo/comments/hh0xzf/in_the_blink_of_an_eye_it_seems_the_almost/)\n\nEDIT 3: Found the mystery, it's the [Acer Spin 5 13.5](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Acer-Spin-3-and-Spin-5-are-now-slimmer-and-get-a-much-needed-upgrade-to-Intel-Ice-Lake.449311.0.html) inch which comes with 3:2 aspect ratio, not the LG Gram. It's not as a wide as the 14 Gram/c940, but it's about as equal in dimensions as the Surface Book 2 (taller than 16:9 14 inch laptops). For this reason + the almost exact same specs as the Gram, it would make it as a solid contender for the real king of 2020 2 in 1 portables.\n\nSmall note: Lenovo's c940 14 inch recieved a BIOS update which now gives about full 10 hour battery life(4K version, UHD probably gets a lot more), ALSO NOW coming close for that 2020 crown. At this point, it's all up to your tastes to which really deserves it.\n\nOriginal post:EDIT 2: So it seems that the aspect ratio of 3:2 in the Gram 2 in 1 was misinformation from a video, as it's apparently a 16:9 ratio instead. I'd still say this 2 in 1 is one of the best since it actually provides a bigger battery with a lot less weight than normal 14 inch models\n\nOriginal post:\n\nAfter a few companies have tried to make the perfect portable 2 in 1 convertible, LG actually went and finally pulled it off among it's competition with it's new Gram 2 in 1 14 inch announced at CES 2020.\n\nMain strong points:\n\nBigger and better battery life, which promises the highest battery life up to date for a 14 inch (not sure how much it was exactly, but I think it was about \\~70,000 mWh sized)\n\nOnly 2 in 1 to weight around 2.5 lb with that big of a battery and screen, making it's tablet mode really easy to use with maximum weight portability in mind\n\nGreat port selection up to HDMI and \\*Thunderbolt 3 (need confirmation there tho since previous Gram 2 in 1 did not have it, reviewer at CES said it might have it)\n\nAnd lastly, Intel's 10th gen chip with 11th gen Iris Plus Graphics for light gaming\n\nAs of now, only the Lenovo c940 could compete against this in the 14 inch category, but with relatively poor battery life and 0.5 pounds extra, the Gram seems to take the cake here. Honorable mentions I'd put the HP Spectre 13 inch late 2019 refresh (16:9 aspect ratio on a 13.3 inch screen tho, horrible design imo) and the new Samsung Galaxy Book Flex (which is like the XPS 13 2 in 1 but arguably better with some extra features with a 16:10 aspect ratio on 13.3 inch).\n\nMy only worries for the LG Gram 2 in 1 2020 so far: chassis hopefully is as sturdy as the c940 (or close to it since c940 has an excellent chassis durability), speaker system will probably not be as good obviously (c940 has Dolby Atmos 360 hinge, hopefully LG's sound will be not completely bad) and Thunderbolt 3's inclusion. Other than those worries, seems to be on it's way to being the 2020 king of portable 2 in 1's.\n\nNote: Did not consider any 2 in 1 15 inches and above since all have weights more than 4 lb and big form factor (while I would say the new HP Spectre x360 15 2020 is the best new coming relatively portable 15 inch 2 in 1, but weighing at 4 lb with a big chassis not many bags can fit, it would basically come at 2nd best portable 2 in 1 for 2020, in case you're looking in the 15 category. If gaming is your thing in the 2 in 1 category then this new HP will probably best fit your needs).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Small but important note: also worried the Gram might not have Windows Hello IR facial recognition, as that I believe is fundamental for any 2 in 1 to have while utilizing in tablet or tent mode. Hopefully it comes with IR additionally to it's finger print Windows Hello scanner to get the real title of (at least almost) perfect 2 in 1 ultraportable.",

  "Valid point, but I'm lead to believe all 2 in 1's suffer from this. As an owner of a Lenovo Yoga c940 UHD 14' and past owner of a 2017 HP Spectre x360 13', can confirm both units had/have issues with thermals and sometimes fans spun up while even being at idle. Thankfully I discovered undervolting which quickly fixed that issue pretty fast, as fans (which were always an issue on c940's) barely turn on anymore with idle temps of 39-44 degrees. Before it would almost be at 54-60 on idle occasionally with Windows doing background processes, but undervolting did the trick just right.",

Only reason why I excluded them from my analysis is due to body weight (4lb is honestly a bit too much for a 2 in 1) and screen size makes chassis far too big to carry around conventionally in backpacks for most people.",
  "Haha wow. Any reason specifically you didn't like all the ones you returned? What feature do you find them missing so much to not upgrade your c920?",
  "Hi u/teamblades44, what kind of USB-C charger do you use for something with such a big battery (I mean, can any USB-C charger charge as fast as the proprietary power brick?)",
  "Why do you think 4 pounds is too much? My 14 inch laptop is 4 pounds and I wouldn't say it's heavy",
  "You can use any 65 or 90 W USB-c charger.  I think it charges a tiny bit slower but even when I'm using it it still is charging it rather than discharging.",
  "I classify 4 pounds to be a bit on the heavy side for 2 main reasons (one mostly personal other a bit more objective)\n\n1. I carry my laptop in an over the shoulder backpack with a bit of cables and charging equipment. I used to always carry with me a 1.3 pound battery in that bag alongside my old Surface Pro 5, which gave it a bit of weight to the bag but manageable. With the 3 pounds from my c940 and 1.3 from the battery, I do feel shoulder pain when getting home most of the time, so I opted for carrying it my main backpack separately.\n2. My c940 14 inch at 3 pounds is juuust the borderline of what I would consider ideal weight for a 2 in 1. Using it in tablet mode is roughly hard due to weight + sharp edges which stab a bit into the hands, tho I do find 3 pounds to be good enough that the laptop can be held with one hand a bit relatively easy. But at 4 pounds, I wouldn't see myself ever using it in tablet mode and one hand usage would be on the bare minimum there. This is where the new Gram stands out with a killer 3:2 aspect ratio perfect for tablet mode plus an ideal 2.5 weight\n\nWhile I get this might be more personal since it's 1 pound difference from the c940, I know people like to carry light when on the go, and a 15 inch laptop for me is a bit too much for super portability too. Mostly this is just personal tastes, but a 3:2 aspect ratio with 14 inch wideness honestly would be more than good of a display for any needs I would say imo. It all comes down to personal tastes.",
  "If you use it in tablet mode, the weight doesn't matter...\n\nLike it could weight 10 pounds but that won't really affect how you use it as a tablet\n\nBut for day to day carry, I could totally understand wanting something lighter",
  "It actually does matter quite a bit haha, try holding the tablet in the air as you would an iPad to read and your arms will get tired pretty darn quick. Most reviewers always mention this for 2 in 1's since weight is what normally restricts tablet mode for most of them, except this here Gram which finally fixed the issue in a lot of senses.",
  "You don't hold it in your hands. You place it flat on a table like a tablet or drafting table",
  "As someone who suffers from constant neck pains from looking down too much while studying, holding the tablet in the air both in desk and in bed is a godsend feature for me. Really the only think I'll miss from my Surface Pro 5 tbh, since that only weighs a mere 1.7 pounds. I know other people in my school do this hence why I decided to mention it.",
  "I need a laptop to learn to code on and to use after I’ve learnt, starting with python and then c++ I’m looking for something to get me started but to last a while after as I’m looking to get a pc next year when I’ve saved enough money.   I want to spend under £500 ideally, I’ve been recommended two different laptops but am unsure which is better.  \n\nASUS VivoBook F515JA 15.6” Laptop - Intel® Core™ i5, 256 GB SSD, Grey  \n\n&  \n\nASUS VivoBook F515EA 15.6” Laptop - Intel® Core™ i3, 256 GB SSD, Grey  \n\nI think the main difference is the processor the first has an i5 10th gen and the second an i3 11th gen both are close in price but I’m clueless about laptop parts and performance.  What would be best out of these two for coding? Or what others can you recommend?   \n\nI was recommended the i3 one by curry’s but am unsure if the i5 is better as I’ve seen good reviews of it but no comparison!\n\nPlease let me know if you need any more info!\n\nThank you in advance!",
  "overall i5 are better, overall. you also don’t require a lot of cpu or resources just for coding simple stuff.\nget an i5 with 8 tb ram and an ssd.there are a lot of good thinkpads used that cost 100 or 200$",
  "Thank you very much both of these were around the £450 mark hopefully I can save some money on a cheaper one",
  "search here on reddit, you will find good used and cheap thinkpads or something else",
  "Another thing I’m reading is important is the screen size to be 15-16” is this really important? I really don’t want to get something that’s not going to do the job as I’m kinda solely buying it for coding so really don’t want to spend too much",
  "It sounds like I'm being snarky, but it kind of depends on how good your eyes are. For coding you want decent resolution because you will often have multiple windows open at once. I didn’t look up those laptops, but try to get full HD (1920x1080). If you found a 14\" laptop with full HD you probably won't really notice the difference between 14\" and 15\". However the keyboard may be more cramped, the touchpad may be smaller, and you might have less battery life. It will probably be lighter and less expensive.",
  "if you’re going to spend a long time coding, yes, a good screen will do wonders.",
  "what length of m.2 ssd can be added to this laptop? ",
  "Need help choosing a budget friendly laptop as a college student.  \n\nHello all! I've been saving for a laptop for awhile now since the one I currently have is a NIGHTMARE. I wanna pay for this with my own money as I've relyed on my dad paying too much for too long in my life. My laptop crashed in the middle of an exam today and I'm fed up having to beg professors that I'm not lying it really is my laptop.\n\n1. My budget is $400-500. I wish I had more but I'm a poor college student...\n2. I'd be using it for daily assignments such as microsoft word, excel, powerpoint and usually for about a hour a night I enjoy a little bit of roblox and I want to get into Fortnite on a laptop but its not too important I'm more concerned about my Netflix, assignments, and roblox.I like the 15.6 laptops and I currently have a 14 inch HP I got on blackfriday for about $149. It was as slow as ever as soon as I opened it out of the box because I figured I don't need a laptop for more than microsoft word but this one cant even do that. I'd like it to be a little light as it will be in my backpack most of the day walking around my university.\n3. Country is USA\n4. I prefer windows as I've had MacBooks in the past and they don't work for me.\n\nI was looking at this laptop on amazon and saw a youtube review on it that suggested I could add 4 GB of ram and some storage too it for about $90 (which I know nothing about so if you guys could recommend how to buy that I'd also be grateful). This is the laptop I was looking at if that helps.

  "Your best value proposition is a second hand ThinkPad. Look on eBay or even Reddit /r/thinkpadsforsale   for a T460 or T470. You might also be able to find a new or refurbished E590 or E595.",
  "I'd recommend this, it's currently on sale. Buy open box https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-envy-x360-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-256gb-solid-state-drive-natural-silver-sandblasted-anodized-finish/6338813.p?skuId=6338813",
  "E480 base, extremely cheap and only 1 generation old",
  "A lot of folks I know have had bad luck with Acer.",
  "If you get an intel processor, make sure its at least 8th gen because the generations before 8th gen had 2 cores. Everything after 8th gen i5/i7 has 4+ cores which is pretty big difference. Also try and look for a laptop that has an ssd. Good luck!",
  "Any i5 8300H laptop you like.. I have a Lenovo Legion with i5 8300H processor... use Archicad and Solidworks and I love the speed.. i7 8750H was my initial choice until I realized from reviewd it is just an expensive water boiling processor not made for laptops and not much faster than i5 8300H as long as thermal throttle doesn't activate...",
  "I can vouch for this option. Went back to uni about 2 years ago and got myself a used/refurbished thinkpad and it's been ideal for classes.",
  "Yes, I raccomend this option too and save some money (from you budget) to looking for a new battery (a new battery could helps you to reach 5-9hrs with those thinkpads).",
  "I see one on eBay refurbished for only $330 so I’m gonna do some research !",
  "I can stand by this recommendation. I bought a Thinkpad T420 on eBay for $100 2.5 years ago. Post said it had a bad screen and it didn't come with a hard drive so I also bought a spare screen for pretty cheap (don't remember exact price) and a 256gig SSD. I added 8gig of RAM and a bought a new battery. All told I was into everything for about $250. It was pretty powerful, had a wonderful keyboard, and decent battery life. The screen was hot garbage and the trackoad was terrible but the trackpoint system works super well and you can upgrade the screens without too much work. That was probably the best computer purchase I have ever made in terms of bang for the buck.",
  "It says it’s out of stock on open box when you add to cart 😅😫",
  "If you do go with a ThinkPad, please look at the Lenovo ThinkPad forum for that specific model for support and also r/thinkpads",
  "Look for ones which are compatible with the secondary battery which can give u all day battery in some cases like the t470 or t480"
