  "Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 vs HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 vs Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Gen 10 Aura Edition Hi everyone!  \nI’ve been researching 2-in-1 laptops for months because I want to buy one during Black Friday and honestly, it’s been *hard*. I don’t know much about PCs or specs, so I’m hoping some of you can lend me a hand!  \n(I would love to be able to use it in uni, to keep it for a solid 5-6 years, to be able to use krita for drawing/ light animations and to do a little light gaming like vanilla minecraft and stardew valley)\n\nAfter a lot of digging, I narrowed it down to three main contenders:\n\n* **Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360**\n   * **Pros:** part of the Samsung ecosystem, anti-glare display, comes with the S Pen, great battery life.\n   * **Cons:** only 16 GB of RAM available, 16″ feels a bit too big, and I’ve seen a few mentions of screen cracking? I couldn’t find many detailed reviews: almost no one seems to be talking about it, and the few reviews out there only cover the 32 GB model (which isn’t even available)\n* **HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14**\n   * **Pros:** 32 GB RAM option, battery life, very sleek design.\n   * **Cons:** keyboard doesn’t seem great, and the audio quality apparently isn’t that good, pen not always included\n* **Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Gen 10 Aura Edition**\n   * **Pros:** keyboard, build quality, OLED screen, 32 GB RAM, pen included\n   * **Cons:** battery life might not be as strong as the other two, and the display seems quite reflective with little to no anti-glare coating.\n\nIf anyone has real-world experience with any of these, or recommendations for better alternatives in the same range, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",
  "Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 G10 Aura Edition Review with new 1600-nit tandem OLED ",
  "Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition vs HP Omnibook Flip Ultra 14 Hi all, I had the opportunity to try the Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition alongside the HP Omnibook Flip Ultra 14, both with the same configuration (32GB RAM and the same processor). Many people have asked me about the differences, so I decided to share my impressions! 😊\n\nFirst:  \nSorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language. 😊\n\nThe HP is a beautiful device and smaller than the Lenovo. It also has a sturdier display and a nice design. But it is just personal preferable. However, the Lenovo has better battery life (it lasts me all day if I’m not gaming - really great). In stress tests, both performed similarly, but Lenovo was slightly better. I think Lenovo has nicer colors, and the quick side buttons for performance adjustments became an instant favorite for me.\n\nLenovo has an excellent keyboard, which I prefer over HP’s (though some might find the extra side keys bothersome, I personally find them great). Typing on the Lenovo keyboard feels comfortable. Both have the same keyboard backlighting, but Lenovo’s felt better to me. The stylus is good on both, but the Lenovo stylus feels better in my hand. Writing and drawing on the screen feel the same, though palm rejection on the Lenovo seems slightly better.\n\nGaming:\n\nNeither laptop is designed for gaming, but they can handle lighter games like The Sims without major issues. I believe the HP Omnibook had slightly better FPS, but the difference was minimal.\n\nNoise Levels:\n\nBoth laptops can be quiet. The Lenovo makes absolutely no noise during regular use. Even when playing simple games on balanced or lower performance modes, it remains silent. In contrast, the HP Omnibook always had a faint hissing sound, which slightly bothered me. The cooling system would frequently activate.\n\nHowever, at high performance levels, the HP Omnibook was quieter and more bearable than the Lenovo Yoga. Under heavy load, Lenovo’s fans engage more aggressively and are quite audible. Gaming on high performance mode sounds like a mild vacuum cleaner—similar to a gaming laptop. So, for demanding tasks and intense applications, HP wins in terms of noise control. On the other hand, Lenovo is completely silent during standard usage, whereas HP is slightly audible. HP does ramp up its fans under high performance too, but its noise level is lower or at least more tolerable compared to Lenovo.\n\nTemperature:\n\nAt idle, my Lenovo was around 26-32°C, while the HP was roughly 25-31°C. During standard tasks like watching videos or using Copilot, both reached similar temperatures of 35-45°C, depending on workload. Gaming temperatures reached around 50°C. Overall, HP was about one degree cooler. But under high performance mode, I feel Lenovo cooled slightly faster and better (though the fan noise was noticeable more on lenovo than HP), but the difference was minimal.\n\nSoftware:\n\nBoth come with several pre-installed apps. However, Lenovo Yoga includes two free premium programs (one for drawing and another for notes), while HP does not. Both have decent applications for managing updates and performance settings.\n\nSummary:\n\nBoth laptops feel high-quality and have a beautiful design. They are very similar in performance with identical configurations. Speed is comparable, and they both handled stress tests well (Lenovo performed slightly better, maybe likely due to stronger cooling). Overall, both are solid choices. Lenovo stands out with a better keyboard, fast side keys for performance adjustments (which might not appeal to everyone), two free creative apps, and complete silence during standard use. HP, on the other hand, offers Gorilla Glass, a sleek design, a more compact build, and quieter operation at high performance levels, though its fans are slightly audible even during regular tasks.  \n  \nI decided to keep the Lenovo Yoga. For me it feels better.\n\nLenovo Yoga has undergone military durability tests, but HP felt slightly more solid to me (though this is just my impression). Both are excellent laptops, but Lenovo Yoga seemed to offer more for the price.\n\nPlease note that this is a personal review, not a professional one. Everyone has different preferences, and my assessment is based on using both laptops simultaneously. However, it is difficult to judge them fully, as I only had about a day to test them both on the same time.",
  "Ironically I'm in this dilemma right now. After several days of researching every type of laptops, looking over features, specs, etc. I've narrowed by choice between both laptops (same configurations). I'm torn on which computer to buy. Here are my current Pros & Cons of each that have left me undecided from a consumer perspective.

The sleek design and lightweight construction of the laptop are also well-received, making it a portable and stylish choice for users.\n\n.... Leaning toward purchasing the Omnibook, unless someone yells \"NOOOOO!!! you're making a huge mistake!!\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* Quick Update: Just realized i'm comparing a different Lenova product to the Omnibook. I'm comparing is different than OP, i'm comparing the Lenovo - Yoga 9i 2-in-1 14\" 4K OLED Touchscreen Laptop with Pen to the HP - OmniBook Ultra Flip 2-in-1 - Copilot+ PC\n\n||\n||\n|[https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-yoga-9i-2-in-1-14-4k-oled-touchscreen-laptop-with-pen-intel-core-ultra-7-155h-with-32gb-memory-1tb-ssd-cosmic-blue/6571372.p?skuId=6571372](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-yoga-9i-2-in-1-14-4k-oled-touchscreen-laptop-with-pen-intel-core-ultra-7-155h-with-32gb-memory-1tb-ssd-cosmic-blue/6571372.p?skuId=6571372)|\n\n[https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-omnibook-ultra-flip-2-in-1-copilot-pc-14-3k-oled-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-9-32g-memory-2tb-ssd-eclipse-gray/6601706.p?skuId=6601706](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-omnibook-ultra-flip-2-in-1-copilot-pc-14-3k-oled-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-9-32g-memory-2tb-ssd-eclipse-gray/6601706.p?skuId=6601706)",
  "Did you notice any difference between the screens, specifically with respect to brightness and glare? I am considering both of these models and I would like to know if either one would have better visibility outdoors.",
  "hello there, thanks for this. I'm currently deciding between these two. May I know if you have the 2025 gen 10 for the Yoga? Do you see any screen door effect on the Yoga? I currently have the Omnibook Ultra Flip 14, got it at a really nice price but the screendoor effect on the OLED display is killing the deal for me. I'm wondering if the Yoga also has the same issue?\n\nI was trying out a Yoga 7 Slim (with touchscreen), it doesnt have such issue.\n\n  \nThanks a lot!",
  "They both are Copilot plus PC :), this it the same",
  "What did you end up buying?",
  "I also was eyeing these computers.  I had a look at two different best buys on two separate days.  My first instinct was the HP omnibook had a nice build and hardware for the price.  The Lenovo caught my eye but was more than I wanted to spend so I didn't really pursue it much.  Upon returning to the store after watching some reviews online I went back to the Omni book pulled up YouTube on the highest resolution and was very underwhelmed by the video quality and screen refresh rate.  I also was not a fan of the low travel keyboard on the omnibook.  I returned to the Lenovo and saw it discounted to $1349.  I also considered the ZenBook s 14 but they did not have this on display and it was so close in price I went with the Lenovo.  After unboxing and set up I'm very happy to say I made the right decision.  OLED 120hz 3k screen with 32g RAM and Intel ultra 7 hit all my boxes and hope to keep this computer for many years.",
  "The Yoga has a brighter panel, but it seems to have no anti-reflective treatment whatsoever, so in practicality glare may be worse",
  "Hi, is the screendoor effect so bad on the Ultra Flip 14?",
  "I noticed this in the specs, but thought the HP was integrated with advanced AI features while the other had basic AI",
  "I ended up going with the Lenovo Yoga. Although I dont have the HP to compare, I really like this laptop. Haven't had any issues yet (knock on wood).",
  "Update?",
  "Hey, how's your experience so far with it?",
  "After a 2nd review, I realized both laptops have AI co-pilot, the Omni Co-Pilot just offers a slightly more advanced version. Also, although the Lenovo has 1TB less of SDD, there's room to add additional space for much less than the cost difference between both computers. \n\n\nAfter second review, I decided to buy the Yoga as the key selling points of Price, stylist (pen), & resolution far exceeded that of the Omni.",
  "I was skeptical bc I always hated Lenovo computers. Most of my previous employers CPUs were Lenovo. Took a gamble bc of the additional features & glad I did. Absolutely love the Pilot AI too. It's fast, came w/ a stylist, the dark blue out cover was sleek and no tacky. Has enough space to store anything, hasn't froze up at all & I can have several different tabs open and the computer still operates as it should. I've only owned it for a few months now, but, so far so good.",

  "I've had a Lenovo Yoga in past I wasn't too impressed, the ProArt can have 8Tb ssd",
  "if not in a hurry i think you can try for lunar lake with a nvidia gpu otherwise go with **Asus ProArt P16**",
  "Yoga seems like the better value. You get the same performance essentially, a brighter faster refreshing display (but give up 10% or so adobe RGB coverage), and you trade a little battery performance for a price difference that could buy you your own Asus proart 4k monitor if you wanted and still have some cash to spare.",
  "Well, i got myself a Asus ProArt P16.  Its about one month i my hands. Pretty happy with it, build quality is very good, screen is awesome, came with 64GB ram and 2TB drive.  Touchpad is nowhere near haptic touch pads in macbooks, but its very good compared to others i have tried. In short it is as good as it gets for not haptic touch pad.   When video editing battery from 80-10% lasts about 1,5-2,5h depending on workload. When doing everyday stuff it does not seem to drop at all.   Its a shame with modern laptops that they dont have S3 sleep option. Its so called “always connected”.  When sleeping device in 15-17h consumes about 15% of battery… i have a phone in my pocket that is always connected, i dont need laptop for that! Anyway… Charger is quite big, but it is charging from a 90w thru USBC pretty good if needed. But while editing battery drains slowly with 90w connected. Screen, as everyone said in reviews, is wobbly, so is on other laptops. I havent experienced any discomfort while on it is on table. Haven't had a chance to use it an my lap, or train yet. Over all i would say i made a good purchase, at least at the moment i think so. 😁",
  "Am also stuck between the 2.\n\nHave you chosen one? If so, which one and why?",
  "good on you man, appreciate this and the work you put in",
  "Thanks, will keep in mind.\n\nI was thinking about that also, but as i understand higher spec lunar lake laptops ar at least 2 months away. Currently for preorder are only with integrated graphics.",

  "Well, Lenovo was unavailabale and had older CPU at the time. \nI got P16, very happy. Works nice for video editing, screen is amazing, battery life while editing is around 2h+ if charged to 100%, a bit warm above keyboard when under heavy load, touch pad is as close as it gets to what macbook has.\nOver all very good pirchase. Got it in september, still no regrets. ",
  "Same here, did you already choose one?",
  "Yeah from what I've seen it will get worse battery performance, but the p16 isnt exactly like a \"just leave your charger at home\" type laptop either. Both can be stretched to get decent light web browsing and video type performance but if you're wanting to do anything intensive like photo or video editing, you're not going to last a work day. I'm curious if you find an upgraded 99wh battery for the Lenovo since the battery is replaceable.",
  "No, havent tried it yet, will definatelly try. Thanks",
  "Thanks OP",
  "Hey, yeah, I went with the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9.  \nI intended to use it for some casual video editing and music productions because the specs seemed good enough for it, turns out life is so busy and I am just unmotivated to make time for it. T'is now lightly put to work for simple web browsing and mostly YouTube viewing.\n\nHowever, I don't ever see myself buying another laptop or pc in the future, I play console if I ever game. And for what it is, it really is a decent laptop in terms of on paper specs and I can see it being put to work for what it is built for and being good at it. But, I'm no laptop expert and I'm sure there are better laptops out there for just as much or whatever.  \n  \nHaving owned it for just a little over 2 months, I have nothing to complain about. Fan is quiet, I get at least half a day of battery with the light use I do now, its almost always hooked up with the charger. The screen is a bit glassy and could be a bit brighter during the day. It is good for how I use it now and if I ever do use it with my original intentions I am pretty sure it wouldn't have a problem doing it.\n\nThat is my take on this machine.",
  "Its just so annoying that no windows machine can beat a macbook pro... but i just hate MacOS. \n\nand the lenovo was the closest i found in build quality",

  "Yeah after exhaustive research, I've found there's no perfect device. MacBooks seem nice but they have their flaws too and you pay way too much for them. You pick your flaws. Personally I'm leaning towards a laptop and tablet combo. If you need just something ultra portable with loads of battery for light tasks, why not just snag a tablet? Plus you could rig it as a second display for your laptop. I'm wanting to do this anyways because I think I'd like having a writing tablet for note taking and white boarding programming projects while in meetings. Then if I want to catch up on personal emails during lunch or review notes of new stuff I'm learning, I can leave the laptop at my desk. If I know I'm going to a coffee shop to go do some more serious work, I can always take a GaN charger which should be plenty Photoshop and davinci. \n\nI'm considering something like a Lenovo tab plus or something.

  "Help Choosing Between A Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i and Dell XPS 16 ",
  "Hello all! \n\n  \nWould love to get some input between these two laptops. I've been hearing great things about the new Lenovo Yoga 9i, but know Dell's XPS lineup has a good reputation. Both would be purchased at similar prices (2nd hand), I just used the bestbuy links as they offered the most information and match the models exactly. \n\n  \nI have gone though many laptops before and impartial to either in this case. Would love to hear what you have to say! \n\n  \nThank you!",

  "First impressions of the 2023 Lenovo Slim (Yoga) Pro 9i I just bought on clearance I finally pulled the trigger on a new laptop. I was waiting for the new 16 inch Yoga Pro 9i to go on sale at Best Buy when I found last year's 16 inch Slim Pro 9i on clearance for $1,099 at a Costco about an hour from my house. Even though it lacks some of the refinements of the newer model, I couldn't pass up that price. It is the mini-LED touch screen version with intel i9 processor, GeForce RTX 4050 GPU, 32GB RAM, and 1TB SSD. I will mostly be using it for productivity, music production, some video editing, and watching stuff on YouTube.\n\nI set it up last night and did all the system updates. Here are my first impressions\n\n**Looks/build/feel/ports:**\n\n* Build quality feels insanely good to me - the Storm Gray aluminum body is super sleek. \n* The keyboard is incredible (one of the things I liked about the new model when I tried it at Best Buy) \n* The glass trackpad also feels amazing and has a fairly satisfying click (I prefer this to haptic personally).\n* A little heavy, but also seems slimmer and more compact than I was expecting.\n\n**Screen:**\n\nI wasn't sure how I'd feel about the screen, as I've never owned a glossy one before, but wow. It is spacious and bright and very impressive. Unfortunately, the HDR mode in Windows seems to do something wacky with the colors, but in SDR, it still seems to have plenty of contrast to me. I put it side by side with my partners MacBook Pro and it was definitely brighter, although the overall colors on the Mac are still better IMO. I haven't really noticed any of the blooming people complain about. Ghosting has also not been an issue.\n\n**Speakers:**\n\nAs good as everyone says. Comparable to Mac.\n\n**Performance:**\n\nThis computer is fast and fluid, even at 60hz refresh. It is very quiet and cool when not in performance mode. I haven't really put it to the test yet, but I'm thinking it should be able to handle whatever I throw at it.\n\n**Battery:**\n\nThis is the main thing reviewers complain about with this model (and to a lesser extent the newer model). I was expecting the worst, but so far I'm pretty impressed. I've been using it off and on today for the last 6 hours for some work and web browsing, and I'm now sitting at about 25%. This is with battery saver on, so I'd expect worse in intelligent cooling mode, and much worse in performance mode.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSo far, I'm pretty much loving this thing. Most of the issues I've had have been related to OneDrive syncing things I didn't ask it to and other Windows-related complaints. The other issue is ports - it has a decent selection, but I'm hoping I can find a USBC charger that will work with it (this has been another complaint in previous reviews).\n\nOf course, the newer model just went on sale at Best Buy for $1,499. That has the \"Ultra\" i9 processor and a slightly bigger battery, as well as fixing some of the port issues. But at that price it comes with the IPS, albeit a very nice one, and it's still $400 more than what I paid.  They have the mini-LED variant with RTX 4060 on sale for $1649 as well.\n\nPart of my plan was that if I wanted, I could just return this one to Costco and go grab the newer model, but I really like getting a good bang for my buck and I think I've achieved that with the older model. However, I'd say if you are considering the new Yoga Pro 9i, both options are a great value at the current sale price.\n\nSidenote: the other great value option I was considering was the IdeaPad Pro 5i at Costco for $1,499 with similar specs, but with an OLED. However, I wasn't impressed with the low-resolution of the screen in person and the build just didn't seem as good to me. ",

  "If you haven't yet you need to download the hdr calibration tool from the windows store and manually calibrate the screen. I thought I was watching things in hdr but realized it wasn't calibrated at all and was basically the same as sdr.

  "I bought this laptop too around half a year ago, also mostly because of the pretty decent discount.

  "I used it for a while and also really liked it. Longer battery life, more gaming-capable, lighter, more ports and better located, per-key RGB backlighting, etc. \n\nBut the screen (while still very good) didn't pop as much with the colors, the keyboard was mushier, the speakers/webcam/microphone weren't as high quality, and the build quality was a slight step down as I could feel some creaks holding it one-handed. With the Slim Pro 9 I really only feel the creaks if I apply pressure on the bottom cover. And I grew to really like the size of the Slim Pro 9's touchpad.",
  "No, it's for the 16\" variant.",

  "Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16\" 2023 Personal Review Hi guys, I have used this laptop over one month, therefore want to share some thoughts here (and gain some karma:)). I'm definitely not trying to sell it to you, so I'll talk about its pros and cons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrice: I paid AU$2723 - AU$437.28(cashback) = AU$2285.72 (= US$1553.72)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpec:\n\nProcessor : 13th Generation Intel® Core™ i9-13905H Processor (E-cores up to 4.10 GHz P-cores up to 5.40 GHz)\n\nGraphic Card : NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4050 Laptop GPU 6GB GDDR6\n\nMemory : 32 GB LPDDR5X-6400MHz (Soldered)\n\nStorage : 1 TB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 TLC\n\nDisplay : 16.0\" 3.2K (3200 x 2000), IPS, Glare, Non-Touch, 100%DCI-P3, 400 nits, 165Hz, Glass\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I opened the box, I was very impressed, it looks as an artwork. I have used Macbook for few years, I think this build quality is even better than MBP, at least similar.\n\nThat night, I used it to play some youtube videos and music, the sound is good, the screen is superb.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iusuog3elheb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d60e58281ed2c9144f0dadfeec50f7d67081c383\n\nAll right, that's all about the feel and look.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding to its performance:\n\n1. i9-13905H. According to my research, this is a custom CPU upon 13900 with more power and less space.\n2. 32GB/1TB, notihng special. DDR5 is good, but soldered approach is not extensible. By the way, it can add one more 2280 SSD storage.\n3. RTX4050, well, due to lots of research, I found 4050's performance is similar to 3060. Which is definitely the situation of 3050. If you buy 4060, it will have \\~20% improvement, but at the time of purchaing, it will cost me AUD 300 more, therefore I didn't choose it. When I get it, I played Forza Horizon 5, in 2k solution, I can run it with the second highest setting (forgot the name) and it was very smooth. But I'm not a fan of playing game, so just played 3 days, then never touch it again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion\n\nPros:\n\n1. Screen display is amazing.\n2. Very powerful machine, I'm a programmer, I can feel the difference when using docker or starting a heavy application.\n3. It has around 130w power supply in total for CPU and GPU, which unleash the power of both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCons (actually that's the valuable part, you can't get it from elsewhere):\n\n1. This is a full sized keyboard, with numpad. I don't like it, I have another 14\" thinkpad, every key is larger than the 16\" full sized one. I prefer the larger keycap, and I doubt numpad is useful for most people.\n2. Heavy? Yes, but not too heavy, you can get the exact weight from Internet, this is a 16\" laptop, the weight is lighter is most similar sized laptops. If you are a student, want to take it to lab or classroom, maybe you should avoid this one, and choose a 14\" laptop.\n3. It comes with a 170w power supply, um... I don't like it. If you buy Yoga pro 9i 14\", it comes with a 140w power supply, and its interface is type-c. which gives your laptop 2 type-c and 2 type-a, that would be perfect. But now I only have 2 type-a and 1 type-c, alought it's thunderbolt 4.\n4. RTX4050: the 6gb VRAM will be the bottleneck in the near future. If you like playing game, buy 4060. It will definitely extent your laptop's lifespan.\n5. Warranty, somehow I got only 1 year warranty, so I purchased 2 more years, it also costs me additional $$$. Most other laptops, even lenovo, comes with 3 years warranty by default.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecommendation:\n\nIf you like the powerful spec, I suggest you choose the Yoga Pro 9i 14\" instead of this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask any questions you want to know about this laptop. Also, appreciate so much if you can give me a upvote for my karma growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",
  "Got the same spec as your for $1700. I really like the screen",
  "1 thing to consider is probably the battery life since I've had it for a bit. I lost about 20% in 1 hour of use. FYI it was at 165hz refresh and balanced mode. I was just doing some web browsing. So that's about 5 hours of use which is pretty good for my needs. It's pretty rare to not find an outlet work somewhere or in college which I think this laptop is aimed towards so probably not a huge issue. It's also understandable because it has a mini led 3.2k screen and AN i9 which is POWER HUNGRY for sure, the 4050 also doesn't help. But I feel it's worth it",
  "I have it and it have high pitch fan noises and came with a broken trackpad..",
  "What about battery life?",
  "Hi could you tell me what brand/model the wifi card is?",
  "The real issue with this laptop that nobody mentions - not even Lenovo - is the actual name of the product : Yoga.\n\nAll Yoga laptops are **convertibles,** aka you can flip the screen 360°.\n\nThis one can't, same for the 14'' version, which loose everything that makes it a Yoga a Yoga. You can flip the screen up to 180° which is kind of useless if you ever wanted to use it as a tablet.\n\nIt simply makes it a laptop with a touch-screen instead of a 2-in-1 laptop, and there are better ones out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently i don't even know if any convertible laptops using a Nvidia RTX GPU (and not an integrated graphics one) are available but the Rog Flow X16. Sadly it doesn't feature a numpad or a finterprint scanner.\n\nI guess the perfect gaming 2-in-1 laptop doesn't exist yet !",
  "Thank you for the review, I got the IPS on the way, seems like all the reviews are for the Mini LED version so happy to hear the IPS display is also nice.",
  "How's the battery life like on a casual usage \nbasis?",
  "Can You please tell me from where you bought it that cheaper?",
  "Here is lot of people who not will buy any notebook without numpad. Mostly programmers.",
  "Yep, the screen is amazing, the best 16” screen as of 2023.",
  "how so cheap ? considering getting this same setup",
  "Hey from where you bought it that cheaper in 1700 ?",
  "Now the laptop has been used less than 2 months, so the battery is in new condition.\n\nI took it to deliver a 2 hours session, with balanced mode. After the session, battery dropped to 55%. During the session, at least 1/2 time I was sharing screen, other time I was talking hence screen went to off automatically. \n\nIf you care about battery life, don't buy this laptop. 14\" laptop without discrete GPU would be much better.",

  "THANK YOU. I knew I wasn't misremembering that Yoga was their convertible lineup.",
  "If you have found a 2-in-1 laptop that can do games and has decent battery life, please let me know. I was excited by the HP Spectre x360 but they updated it to force OLED on the dedicated GPU models...",
  "How are you finding it?",
  "Seems like Costco has a holiday deal right now in north America. Same specs for 1499 USD. Get it before it's gone",
  "It was actually supposed to be 2000 but I got a discount from Costco.",
  "Costco. It was on sale for 1599 but with taxes was 1700",
  "I'm looking for something 14-16\" with very good performance, ideally 64 GB ram, dedicated GPU and good battery life, but it's hard to get the best of both worlds (performance and battery life)",
  "I wonder if before you started the presentation you change the settings to use less power, is this not an option ? I would only use full power settings if connected to an outlet",
  "thanks for the reply. i meant the exact model under device manager -> network adaptor. if that's not too much trouble. thanks",
  "Pretty great, build quality is nice. Don't like Lenovo service though, apparently not allowed to open up the device at all since it voids the warranty. When that's up I'll throw in some extra storage in the vacant m.2 slot. I also wish the mini LED display was available in my country, the IPS looks great, but I reckon the other one would look nicer. Also don't like the numpad, keep mistyping due to the offset. Overall pretty favourable but few nitpicks.\n\nThe massive glass trackpad is the best thing about this device.",
  "Yoga Pro 9i 14” fits your requirements",
  "There are 3 modes: saver, balance, performance. (not exactly the name, but doesn't matter)\n\nUsually I use balance mode, If I really need to use the battery for long time, I will switch it to saver mode, otherwise I prefer balance mode e.g. 2 hours session.",
  "No worries, under device manager -> network adaptor is:\n\nIntel(R) Wi-Fi 6E AX211 160MHz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVoting up is helpful to me, thanks",
  "Cool. To be honest it seems like the Mini LED sucks up so much power/battery and is v reflective so the IPS sounds really good to me. How is the battery life for you?",
  "great thanks",
  "Sorry, can't comment on that as I use it plugged in 99% of the time. Also will note the IPS screen is very reflective as well.",

  "Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9 (2024) vs. HP Spectre 14 (2024) - Quick Comparison / Personal Impressions Hi all,\n\ndecided to post a quick review / comparison because I see a lot of people are facing similar buying decision.\n\nI own an Intel 11th generation Yoga 7 Slim 14 inch laptop and am looking for something new. The Yoga 7 is really creaky, has really bad speakers and - main reason I want to switch - only has 60hz. My main monitor and smartphone have 120hz and for me its the biggest innovation in years. I only have a laptop paired with an eGPU (RTX 3060) for desk setup, which works pretty well. I also thought it would be nice to have a 2-in-1 laptop for travelling, long haul flights etc.\n\nTo cut a long story short, after some research I decided on the HP Spectre 14 and the Yoga 9i 2-in-1, both with the latest Intel CPU. I pre-ordered both, so I received each of them with almost no reviews (and therefore no BIAS) out there.\n\nBoth versions had new Intel CPU 155H, 120hz (glossy) OLED screen. The Spectre came with 32GB, the Yoga 2-in-1 with 16GB. I wont talk much about performance because it doesnt really matter for me. There are now benchmarks out to compare.\n\nthe sad news first: I returned both laptop\n\n||HP Spectre 14|Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Design|+/- Personally, I didnt really like the design. Its way better / professional predecessor, but I still dont like the bulkiness and the cut corners of the spectre. Looks somehow awkward for me.|No great design as well. Its somehow looks like an unproportional burger. The top of the laptop is smaller then the bottom, in combination with its rounded and glossy edges it looks very akward. I chose colour \"cosmic blue\" which is okay, but a fingerprint magnet|\n|Build Quality|+ Very nice build quality, solid materials - not creaky at all. Very good hinge.|+ Very good, cant complain. Not creaky at all.|\n|Speakers|+ Very good speakers. Quality reduces drastically if you use in tablet mode, since the speakers actually play in the opposite direction|+ I think the best speakers I ever heard on a laptop, since its basically a huge rotating soundbar. This is great in tablet and tent mode as well, because the sound is still going in your direction|\n|Trackpad|+ Very nice haptic trackpad, definitely the best trackpad I ever used (on track with Macbook Pro)|-/+ Trackpad is only ok. Its not haptic, which is a dissapointment in their flagship|\n|Keyboard|+/- Keyboard was ok, but I don't understand the hype about it. I might be biased because I use Lenovo notebooks at work and home for years.|+ Keyboard is nice. But as said, Im biased / used to use Lenovo keyboards. I didnt like the additional row right to the \"return\" button|\n|Display|- Overall, a very nice OLED screen. But no matter.  The screen was absolutely terrible in terms of the 'screen door effect', I couldnt stand the graininess. I had read before that this could be a problem, but I was sure I could get used to it, but in reality it was an absolute nightmare.                   - Another annoying issue with the screen is that it is barely dimmable. I often use the laptop in bed/dark surroundings to stream something before going to sleep. The lowest dim level is still super bright. You have to use extra software to dim it.|- Nice OLED as well. Drastically less Screen door effect to a level I could live with. Also, its dimmable to very low brightnesss out of the box. Unfortunately the screen is super glossy. I mean, so glossy that in dark enviroment even the backlight of the keyboard is reflected.|\n|Other|- The \"Power On\" button is illuminated constantly, which is very annoying|-|\n\nAs I said, I have returned both laptops. I paid around €1700 for each and each had major faults that did not justify the price for me. The main reasons were the displays, I think glossy is just not for me. While I could live with the Yoga's display, I really missed the haptic touchpad and hated that it only came with 16GB.\n\nThe search continues. I think im done with looking for 2-in-1 and will get a tablet instead. Basically all I need is \"good/very good speakers, haptic t rackpad, non glossy and minimum 90hz screen\".  I have now pre-ordered the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4, which has a matte display and a haptic touchpad, unfortunately it is only 13.5\".  I also assume that the speakers will be bad. Will keep you posted :)\n\nHope it helped!",
  "I'm deciding between these 2. The 2-1 format would be useful for document reading etc, but the glossy screen issue is a deal breaker.   \n  \nCan anyone attest to the effectiveness of a matt screen protector to counter act the reflection?",
  "THANK YOU. Finally, someone who actually addresses the screen door effect in both flagship models. I work in the professional visual industry and need crystal clear displays, or at least with less graininess like e.g. Surfaces. I got both the Yoga 7i and Spectre for comparison and it drove me insane. I'm returning both and ordered the 9i now after reading your review - I found a model with 32GB RAM.\n\nOut of curiosity (and to better justify my money spent...) - Would you surmise you would've kept the Yoga 9i if only it had 32 Gigs of RAM?",
  "Do you know if either laptop supports legacy S3 sleep?",
  "lmfaooo please give an update fast. I was looking to buy either of these and now I don't want to.",
  "I am looking for a similar laptop. Thinkbook 13x is really tempting but 14“ would be even better. A bit outside of the box but the new DELL precision 5490 is on the game for me. 14“ Matte bright IPS touchscreen, nice CPUs, etc. You can choose it without dGPU.\nOr maybe upcoming new HP elitebook x360 if it comes with a H CPU.\nMaybe Huawei Matebook X 2024 is an option, no release date on Europe yet.",
  "u/peyta30 FYI, the 2-in-1 Gen 9 is now available with a Sensel haptic touchpad upgrade in the \"Build Your PC\" tool. Right now it's showing as a $60 upgrade, but once the 2-in-1 goes on sale, that discount will also apply to the haptic touchpad.\n\nFYI, the haptic touchpad in the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4 is not from Sensel.",
  "Hey so I've also been tied between the Lenova Yoga 9i pro and HP Spectre 360 16 inch. Both in 32 GB. The main difference is HP uses a OLED screen but 2800X1800 Res while Lenova Uses LED 3200X2000 Res. The lenovoa looked brighter. The other difference is the HP is 2 in 1 where as the Lenova has the Ultra 9 core processor and HP has the Ultra 7 core processor. So one is newer processor and higher resolution. The other is 2 in 1 and OLED screen oh and the HP has much better speakers. My issue now is that there is another Lenova yoga 9i option which is only $200 more which comes with a Mini LED screen, a higher graphics card 4060X, and 1200 Nit brightNess which is exponentially higher then HP and most other Laptops. The ONLY problem I've seen with that higher Lenova 9i option is that the battery is listed at 5 hours but people have claimed it barely lasts 3 hours. Sigh* If it didn't have the battery issue, I'd get the fully loaded yoga 9i in a heart beat so now I'm still tied between the original 9i or HP Spectre both in 16 inch 32 GB with same graphic card.",
  "Sorry I don't know that!",
  "I'm trying out new Asus g14 and skipping touch screen for now.",
  "Hi! That sounds interesting. On which configurator are you referring? I can't find the option on German or US configurator. Anyways, does that mean that you now provide a 80x135 haptic trackpad? \n\nThanks",
  "fsfs lmk. Touchscreen isnt a dealbreaker for me. Just on the fence rn bec he sale for the Hp spectre ends tmr.",
  "Oops! My mistake.

Choose it cause I wanted an all around laptop that offers good performance while being pretty portable and has a pretty minimal design. Yet, battery is not that great.\nBeen looking for videos on how to optimize it but haven't found anything other than reviews of the laptop. I'm still in the warranty time, I really like it, but looking for ways to optimize it's battery or taking it back and looking for something that has same performance but manages battery life better. So far it gives me 5 hours on a full charge. Turned off some things, lowered the resolution and even have it on battery. Which gave me a bigger expectancy on battery duration while unplugged. Just wanted to see other thoughts or maybe if you have any recommendations on the set up.\nUse:\n-Light gaming, don't care about graphics (have a console for that) but maybe single player games on the xbox gamepass.\n-Solidworks and other CAD systems are also in the picture.\n-I also like movies",

The confusion comes from being unsure if the pro version is worth the extra money, with the 32gb memory and 1Tb storage.

  "Since you're now comparing this to coming from an Apple product, let me explain -   \n\n\nFor laptop PC's, expect 1y-4y because of hardware degradation and WinOS issues later on.   \nMaybe 5y if you really take care of it and reformat the OS when it needs it after years 1.5y-3y.\n\nNot everyone keeps a MacBook for over 4y-5y, either. \n\n16gb on Windows 11 OS is bare minimum for enthusiasts, which means that if you're into design and multitasking, why bother with anything less than 32gb? \n\n8gb RAM on Win10 OS was already barely cutting it for just regular usage. \n\n32gb is for breathing room of other applications that need to remain running in the background, as of Q4-2023. \n\nIf you're spending that much, just get the 32gb RAM and be done with it. \n\nRE: occasionally solidworks  \nThis statement alone already closes the gap of 16gb vs 32gb. \n\nHonestly, you're sacrificing a lot to get a 2-1 computer with a hot burning P-processor on a thin frame, and the lack of upgrade to 64gb RAM. \n\nGet the computer right where it's not sacrificing power, thermals and RAM upgrade capability, ...and just get a regular laptop that's not a 2-1 flatbread laptop.   \nIE - ThinkPad X1 Extreme gen5 is a thin laptop with advanced cooling capability on hot CPU/GPU, and it just blatantly sucks, it's not setup for long term thermals barrier push. \n\nIf you want to take notes that badly onto a tablet, then get a discounted iPad or Galaxy tablet with a pen to see if you're even going to use it or not. People have gotten through engineering courses on notebook paper and heavy laptops, you're not the first to need a tablet computer, but I won't rule it out of the equation if that's your preference for learning in the class and being on the go.\n\nYoga Pro 9i will work with 16gb, but the RAM is not upgradeable, and you'll likely be regretting it later by not jumping to the 32gb, for an few extra bucks.",

  "Narrow down XPS15, MacBook M2/M3, Yoga Pro 9i Hey all! \n\nPlanning on returning to school for data science/stats masters soon, and trying to get ahead with getting a new laptop. My Dell Inspiron 15-7579 I used for undergrad died out on me with a bad battery and eventually mainboard issues, and I'd rather reinvest into a new one than hope to repair it.\n\nI'm looking for a something quick, reliable and ideally lighter than the Insprion (thing was bulky), and trying to compare the specs of each I want to understand which option would be a solid choice for me. Ideally somewhere under $2000, closer to $1500 would be the most willing to spend. Mainly going to use for some programming (Python, R, eventually more languages as I do my own projects), web browsing, watching videos, maybe some light gaming (Baldur's Gate 3 might be the most demanding game in interested in), and overall just to be prepared for future coursework.\n\nI've mainly been a Windows user, but I've heard glowing reviews on the strength and features of the Macbooks M chips it's  made me consider trying them out. Also have a Samsung Galaxy which is why I'm hesistant entering the Apple ecosystem since it wont be fully integrated. \n\n1) Dell XPS 15 Specs:  \n\n13th gen i7-13620H processor, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB Storage, Intel Arc A370M Graphics, FHD+  for $1,499\n\nThis is directly from Dell and I'm able to get 5% back through credit card which saves a tiny bit.

  "Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 10 vs Yoga 9i (14\" intel) Normally I answer these questions for friends and acquaintances but I am a bit stuck right now.\n\nI'm not asking which one is better. Rather, better for my use case.\n\nI need a new laptop. After reviewing many options and I'm down to the **Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 10** vs the **Yoga 9i** and I'm on the fence. The Yoga 7i is the first runner up thanks to the  i7-1255U processor and the Dell XPS 13 was a close second runner up.\n\nBoth with similar specs are around the same price. (16 GB, Display WUXGA touch)\n\nThe main differences are that the yoga has the i7-1260P processor, 1 TB SSD and it seems that a larger battery. The X1 Carbon the i5-1240P, 256 GB SSD, and a lock slot. Any of those processors, even the  i7-1255U is suitable for what I do. SSDs are cheap so I can get a larger one if needed. Battery life is important and security is important.\n\nI use it with Linux so Linux compatibility is important. The X1 Carbon comes with Linux but it seems that the Yoga 9i has good compatibility.\n\nI am traveling a lot and like to bring the laptop along. Last 6 months we backpacked through many countries cities carrying my girlfriend's Dell Inspiron 2 in 1. I love the form factor. It has good specs but the exterior bent in one corner. Also at 1.63 Kg it felt a bit heavy as we carry max 10 Kg in total so cutting down 0.5 Kg (1 pound) seems meaningful.\n\nSo, knowing that here are my questions:\n\n* Is the Yoga sturdy enough to backpack?\n* Is the X1 Carbon as sturdy as it seems?\n* Is the battery life in the X1 Carbon with a \"P\" processor really as bad as the reviews say? Between 4 to 8 hours of real work.\n* Is the battery on the Yoga as good as the reviews say? Between 8 and 10 hours.\n\nThanks",

They essentially double your battery life, as well has being handy when your phone is about to die too. \n\nThe laptop also does get hot. That is a notable concern, as thermal throttling is an issue, as with any other gaming laptop. The slim especially suffers, with it being so slim and all, leading to it impacting performance and leaving the keyboard hot to the touch.

  "I have been seeing quite a few comments on this thread where they are either confusing this with the 2023 model, a 2in1 model and some were even referring SKUs with AMD CPUs which this laptop never even had to begin with, so let me clear this up a bit. \n\nI'd like you to confirm one thing, which is whether you'll need a dGPU because if your work doesn't need it, then you can get laptops with similar specs but without the rtx4050 for less than $1000. Not all codes and programming will depend on GPU, most of them only rely on a powerful CPU. \n\nIf you do need a dGPU, then this would be a pretty decent laptop choice for this price, particularly because of the amazing build quality. This has better battery life than the 2023 model, and should suffice for your needs. This is not a Yoga 2 in 1, which usually have weaker hinges like some comments mention. This has a better and sturdier hinge than those. Not the best hinge, but then again, that's the case for all the manufacturers rn except maybe for Apple and this is better than the ones with plastic lids.\n\nHowever there are better alternatives based on your usecases. If you want a touchscreen, then this is the best one for this price unless you go above $1500. Keep in mind that this is ~2.2kg, it is almost the same as the 16\" MacBook Pro for reference, so you have to decide that you are fine with that. If not, go for something like Asus Zephyrus G16 2024 edition, but you'll lose on the touchscreen and numpad. You can also look at Asus Proart P16 which gives you both numpad and touchscreen. You can also look at some other gaming laptops like LOQs and Legions, they will have slightly better performance, however their build quality is lower than this and they have not as good webcam, mics etc and have much worse speakers and similar weight, if not more. \n\nIn comparison, this is a more all-rounder laptop. If you can stay connected to a power source and are fine with a single type c port (which is TB4, so you can still use high speed docks), then you can also look at the 2023 edition (called Slim Pro 9i in US). Best buy has manufacturer refurbished model (so you still get 1yr warranty from Lenovo and all the perks of a brand new laptop) for less than this price and it includes a mini LED screen, which is much better and brighter. \n\nHope this helps 🙂",
  "Legions with AMD HS processors also have great battery life",
  "It has all the specs of a gaming laptop? Are you just saying it’s not a dedicated gaming rig? Ie fans, etc",
  "What are you talking about?",
  "Your acting like its a gt 1030.",
  "Some laptops made about 6 to 8 years old are like non-destructive. Do what you wanna do and they wont even stop spinning fan. \n\nThe thinkpads are really popular and they are cheap because they are sold to companies by qty of 100-200. It comes too cheap when you buy it like this. Currently in our company some of users has brand new model Lenovo’s from 2020 to 2024. Currently they are coming back to us with too many complaints and it is a problem for me too. I am only using Lenovo Servers because its actually IBM. They are the best on servers. But I can’t say that on the laptops. \n\nI had lenovo too and it was the best performance of its time. Which now when you replace the rams for 20 bucks its the best again. But I tried new lenovo and I was able to see how fast its getting hot, dropping performance issues, battery capacity under 1.30 hour and some other problems.\n\nI see the lenovo is a bad computer brand for gaming currently and I have been fixing, using Asus computers. Before the time they were really good at office pc’s and bad at gaming sector. But now they all maintain it on gaming and making some big movements.\n\nSorry if my words seen as like an absolute closed minded. I was not trying to describe it as like that but I can tell I am an ASUS person (Wrote this on a M1 Macbook which has no gpu other than cpu)",
  "So here is the problem, I can’t because im in Turkey. We have prices for real_price * 3 and If I say this one is on that range, it might not be. But here is the model I would recommend for you to search;\n\nhttps://www.asus.com/laptops/for-gaming/all-series/filter?SubSeries=ROG-Zephyrus (This would be the best fit for you in school, I don’t know the price in your country but in here its around 82.000 TL which is around 2100€ )\n\nhttps://www.asus.com/laptops/for-gaming/tuf-gaming/asus-tuf-gaming-a14-2024/",
  "I think you are confusing it with the 2023 version. This was the 2024 version which fixed some of the main issues of 2023 version to some extent by increasing the battery size to 84 Wh, adding a second USB-C port and giving HDMI2.1 instead of 1.4b. Giving he's looking at the LCD version, it should give 2-3 hrs extra battery life.",
  "He's saying a 4050 is shit for gaming...",
  "Ah, you're right. Thank you. I stand corrected. I assume the more efficient Ultra9 185H also contributes to better battery life compared to the i9-13905H.",
  "lol oh. To his point the 4050 isn’t the best, but it is certainly capable of 60 FPS on 90% of games.   A fantastic entry level card.",
  "But you'll only get 53FPS on highest quality brand new AAA games. Literally unusable /s",
  "Games haven't been good for the last 10 years except for a few and this card handles those fine. No everyone wants to play the latest crapware. He will be fine.",

  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",

  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",

  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb.

  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Which one is better for a daily and normal use? I don’t mind the price difference. ",
  "Lenovo has powerful processor and high resolution display\nAsus has better battery performance",
  "First one is a really good deal!!",

  "you may not have lived the time where the hinges are so bad on Lenovo laptops. ThinkPad are an exception though",
  "Id allways buy Asus over Lenovo as im tired of either having features cut away for no reason or of my stuff being build poorly",
  "I will mainly use it for college and for watching media but i want a laptop that’s good so i don’t mind the price. I might play some video games but i have a pc at home so i will only play if im away. Which one should i get?",
  "long term reliability has been going down hill for a few yrs now even in their premium products. Quality control downfall.",
  "The 2-in-1, you can flip it around and use it on the sofa while watching a movie.",
  "You can get the one with higher resolution that can improve watching media if you wanna watch some movie in high quality or something , but if you wanna play games these laptops depend on igpus so they are weak, so don't expect much from them in that case, also what are the specs of your desktop if you don't mind sharing?",
  "Yeah i will mainly use it for movies and all that but if it’s weak for games i will probably just play them on my pc but im not playing too much lately so i don’t mind. My pc has a Ryzen 7 2700x, gtx 1660 and 16gb of ram, i got it a while ago but it’s still pretty good for what i use it for",
  "With that price range you can get some pretty good laptop with dedicated gpu like rtx 4050 which is pretty powerful not just for gaming but for everything else as well , even more than gtx 1660 by far, instead of getting an igpu that's weak for gaming, but if gaming isn't one of your concerns then you can go for the one shown in the picture above, it's up to you at this point just keep that in mind",
  "I was thinking about that but i figured maybe i will not even use it for gaming at all. I think im going to buy the Lenovo Yoga, thank you so much for all your help!!",
  "You're most welcome bro👍",
  "Just keep in mind with the yoga you will need a new laptop in 2 years because the hinges fail",
  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget €2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years.

I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around €2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. €1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. €1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. €1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. €2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. €2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** €2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",
  "Have you ruled out Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024 or 2025)? It is a cheaper Asus ProArt with the same of internals.  These Asus model carry the best speakers of all Windows laptops which is nice to have if you have kids or others to share a screen.",
  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",
  "Question: why are you listing high refresh rate laptops? Is that something you want?\n\nBecause I doubt you’ll max out that refresh rate in games unless you play older games or competitive online games.\n\nEdit: nvm just saw you don’t care about games.",

  "Also, unlike the ProArt you don't need to pay for a 4070 you said you wouldn't be using much. The 16:10 screen is also good for web development with it's bit of extra height. P1's are also pretty much the top of the Thinkpad scale, being workstation laptops and thus very solid. P1 gen 7 is also 17mm thick and 2kg so pretty portable.",
  "You're right, I never game but do appreciate a nice smooth screen. High refresh rate is not a must have but more a nice to have.",
  "I will take a look, thanks",
  "Thanks. A lot of praise online for Thinkpads",
  "2 in 1 laptop purchase confusion I am starting college and reading all the good and bad reviews has made me more confused.\nI read bad reviews about hp envy and pavillion 360.

  "These 2-in-1 eventually will have some sort of weakness, either too weak for multitask or too hot and noisy due to the thinness, and the cheaper model will likely failed at the hinge. Good for occasionally small edit, but if you intend to extensively taking note during the entire day then a tablet will did a much better job. Get yourself an iPad (or S series of Samsung tablet), a good ol' reliable laptop like a Thinkpad (if you need Linux), sync the note between them and you're good. Looks for refurbish option if your budget is limited - both laptop and tablet, even with specs from 4-5 years ago, still perfectly good enough for your need.",

  "Well people will only post if their machine have problems, so that's what you'll see.\n\nYes, if you have yet own a laptop then definitely get one first.

  "I did work a while ago on my 11 yr old ThinkPad so...",
  "new laptop experience: lenovo 9i 2-in-1 & omnibook ultra flip My old Yoga c920 (bought in 2018) ended its own life a couple of months ago, so needed a replacement 2-in-1. Discovered I wanted a Lunar Lake cpu, as on the HW side my main wants are single threaded processing and battery life, so LL suits me perfectly. Also, I care about build quality, I want at least several years of usage.\n\nFound that by far the best reviews are [https://www.notebookcheck.net/](https://www.notebookcheck.net/), but its a bit awkward to get the ones you want listed neatly.  Go there, select \"reviews\", search once & it will show advanced search options, set device class to \"convertible\" and type of review to \"notebookcheck reviews only\".\n\nSeems clear that right now the Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 and HP Omnibook Ultra Flip are the best candidates (also: ASUS Vivobook Flip looks good; and Thinkpads are nice but battery is not so good).\n\nImo Lenovo has an really unacceptable amount of \"bad hinges\" reviews around, mostly on their mid/low end machines: the cause is that they've been using glue where they should be using screws to attach the hinges to the display chassis (many other manufacturers also do/did this - however my old c920 with the \"watchband\" style hinge did it the proper way). For this reason I avoided the Yoga 7 series entirely, maybe they've fixed its problems by now but idk. With the Omnibook Ultra Flip you can check its maintenance manual online and find a diagram showing that all of its hinges are screwed into the metal chassis as they should be (looks not that hard to disassemble either). However Lenovo treats the whole display+hinge assembly as a single \"FPU unit\" which means you can't see inside it in the manuals to find out what's going on, or easily disassemble.\n\nSo I bought the Omnibook and it arrived 24 hours later. Build quality on it felt really great, looked like a really nice machine. Sadly the keyboard was not a proper UK keyboard (tbf to HP they do warn about this  - [https://support.hp.com/sg-en/document/ish\\_7481525-7481612-16](https://support.hp.com/sg-en/document/ish_7481525-7481612-16) \\- but I hadn't noticed it). It is just a US layout with some keys relabelled afaics. Result is that, for the UK, backslash is in totally the wrong place and is obtained as fn+L, also enter and backspace are the wrong shapes & in slightly wrong place. So back it goes, I use all those keys a lot and I'm not spending this amount of money to have to fiddle with a different keyboard layout to all my other machines. HP support was easy to deal with, they accepted the return without any problems or extra cost.\n\nSooo I bought the Yoga 9 2-in-1 as second choice. Only the \"aura edition\" is available currently in the UK, so I have that. On that:\n\n\\- It doesn't feel quite as solidly built as the Omnibook ultra did, but it still feels very good. I'm happy here, but can't tell if hinges are screwed in screen chassis vs some less good construction, so I'll just have to treat it gently.\n\n\\- Screen is awesome. I have the 2.8K screen, which all reviews recommended over the 4K. (Had some fun with my custom rainmeter skins and UI scaling but sorted it out.)\n\n\\- Battery life is very good, I get well over a whole days usage doing light work on it.\n\n\\- Keys and touchpad feel good, I don't think I am very fussy here. See bit below about the \"extra\" keys on the lenovo 9 series.\n\n\\- Ofc I've gone for a 2-in-1 because I sometimes need to write on the screen. It came with a pen that works well. The screen is smooth glass - I guess it is not as nice as e.g. a Remarkable tablet to write on, but it still works well. I made a presentation with 25 handwritten slides as the first usage of the new machine, no complaints.\n\n\\- No fan noise unless it is under load. I'm happy using it.\n\n\\- It took about 3 weeks to arrive.\n\n\\- I got the \"base\" lunar lake 9i 2-in-1 model with the 256V and 16GB RAM. If you need more RAM (I don't) then maybe worth getting one of the other models, otherwise not worth it afaics.\n\n\\- There is some bloatware but its easily dealt with. I have no idea what all the \"aura\" stuff even does, probably uninstalled it without using it, idk. Also my first time doing anything non-superficial with win11...  seems like many of win11s original UI regressions on win10 have been sorted out, but the Win11 taskbar/startmenu is still a horrible disaster (it still looks like it was built for a phone ffs) so I did get Stardock Start11, and that works nicely.\n\n\\- All the \"AI\" stuff isn't much use to me. It's cute that windows Click To Do can recognize text from within images but I can't find anything else useful than it can do (also, that really did not need a special chip with 40 TOPS...). I tried asking questions to copilot a few times and it was waste of time - for simple stuff it was no better than better using a search engine yourself and for complicated stuff it just talks crap.\n\n\\- There is a row of four \"extra\" keys on the right of the keyboard. They get in the way a bit at first but I've got used to them in about a day - had to learn that \"smack little finger down near edge of laptop\" is no longer a good strategy when I want to press enter. Overall I like the features these keys access but I'd rather the keys weren't there, not the best use of space imo, but its ok. (Page up/down + home + end keys would be more useful imo.)\n\nI didn't find much info about the keys online so here goes: one changes the \"power mode\" (3 modes: battery, balanced, perf) and is fairly useful because the cpu has both P and E cores, so (amongst other things) it gives some control over which set of cores you want to be using. Discovered this by running hwinfo whilst changing the power mode.\n\nThe next one changes the \"audio mode\" and is totally pointless, the machine has great sound whatever mode its in. The third changes \"eyecare mode\" and is a slightly useful to me - I have f.lux on constantly filtering blue light, and this key then acts as a toggle to add some extra strength to the filter on top of what f.lux does. The fourth key is configurable, I set it to open my most-used application.",
  "hello there, thanks for this comparison. I'm currently deciding between these two. May I know if you have the 2025 gen 10 for the Yoga? Do you see any screen door effect on the Yoga? I currently have the Omnibook Ultra Flip 14, got it at a really nice price but the screendoor effect on the OLED display is killing the deal for me. I'm wondering if the Yoga also has the same issue?\n\nI was trying out a Yoga 7 Slim (with touchscreen), it doesnt have such issue.\n\nThanks a lot!",
  "Yes, the gen 10 (gen 9 does not have lunar lake). I did not see a screen door effect on either the omnibook or the 9i with 2.8K. Imo the 9i 2.8K has the better screen, but I would have happily had either screen.",
  "Need help to with choices I'm currently trying to find a good portable device to use for 30% school, 50% 3D modeling/CAD work, and 20% gaming. \n\nI'm stuck between the yoga pro 9i, zephyrus G14, and one of the surface pros/laptops. The min specs I'm looking for are at least 32GB Ram and RTX 4050 or up, good battery life, and preferably at the lighter side (I know asking a lot haha). From what I can tell, most of these configurations have good CPUs that would work well but I'm seeing reviews that are discouraging.\n\nThe newer surfaces have the snapdragon and while many say it's good, it requires emulation to run some of the CAD work I do, which many have stated causes poor performance so I don't think the surfaces would work well no matter how much I love the tablet functionality and weight. \n\nThe zephyrus has an OLED panel which is super nice and it's light. I've seen some mention overheating and fan noise, with battery life while under load not being great. The biggest issue is that it's pretty pricey and the wattage limit on the 4070 GPU is a big bummer for the extra price you pay. It's probably one of the more expensive options right above the yoga. \n\nI've had a yoga before and really liked it so that kinda the reason I was eyeing one of these. The 4050 with the i9 seems like a good price for what you get. My cons are that it's heavier and apparently the battery life it really bad. \n\nJust looking to see what other would recommend for what I'm looking for. Maybe some of y'all have experience with the devices mentioned and can give me some first hand experience. Appreciate it everyone!!",
  "Help deciding between these Lenovo ThinkPad and Dell Inspiron laptops - any insight appreciated I need to make a decision on a new laptop and could use help deciding. I'm down to the ones listed in the below table (though if you think I should consider a different one let me know). I don't use this for anything particularly intensive or specific (e.g., no gaming, programming, CAD, etc), this is just an all-around laptop. I would say my main criteria is reliability/build quality - I tend to keep laptops a long time (e.g. 8-10 years) so I want this to last a long time. That said, I would appreciate a nice screen (I do use it for some photo/video editing) and would like decent battery life (though it spends most of its time plugged in).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/709cqhhecbke1.jpg?width=1110&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee5190ab219f2ce43705c9a4dff1d2b935e69fc9\n\nHere is my current thinking on these - I would appreciate anyone's input/thoughts, personal experience, etc.\n\n* **Lenovo vs. Dell** \\- I like Lenovo a lot, I have one for my work computer and I love the keyboard. I'm leaning that way, but per the below I am trying to figure out why I wouldn't get the Dell...\n* **Yoga 9i** \\- I love this and this was going to be my choice (particularly love the design and screen), but I'm concerned about (i) only 16 GB of RAM (I could bump it up but that's $500-600 more) and (ii) lots of reviews say the real-world battery life is very poor.\n* **X1 Carbon Gen 11** \\- I know this is a prior gen but the new one is too expensive. Main concern with this one is the lower resolution screen (obviously has an older processor, but again shouldn't make a huge difference in what I use it for).\n* **ThinkPad T14** \\- This is obviously more expensive and has the same drawback of lower quality screen, but it's on the list because (i) it seems to be basically a tank that would last a long time (and could be easily repaired if need be) and (ii) it comes with a 3-year warranty.\n* **Dell Inspiron** \\- The background here is I went to Micro Center to try out the Lenovos and saw the stats on this one and I'm basically trying to figure out what the catch is with this. It generally has the same or better specs than all the others for quite a bit cheaper. What is the catch or drawback with this one? My one concern (other than the fact that I must be missing something) is that it has a lower brightness of 300 nits (which I feel could be an annoyance when using it in a bright room for example).\n\nI hope to buy this in the next day or so, so thanks for all the help!",

Specs: Ryzen AI 9 HX370, 32GB RAM, 4060 8GB VRAM, 4k 60Hz 16 inch touch display.\n\nHi, I’ve been looking for a new laptop to replace my 5 year old surface laptop 3. I need a new laptop mainly for my engineering degree and I will also use it for some casual gaming and photo editing. So basically I’m searching for a portable laptop with a good CPU, a dGPU (doesnt have to be the most powerful), a high definition screen ,and good battery life.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits I see in this laptop is that it is a very powerful device in a very light and portable form factor and (by what I have seen in reviews) good battery life. It also has such a gorgeous design and with the 4k screen it looks so nice (although I know it is overkill), but I don’t know if the 60Hz will be a bummer. For context, I don’t have a single device with a high refresh screen so I wont be “downgrading”. I’ll be traveling in January and will buy it then so I don’t have the opportunity to see it in person until then and once I am on holidays I can’t spend a ton of time comparing laptops.\n\nOther options: I’ve seen are the PX13, Yoga Pro 9i, and the Yoga Pro 7i but these feel less complete than the P16. The PX13 has bad battery life although I like the form factor, the yoga pro 9i is so heavy (more than 500g heavier), and the yoga pro 7i has an intel chip which I have seen that are worse than the new zen 5 amd chips.\n\nWhat do you think about the P16 for my use case at around $1800 usd? Is it the right option or should I go with another one?\n\nThank you to anyone who takes the time to answer this question I will be very grateful.",

  "Help choosing my next machine for school and voice acting work? My current rig is an Alienware m17 r4, a monster of a laptop that can’t run longer than an hour unplugged and sounds like a passenger plane when running. My plan is to plant it firmly on my desk at home as a desktop replacement and get something smaller and much more utilitarian for personal use and on-the-go. \n\nI’m looking to get a good 2-in-1 convertible or detachable laptop that has a pen or stylus for handwritten notes and utility (for school, D&D, etc) as well as enough power and the ability to run applications such as Adobe Audition for my voice acting and VMWare for virtual machines for schoolwork. I’d like to have a long-lasting battery life, and it ideally needs to be quiet enough that I can record voiceover without too much if any background fan noise.\n\nI’ve looked into a few machines already. I was really considering a Surface Pro 11, but the Snapdragon X Elite doesn’t support most Adobe programs or any audio suites like Audition. Otherwise, it would have been a very very strong contender. I’ve also liked the size and style of the Yoga 9i with pen, but I don’t love that the pen doesn’t charge while stored, and the reviews I’ve watched and read are all over the place. I haven’t dug too deep into others, and it got a little overwhelming.\n\nAnother option I considered was getting a 13” iPad Pro m4 with keyboard and pen and using it as a functional tablet. I do really really love this idea, as I’ve wanted an iPad Pro for years, but it would only be good for my personal uses like dnd games and research and browsing. It wouldn’t support my voice acting programs or the programs I need for my cybersecurity degree. My Alienware certainly does, but again, the noise and battery life are a big issue for me, not to mention not being able to work on homework on the go. \n\nBudget isn’t a huge issue with the likes of payment plans and such, but I’d really like to stick below $2500 if possible, ideally in the $1500-$2000 range.

  "Need help choosing next work laptop. I have two for your review. Hi all,\n\nI have a budget of no more than $1400.00. The laptop will be used with very large spreadsheets that are giving my current laptop trouble. i7-10510U with 16gb ddr4 1330MHz Windows 10 Pro Nvidia GeForce MX330\n\nThere are some good sales going on right now. I'm avoiding the $999 gaming laptops because of their abysmal battery life, how heavy they are, and the huge power supplies. But processor performance and ram are my main concerns. The ability to tackle a huge spreadsheet without having to close other programs or crash my pc. I don't really care about how pretty the screen is or if it has a dedicated graphics card. I don't think i really need either of those things.\n\nFor your consideration first up we have the: ThinkPad P16s Gen 2 AMD (16″) Mobile Workstation - Thunder Black that I can pickup direct from Lenovo's website for **$1,339.01**. Part Number 21K90038US It says it has the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 7840U Processor, Windows 11 Pro 64, integrated AMD Radeon™ 780M, 64 GB LPDDR5X-6400MHz (Soldered), 1 TB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 Performance TLC Opal. 4 Cell Li-Polymer 86Wh  \n[Lenovo ThinkPad direct from Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com/us/lenovopro/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadp/thinkpad-p16s-gen-2-16-inch-amd-mobile-workstation/21k90038us)\n\nSecond up we have the: Lenovo - Yoga Pro 9i 16\" 3.2K Touchscreen Laptop - Intel Core Ultra 9 185H with 32GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 - 1TB SSD - Luna Grey  Model:83DN0006US  SKU:6571367 that I can pickup from Best Buy for **$1,299.99** or less if I try to get one of their open box options.\n\n[Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i from Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-yoga-pro-9i-16-3-2k-touchscreen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-9-185h-with-32gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4050-1tb-ssd-luna-grey/6571367.p?skuId=6571367)\n\nThe price differences here aren't much, but the hardware setups are pretty different. I am attracted to the 64gb of ram on the one laptop, but it only has dedicated graphics which i think would be fine. The Yoga has an Nvidia 4050 and 32gb ram with a completely diff processor that looks to be slightly better. Another thing i considered is not getting too beastly of a pc that I can create spreadsheets fine, but when i share them with others their pc then crashes. Maybe i should stick to 32gb ram for that reason? I appreciate any input you can provide.

  "Need a system for productivity, VM work, and light gaming with good battery I get into a lot of network simulation like GNS3 and EveNG to run network devices and systems VMs. I also am taking some online ethical hacking courses that uses a lot of VMs for Linux and windows. I don’t like staying plugged in all the time, so I’m trying to find a good mix.\n\nLast year i bought the Yoga Slim 9i 16” and it was fantastic except the battery. That was a joke. It would die with casual use within 2-3 hours or less, and that was with me turning down settings and going to 60hz.

(Has mixed reviews and a loud track which can annoy me)\n\nI am also trying to stick to under $1500.\n\nIf anybody else knows of something, my needs are:\n16” Nice screen w/ higher resolution (doesn’t have to be 4k) don’t care about high refresh rate on laptops. I’ve had it, and it didn’t much for me.\n32-64GB of ram (VMs take up a lot of ram)\nMany CORES (Ultra 9 has more than 8840U or HS, but not sure how much that will impact VM use)\nGood battery life without having to make it feel like a $300 laptop in features.\nNumberpad - Inputting IP address on a top row of keys is horrible. I have to do that some when i work remote for my job since my work laptop is 14”\n\nThere are a ton of options that fit all of this except battery life. It sucks to constantly worry about plugging in to keep working. I wanted the new Ryzen Ai 370 but there are no systems that meet my criteria except one new MSi system that is priced too high for the specs.

As a civil engineering student, I need a Windows laptop with strong performance to handle CAD software and, most importantly, one that will stand the test of time. I've been searching for a week now, spending hours each day, but the options are overwhelming, and none of them seem to stand out as the clear best choice. That's why I could really use your help.\n\nI'm far from an expert in this area, so advice from people who know more than me would be incredibly valuable.

Here are some of the options I've found that meet my basic criteria (satisfactory processor, 32 GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD):\n\n* **Lenovo Yoga 9i Pro Gen 9:** Looks really promising, but the battery life concerns me, especially at this price point, considering that I don't game.\n* **Asus Zenbook S16:** I've read some reviews claiming this is the best laptop of 2024, while others criticize its cooling issues, particularly the keyboard, and suggest that the processor’s performance isn’t as great as it looks on paper.\n* **Asus Zenbook 14/14X/14 Pro:** This is currently my top contender because it seems versatile and has received a lot of positive feedback. However, I'm still undecided on which model to go for, though the Zenbook 14X looks really appealing in certain configurations.\n* **Dell XPS 13/15:** I've seen many positive comments about Dell's XPS series, but there are also concerns regarding their durability and cooling system.\n\nI've also had Lenovo ThinkPads recommended to me, but there are so many models that I'm not sure which are the most worthwhile. The same goes for Dell Latitude and Precision series.\n\nAgain, I’m not an expert, but this is an important purchase for my studies, and I want to make the best choice possible.

I tried buying a USB-A to HDMI adapter (none of my adapters have USB-C out ports but they have USB3.0) but they required to install some suspicious drivers, I tried USBA-USBC adapters (even the ones that CLAIM to be for video don't work), I tried a USB-C splitter (granted, I didn't see the product description for that one said it was for charging and audio only). At this point I am frantically checking Amazon reviews for products and there's always a bunch of reviews that say \"HDMI stopped working after 3 days\" or \"HDMI doesn't work\" so maybe a dock with two USBC out ports might work?

Doesn't have to be super fast, just capable. Being a multi-disciplinary artist who switches from drawing to photo-editing to writing, etc., I believe my use case is above the average user's, though I'm not sure if I'd be considered a power-user because I wouldn't be editing photos and videos all the time. (I tend to alternate programs/activities as a freelancer.)\n\n- I will mostly use it at home, but I still prefer something light that I can carry around.\n\n- **Longevity** is very, very important. All my laptops have lasted for 7+ years.\n\n- Future-proofing is also important. I don't mind soldered computer parts as long as it has enough power. Because of the sad state of my 2GB laptop, I'd like to go **16GB** this time.\n\n- Long battery life is not topmost priority but it would be good to have since I noticed its the batteries that always die on me.\n\n- I use an old, entry-level Wacom drawing tablet without a screen, so it would be really nice to upgrade to drawing directly on screen. However, I  am willing to stick with my old Wacom if there is too much risk in using a 2-in-1. (My research tells me I can't afford two quality devices. Please let me know if you have suggestions!) I prioritize good build and longevity over a touchscreen.\n\n- Good screen and color-accuracy is important. But like touchscreen, I'm ok if it's not OLED-quality if it's going to affect longevity.\n\n- High storage capacity is good-to-have but not a requirement because all my files are in external HDDs.\n \n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**\n \nLight weight is important because I have a weak back and it hurts my shoulders whenever I have a laptop on my bag.\n \n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** \n \nAverage screen size? 13-14\". I don't think I can afford above 14\" and that might be heavier.\n \n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** \n\nUsual tasks:\n- writing\n- drawing\n- graphic design\n- vector art\n- photo-editing\n- light video-editing (below 4k)\n- using programs like sketchup is a plus, but I don't really do 3D beyond generating poses and designing floorplans for personal use (at the moment, I just use my phone for anything 3D-related)\n\nI currently use Adobe PS, AI, InDesign, and SAI, but I don't mind switching programs. I'm actually planning to move to one-time purchase and free products like Affinity and Krita. I heard it's less power-intensive than Adobe.\n \n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**\n \nI'm not really a PC gamer. I play Genshin Impact on medium-quality settings on mobile, but I'm ok if I can't do it on pc.\n \n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** \n \nPlease read priorities above. Generally speaking, I'm not nitpicky on keyboards and extra bells and whistles. I just want it to be capable and of good quality. Privacy features are a bonus because I value security.\n \n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**\n\nCurrent candidates:\n\nLenovo Yoga 7\n16 GB RAM, 512 GB storage, Intel or Ryzen\n\nPros\n- touchscreen\n- pen seems ok when I tested it in-store on another model (9i)\n- seems capable of handling all my tasks, according to reviews\n- might go down in price if I put it off for next year\n\nCons\n- I heard 2-in-1s are likely to have issues because of the hinges and screen breaking too soon.\n- They say OLED screens will \"burn in\" in only a few years.\n- Not really recommended for video-editing because it doesn't have a dedicated graphics.\n\nMacbook Air\n16 GB RAM, 256 GB storage, M2\n\nPros\n- Has a reputation for good build quality and longevity\n- More secure than Windows\n- Go-to device/brand by creatives\n- Website (and reviewers) say it can handle up to 4k editing.\n- Device looks beautiful and lightweight\n\nCons\n- Need to adjust to a new OS (last time I used a mac was over a decade ago) and reformat external HDDs\n- Will have to sacrifice the chance to use touchscreen\n- For the 81k price, I only get the basic storage (Can you edit artworks/videos while it's on an external?)\n\nI've looked at other brands, but they usually have inconsistent reviews, especially when it comes to longevity and quality. These two seems to be what's recommended for my budget.\n\nI'm also considering finding a budget non-touch laptop with graphics card to pair it with a cheap tablet for drawing, but I haven't found one that I like yet. Seems like I'll have to sacrifice a lot if I try to go with two new devices. (Bulk, tablet quality, screen quality, to name a few)\n\nI know I'm asking a lot, I would truly appreciate it if redditors and artists/creatives can offer device and setup recommendations as well as first-hand experience.\n\nThank you so much!",
  "dell xps or precision line are good for creatives and if you wanna switch to linux later it's so easy. \n\nI use a dell inspiron 15 on mint linux and everything works and it's great for music production so for your use it would be great. I only paid 450 brand new too for this!! but I did pay extra for preiumum support but it wasn't much extra..",
  "Thank you for the suggestion, I'll look into it! I've never tried any Dell laptops before. Is the quality consistent regardless of model?\n\nAlso, why Linux? (Genuine question, I've never met a creative on Linux.)\n\nThanks!!",
  "You're welcome! And they are pretty good.Way better than HP and the lenovo think books that feel fragile. \n\nI use Linux cuz im tired of microsoft bloat lol... win 11 on this laptop feels not so buttery smooth that mint linux feels. plus less telemetry n stuff too and I have way more freedom to configure Linux as I please. Windpows 11 is so limited.",
  "Thanks for explaining! Yeah, Microsoft bloat is an issue. I don't think I'm techie enough to configure a new OS but I'll look into Dell. I didn't like HP when I tested one in store and the Thinkbooks are out of my price range.",
  "Cool. Good luck"
