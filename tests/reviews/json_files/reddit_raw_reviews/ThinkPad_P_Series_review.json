  "Looking to buy new laptop under 1200 USD Hey Everyone,\n\nTLDR - \n\nLooking to Buy a reliable professional-grade laptop around 300,000 PKR with strong CPU performance, expandable RAM and SSD options, a capable GPU for rendering, decoding, and solid build quality. Preferably new with local warranty support.\n\nAny recommendations or feedback would be highly appreciated.\n\n\\------------------\n\n# Back Story\n\nAfter a long while, I have finally decided to upgrade my laptop, but the current market dynamics is too confusing for me right now esp. between currency hit, price differences, open-box deals, and Masked/refurbished options, it has been difficult to decide on a laptop that truly fits my needs. I would really appreciate some input from the community.\n\n# Current Setup\n\nI’m currently using an HP ProBook 450 G5 (8th Gen). It has served me well, but it’s beginning to show its age, especially under heavier workloads.\n\n# Requirements\n\nCore Specifications\n\nCondition: Brand new preferred  \nCPU: Intel i7 (H-series or equivalent or better)  \nRAM: 24 GB (16 GB minimum with expansion slot - no soldered ones)  \nStorage - (Must be SSD + HDD option)\n\n* SSD 512 GB for OS (second slot for future expansion is a plus)\n* HDD SATA 1 TB (2.5” inch)\n\nDisplay: At least IPS with decent color accuracy & brightness  \nGPU: Nvidia RTX Ada series or something slightly stronger for rendering, encoding/decoding performance. I can work with gaming series but no older than 4000 series.  \n  \nPorts and Connectivity\n\n* Multiple USB A/B/C 2.0/3.0 ports for accessories (mouse, external drives, cooling stand)\n* 3.5 mm audio jack\n* VGA/HDMI port for external display\n* RJ45 LAN port\n* Wi-Fi 4/5 GHz support\n\nKeyboard and Build\n\n* Full-size backlit keyboard (numpad preferred)\n* Rigid build with minimal flex or hinge wobble. Weight isnt an issue.\n* Easy to open for cleaning or upgrades\n* Local parts availability for future maintenance\n\n# Usage Pattern\n\n* My workload involves heavy office use with constant multitasking, often running numerous browser tabs alongside background tools for downloading and file-syncing. Current system starts to lag with ram & cpu reaching max capacity before apps start crashing.\n* I do not play games on the laptop as I have a ps5 pro for that - so I dont require top end latest GPU.\n\n# Not Considering\n\n* MacBooks, due to hardware/software compatibility issues with some custom tools I use.\n* Touchscreen, 2-in-1, tablets, flipbooks or hand-held devices\n* Desktops, as I often work from multiple client offices and need portability\n\n# Current Thoughts\n\n* I’ve been considering Lenovo ThinkPad T or P Series, but many models seem to use TFT panels by default. \n* HP Victus models have good specifications but poor reviews regarding build quality, screen wobble, and keyboard flex. \n* I’m also uncertain about Intel versus Ryzen options and would appreciate insights on that. \n* My goal is to move to at least an IPS panel, since my current laptop has a TFT. OLED would be ideal, but likely beyond budget.\n\n# Budget: \n\nAround 300,000 PKR\n\n# Important Points\n\n* Models that offer the best balance of performance, portability, display & build quality\n* I would prefer numpad on keyboard but if laptop model is worth it then I can compromise as a trade off.\n\nI know I might be asking for a lot, but any advice or recommendations would really help. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to share their thoughts.",

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "What laptop should I get? I'm an engineering student who also works in research and coding, and I'm looking for a new laptop. I was currently using my dad's old ThinkPad T450s, and it lasted 8 years and still works smoothly, but the battery life has deteriorated a lo,t and it's just not portable anymore. I'm looking for a new laptop on a more student-friendly budget that would work well with VSCode/Vim, Linux, and VMs. Here are some of my choices:\n\n**ThinkPad E-series 14:**\n\n* Intel Core Ultra 5 125U Processor (E-cores up to 3.60 GHz, P-cores up to 4.30 GHz)\n* 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\n* Windows 11 Home\n* Cost: ₹68.9k\n\nI don't know much about the quality and performance of the ThinkPad E-series, though. Since it has a U-processor, I'm a bit unsure about its performance.\n\n**Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3:**\n\n* 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13620H processor\n* 16GB RAM LPDDR5-4800 | 512GB SSD, expandable up to 1TB\n* Cost: ₹66k\n\nHonestly, the processor seems good, but I've heard negative reviews about the build quality of IdeaPads.\n\n**MacBook Air:**\n\n* Apple M1 chip\n* 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage\n* Cost: ₹59k\n\nAlthough I've heard positive reviews of MacBook Airs from professionals, the storage throws me off a bit, and many people don't recommend them for college.\n\nSome of the other laptops I've considered are Lenovo LOQ and ASUS, but these are my personal top choices. If you guys have any suggestions for any other laptops or experience with any of the laptops listed above, I'd appreciate any advice.",
  "I am also looking at laptops but I can say one thing for sure. **Do not buy a MacBook**, a lot of engineering software is not compatible or doesn't run well. I get that they are attractive in terms of battery life and power but it's just not good for this type of work. \n\n\nI also noticed that intel works a bit better with low level programming and is a bit more stable with Linux. The new intel CPUs are quite nice with battery life and performance. \n\nFrom the laptops that you provided I would get the ThinkPad with intel 5 125U, the performance is alright, I am using a Ryzen 5 5600H and this intel is better in every way. The build quality on ThinkPad was always ok, the E series are a budget friendly for people that can't buy a T series or X1.\n\nEdit: the CPU in the IdeaPad is going to be a bit more powerful in computing but the integrated graphics are way worse and the power efficiency is also worse, so I guess if you value battery life and graphics, the ultra is the obvious choice.",
  "I'm considering a thinkpad with ryzen 7 since it's also budget friendly. Def not considering a macbook anymore. Thanks for the advice",
  "new laptop experience: lenovo 9i 2-in-1 & omnibook ultra flip My old Yoga c920 (bought in 2018) ended its own life a couple of months ago, so needed a replacement 2-in-1. Discovered I wanted a Lunar Lake cpu, as on the HW side my main wants are single threaded processing and battery life, so LL suits me perfectly. Also, I care about build quality, I want at least several years of usage.\n\nFound that by far the best reviews are [https://www.notebookcheck.net/](https://www.notebookcheck.net/), but its a bit awkward to get the ones you want listed neatly.  Go there, select \"reviews\", search once & it will show advanced search options, set device class to \"convertible\" and type of review to \"notebookcheck reviews only\".\n\nSeems clear that right now the Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 and HP Omnibook Ultra Flip are the best candidates (also: ASUS Vivobook Flip looks good; and Thinkpads are nice but battery is not so good).\n\nImo Lenovo has an really unacceptable amount of \"bad hinges\" reviews around, mostly on their mid/low end machines: the cause is that they've been using glue where they should be using screws to attach the hinges to the display chassis (many other manufacturers also do/did this - however my old c920 with the \"watchband\" style hinge did it the proper way). For this reason I avoided the Yoga 7 series entirely, maybe they've fixed its problems by now but idk. With the Omnibook Ultra Flip you can check its maintenance manual online and find a diagram showing that all of its hinges are screwed into the metal chassis as they should be (looks not that hard to disassemble either). However Lenovo treats the whole display+hinge assembly as a single \"FPU unit\" which means you can't see inside it in the manuals to find out what's going on, or easily disassemble.\n\nSo I bought the Omnibook and it arrived 24 hours later. Build quality on it felt really great, looked like a really nice machine. Sadly the keyboard was not a proper UK keyboard (tbf to HP they do warn about this  - [https://support.hp.com/sg-en/document/ish\\_7481525-7481612-16](https://support.hp.com/sg-en/document/ish_7481525-7481612-16) \\- but I hadn't noticed it). It is just a US layout with some keys relabelled afaics. Result is that, for the UK, backslash is in totally the wrong place and is obtained as fn+L, also enter and backspace are the wrong shapes & in slightly wrong place. So back it goes, I use all those keys a lot and I'm not spending this amount of money to have to fiddle with a different keyboard layout to all my other machines. HP support was easy to deal with, they accepted the return without any problems or extra cost.\n\nSooo I bought the Yoga 9 2-in-1 as second choice. Only the \"aura edition\" is available currently in the UK, so I have that. On that:\n\n\\- It doesn't feel quite as solidly built as the Omnibook ultra did, but it still feels very good. I'm happy here, but can't tell if hinges are screwed in screen chassis vs some less good construction, so I'll just have to treat it gently.\n\n\\- Screen is awesome. I have the 2.8K screen, which all reviews recommended over the 4K. (Had some fun with my custom rainmeter skins and UI scaling but sorted it out.)\n\n\\- Battery life is very good, I get well over a whole days usage doing light work on it.\n\n\\- Keys and touchpad feel good, I don't think I am very fussy here. See bit below about the \"extra\" keys on the lenovo 9 series.\n\n\\- Ofc I've gone for a 2-in-1 because I sometimes need to write on the screen. It came with a pen that works well. The screen is smooth glass - I guess it is not as nice as e.g. a Remarkable tablet to write on, but it still works well. I made a presentation with 25 handwritten slides as the first usage of the new machine, no complaints.\n\n\\- No fan noise unless it is under load. I'm happy using it.\n\n\\- It took about 3 weeks to arrive.\n\n\\- I got the \"base\" lunar lake 9i 2-in-1 model with the 256V and 16GB RAM. If you need more RAM (I don't) then maybe worth getting one of the other models, otherwise not worth it afaics.\n\n\\- There is some bloatware but its easily dealt with. I have no idea what all the \"aura\" stuff even does, probably uninstalled it without using it, idk. Also my first time doing anything non-superficial with win11...  seems like many of win11s original UI regressions on win10 have been sorted out, but the Win11 taskbar/startmenu is still a horrible disaster (it still looks like it was built for a phone ffs) so I did get Stardock Start11, and that works nicely.\n\n\\- All the \"AI\" stuff isn't much use to me. It's cute that windows Click To Do can recognize text from within images but I can't find anything else useful than it can do (also, that really did not need a special chip with 40 TOPS...). I tried asking questions to copilot a few times and it was waste of time - for simple stuff it was no better than better using a search engine yourself and for complicated stuff it just talks crap.\n\n\\- There is a row of four \"extra\" keys on the right of the keyboard. They get in the way a bit at first but I've got used to them in about a day - had to learn that \"smack little finger down near edge of laptop\" is no longer a good strategy when I want to press enter. Overall I like the features these keys access but I'd rather the keys weren't there, not the best use of space imo, but its ok. (Page up/down + home + end keys would be more useful imo.)\n\nI didn't find much info about the keys online so here goes: one changes the \"power mode\" (3 modes: battery, balanced, perf) and is fairly useful because the cpu has both P and E cores, so (amongst other things) it gives some control over which set of cores you want to be using. Discovered this by running hwinfo whilst changing the power mode.\n\nThe next one changes the \"audio mode\" and is totally pointless, the machine has great sound whatever mode its in. The third changes \"eyecare mode\" and is a slightly useful to me - I have f.lux on constantly filtering blue light, and this key then acts as a toggle to add some extra strength to the filter on top of what f.lux does. The fourth key is configurable, I set it to open my most-used application.",
  "hello there, thanks for this comparison. I'm currently deciding between these two. May I know if you have the 2025 gen 10 for the Yoga? Do you see any screen door effect on the Yoga?

  "Yes, the gen 10 (gen 9 does not have lunar lake). I did not see a screen door effect on either the omnibook or the 9i with 2.8K. Imo the 9i 2.8K has the better screen, but I would have happily had either screen.",

  "Can HP Elitebook Ultra G1i 14” be considered a worthy competitor to Thinkpad x9 14\" or Carbon X1 Gen 13, or are HP laptops still not in the same league? Hey everyone,\n\nI'm looking to upgrade my current Thinkpad Carbon X1 Gen 5 and wanted to get your thoughts on whether [HP Elitebook Ultra G1i 14](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-elitebook-ultra-g1i-14-inch-notebook-next-gen-ai-pc-wolf-pro-security-edition-p-b69ytua-aba-1#techSpecs)” could be a solid alternative to Thinkpad x9 14\" or Carbon X1 Gen 13, or are HP laptops still not up to par?\n\n**Build quality** is very important to me, beyond just basic reliability. Also, the **keyboard**, **touchpad**, and **screen** need to be \"very good+\" to \"excellent\". I understand that the keyboard of any HP laptop won't be at the level of a Thinkpad keyboard, but it still needs to be really good (definitely better than Macbook keyboards).\n\nIt is worth noting that my last experience with HP's laptops was about 15 years ago, and it was honestly terrible..\n\nI'm not looking to dive into performance comparisons or nitpick small details right now. I just want to understand if HP have genuinely improved over the past 15 years to the point where the Elitebook series (and particularly the HP Elitebook Ultra G1i 14” laptop) is truly at the level of the Thinkpad series (and specifically the Thinkpad x9 14\" or the Carbon X1 Gen 13).\n\nI'll note that I saw one review of HP Elitebook Ultra G1i on [Notebookcheck.net](https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-EliteBook-Ultra-G1i-14-laptop-review-HP-s-new-business-flagship-is-a-great-total-package.984955.0.html), which was overall quite good, and another review here on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1izv3v7/hp_elitebook_ultra_g1i_full_review), which was somewhat lukewarm, but not negative in a way that would rule out this laptop.\n\np.s. the machine will be running Linux.\n\nWould love to hear your opinions and recommendations :)\n\nThanks in advance.",

  "Confused about which laptop to buy Hi everyone\n\nI am an engineering grad student and I want to buy a windows laptop for my work ( mostly ). but I keep getting more confused about which laptop to buy. My first choice was the Asus Zenbook 14, which I read multiple negative reviews of it's bad performance and some motherboard issues. My other candidate was some Lenovo Thinkpad Carbon( which is expensive ) Thinkpad P or T series, or Yoga 7i, which I read they also have some quality issues as the are made in China ( I just read the reviews, I never had a lenovo before). Then I found HP x360 2024 amazing due to its portability and use of newest gen of Intel chip, and guess what? when I searched its name, there was an essay of why these specific HP laptops are bad and have issues ( the post was from someone who claimed to be a former HP tech guy).\n\nIn conclusion, I want to buy a Laptop which is \n\n1. portable ( I have to carry it around everywhere, so the charger brick's weight also counts)\n2. Have good performance ( I use softwares for rendering and calculation, like heavy matlab tasks), so the RAM is also important. ( having the option to upgrade the device would be great )\n3. I am a bit concerned about the PWM of displays and it made me hesitate about buying an OLED panel )\n4. The battery life is also a thing, but not as important as the fan noise ( imagine being in a meeting and your laptop is louder than your supervisor )\n5. I have zero to no knowledge about the integrated graphics, but I heard the for an OLED panel its better to have a dedicated graphics. also for rendering I think dedicated graphics are better as you can assign a task to specific GPU core.\n\nRight now I am using an old Asus ROG from 6 years ago, and Its finally the time for retiring the old soldier.\n\nMy candidates for laptops are as mentioned:\n\n1. HP specter x360 (2024)\n2. Ideapad pro 5i\n3. Asus Zenbook 14 or 14pro\n4. Lenovo Yoga 7i (2024)\n5. Asus Zypherus g14 (2024 or 2023, I still don't know)\n6.

This is gonna be my laptop for college, I bought a Zephyrus G15 (yes you read that right, yes I'm downgrading), and I think the battery is so bad it's actually defective. I'm returning it, because my plan was to use the G15 as everything, and I was going to sell my desktop of equivalent power. After hiccups and loud fan noises, I'm not doing that.\n\nSo after a while of searching less expensive laptops, I found that. The only problem is that there are 3 reviews of this laptop, 2 say it's great, not very much detail, and the other one (which is on amazon) says the camera was defective.\n\nIs this a gamble worth taking? It's pretty comparable to the Slim 7 with 4000 series ryzen, and that seemed good according to the one review i've watched, and there's also the pro model.\n\nPro model: [https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Slim-Pro-Laptop/dp/B09MC3ZVNW](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Slim-Pro-Laptop/dp/B09MC3ZVNW)\n\nThis thing has a better display, better cpu, but less ports for some reason, also 240 dollars more. Do you think that's worth it?",
  "You're not \"downgrading\", they are different class of laptops. Zephyrus G15 is \"performance laptop\", the other two are \"ultrabooks\". If you want, you can spend way more than the price G15 on a very premium ultrabook.\n\nSince you're keeping the desktop, get an ultrabook. Idk what your budget is but neither Lenovo laptops you linked are good options.",
  "May I ask why you think they are bad options? They seem to be good price to performance and they don't have a fatal flaw like most other laptops, examples: bad wifi, bad audio, crappy materials, etc.\n\nDo you have any opinions on samsung's laptops? They seem to be alright",
  "They are both last year's laptops with subpar hardware. Samsung has bad keyboard and build quality, if you are looking at Galaxy books.",

  "Help to choose a used Dell/Thinkpad laptop from a short list Dear computer experts,\n\nPlease help to choose a used laptop for photo editing, light (YouTube) video editing, coding and general use.\n\nThe laptop ideally should have an option for a docking station for the home setup and not be completely rubbish for working on battery. I like the durability and aesthetics of Dell and IBM/Lenovo, especially business series, so I'd like to stick to these.\n\nThe local craigslist gives me these options:\n\n[What would be the best option? My ideal specs are in the top line.](https://preview.redd.it/sh5042jxphu71.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=537e350d410b8e45d3b7a5ca3dcddc66711f1498)\n\nI am getting lost in data comparing CPUs and GPUs and the real life performances of the PCs on this top 10. Not sure if older, but more top tier chip is better than newer, but maybe weaker one. I also know nothing of compatibility of Intel vs AMD with different Windows software. Also, don't know if touchscreen would be a super handy feature or just a battery draining gimmick.\n\nMy preference is currently for the ones with discrete GPUs, especially #1, 2, 3, 7. At the same time, some reviews on the laptops with integrated GPUs demonstrate that multimedia work can be done on those too. #2 seems almost perfect, save for the need to upgrade RAM and storage (means extra costs).\n\nThanks for your time and consideration!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. currently working on a 2007 Dell Latitude D630 - still does it for general use, but can't even play 720p videos on YouTube, let alone do any multimedia work. Also use Thinkpad T14s for (office) work, which I hear is not suitable for multimedia (and is beyond my budget).",
  "I would ask you what's your budget? Because all of the laptops are old. I think you could do better with specs of a laptop other places for the prices you are showing us.\n\nIf I had to pick from the list I would pick #4 because it has the newest  CPU with a workstation graphics card and 16Gb of ram.",
  "The budget is eur 700 max, ideally less than 500.\n\nI think the higher prices here have to do with the brands - I saw better/newer HPs, Acers, etc. for less. But in my experience, they don't last as long and generally are built worse. Would not buy a used one of these.\n\n#4 is beyond my budget, to be fair. I'd be fine with an older/cheaper machine that could do light multimedia work.",

  "HUAWEI MateBook 13 i7 2020 vs the LENOVO IdeaPad 5 15 AMD RYZEN 5 4500/4700U Hi hope everyone is safe during these dodgy times!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNew here and really in need of some advice as I don't really know too much about computers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm looking to buy a new laptop this week and have been looking at the HUAWEI MateBook 13 i7 2020 and the LENOVO IdeaPad 5 15 AMD RYZEN 5 4500/4700U. Both are relatively new so not too many reviews or much info online about them currently that I could find. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can get both laptops with 16gb RAM however the HUAWEI comes to £1099 and the LENOVO just £670 with RYZEN 5 4500 or £740 with RYZEN 5 4700. The HUAWEI comes with 512gb SSD whereas currently can only get 256gb SSD but with an additional 1TB HDD on the LENOVO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other factors are HUAWEI is touchscreen (which I doubt i'd use too frequently) not sure whether LENOVO is (confusing website!). Also the HUAWEI comes with a mouse, backpack and bluetooth earphones worth over £100 which makes it more appealing as I am looking to get some earphones. But the price gap of at least £300 makes me think the HUAWEI has to be better technically to warrant that price?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo please if someone could provide some advice on which would be better for me I would be very grateful. I would be mostly using the laptop for creative uses mainly music production on Ableton but also will probably use Photoshop and some video editing software if possible. Additionally will be doing the regular browsing, creating documents etc and the option to do some gaming would be nice but not overly fussed about any seriously demanding games.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the links to the products:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHUAWEI:  \\[[https://consumer.huawei.com/uk/laptops/matebook-13-2020/buy/](https://consumer.huawei.com/uk/laptops/matebook-13-2020/buy/)\\]([https://consumer.huawei.com/uk/laptops/matebook-13-2020/buy/](https://consumer.huawei.com/uk/laptops/matebook-13-2020/buy/)) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLENOVO:  \\[[https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/IdeaPad-5-15ARE05/p/81YQCTO1WWENGB1](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/IdeaPad-5-15ARE05/p/81YQCTO1WWENGB1)\\]([https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/IdeaPad-5-15ARE05/p/81YQCTO1WWENGB1](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/IdeaPad-5-15ARE05/p/81YQCTO1WWENGB1)) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance for your advice :)",

  "Desperate Canadian asking for help (casual gaming+college, CAD$1300-1400) Hello guys. I have picked a short list of budget gaming/college laptops after research, and can you guys help me making a decision? I play games that are not very demanding but also AAA games occasionally. I use heavy duty programmes not that often. I am able to carry big bags all around but battery life is important as well. \n(The following price is after deduction and shipping. Copied from another post of mine in r/SuggestALaptop)\n1. Acer Nitro 5 CAD$1250\nhttps://www.amazon.ca/Acer-Gaming-Laptop-i7-7300HQ-Windows/dp/B071JLXH2G?th=1\ni7-7700hq, 1050ti, 8gb ram, 512gb ssd, FHD IPS. Other specs unknown. This laptop is very new and doesn't have a review yet. But I think it has superb specs.\n\n2.Dell Inspiron 7567 CAD$1200\nhttp://www.dell.com/en-ca/member/shop/productdetails/inspiron-15-7567-laptop/ni157567_ftsb_s512e\ni7-7700hq, 1050ti, 8gb ram, 1TB 5400rpm w 8gb cache, FHD TN (Unfortunately, all Canadian Inspirons are TN screen. Ah, capitalists) Also a nice laptop with unrivalled battery life but the TN panel is a significant defect.\n\n3.

I am not a hard-core gamer but maybe I will occasionally have some AAA games.\nI am really interested in No.1 (Acer Nitro 5), but I am afraid that it isn't as good as advertised due to lack of reviews. Should I wait for a moment or buy now to avoid possible rise in price? It that worthy?\nIf I live in US, then Inspiron 7567 will be a no brainer. But the TN panel is, eh, undesired. It would cost me $200 to change a screen.  \nFinally, is there a model that is super fascinating that costs CAD$1300-1400? I didn't looked into that range much.\nThank you very much! \n",
  "The IPS screen on the 7567 is a game changer in the US - really sucks that you can't buy it in Canada. I'd recommend the other laptops. Maybe consider the Acer Helios 300 (GTX 1060 at just over $1000 USD) if it's the same price in Canada.  ",
  "Dont buy Lenovo you will regret it, they ship all their laptops with defects, mine and 1000 people.more who bought 510 yisk have defect touchpads",
  "Switch the TN panel in the 7567 for $60. It's much more powerful and very easy to switch.",
  "1999 CAD. Sad :(",
  "I don't know about the local retailers in Canada - if you're only able to shop online, try looking for deal websites or subreddits. Maybe consider ship by proxy services if you're desperate enough.",
  "Yeah... It's Amazon, and I believe it's the only place that sells Helios. Btw for Lenovo Y520, for casual gaming like OW, WOT or sth like that, would a i5-7300HQ works better than i7-7700HQ? If we take battery life into account, is i7 ($135 difference) that important?",

  "ThinkPad E Series? I'm thinking to buy this ThinkPad, but the reviews suggests that there are many problems with it, with some people saying the battery life is not good. \nBattery was the main issue for which i was thinking to buy this laptop, I'll be doing no high end stuff, just normal use as a college student.\nShould I still consider it or there are other good options in this range ( <50k ) with a decent battery life ( 5-8 hrs )\nHoping for more answers from ThinkPad owners.",
  "Battery is fine, max 8-9h which means around 6-7h in practical use.\n\nIn general the biggest weakness for the Thinkpad E is the screen. I hear the one on the 16\" is not as bad as the 14\" and it's alright if your requirements are not high, but it's not suitable for any kind of graphical work.",
  "What about performance and all, for a normal college student ?\nI read some ppl complaining that E series is worst and one should never buy it.",

  "Lenovo thinkpad E470 review! Just got this stunner of a thinkpad for $1000 CAD! Had for about a month so I decided to write a review as there are not many online.\n\n\n\nSPECS:\n\n\n-i7-7500U processor (3.4GHz turbo) with Intel 620 graphics\n\n\n-Geforce 940MX GPU (2GB DDR3)\n\n\n-8GB RAM (DDR4)\n\n\n-256GB OPAL2 compatible SSD\n\n\n-Intel 8264AC Wifi card\n\n\n-14 inch 1920x1080 IPS display (matte)\n\n\nI found this system to be quite nippy and responsive. I didn't expect Crysis at 60FPS ultra 1080p. Nor did I expect 75 degrees average temps in heavy loads! Cooling was good enough for me to overclock by a touch and still got 77 degree temps on average.\n\n\nCPU and GPU is enough for any light game at 1080p and medium settings. Harder games require lower resolution but still playable. Games like rocket league and CS:GO run well enough for casual play. Don't expect much, but its much better than integrated graphics by a long shot.\n\n\n\nBUILD QUALITY\n\n\nThe reason I bought Lenovo, the EPIC build quality. This is a $600 CAD laptop that is specced out, but still the same chassis as the $600 model...\n\n\nIts remarkable. Almost NO flex on the chassis and keyboard are. Absolutely no flex if you don't deliberately look for it. Low screen flex and a solid hinge make this feel premium, even though it is an entry-level model. \n\n\nKeyboard is a legend... No words can express how good this feels to type with. I got my blackwidow TE sitting in front of me, for my desktop PC. Yet I'm writing this review on the E470... Its good travel mixed with tactile feel, low/no flex... Words can't describe the feeling but my 101 WPM average on typeracer can!\n\n\nTHE LAYOUT! Worried about some weird layouts and key locations, there is none of that. The keys are FULLY spaced, no tiny keys on this keyboard. Big arrow keys with dedicated page up/down keys make navigation a breeze...\n\n\nSPEAKING of navigation, the trackpoint is on point here... Sorry for puns but the trackpoint is good for quick navigation in word files or browsers. I use it extensively in place of a mouse for coding and enjoy how seamless it really is. Accuracy and speed are good, although practice is needed. The buttons underneath is unothadox but loved. Kinda mushy buttons on the touchpad but deep travel and no wobble. The position is great for typing long series of text (Like this review)\n\n\nThe touchpad is good, not great but not bad. It kinda skips to the side if i click occasionally but gestures and scrolling are on point. The clicks get stiffer the higher up you get, annoying but standard. The size is decent but could be taller and wider. The palm rejection is good, but rarely is needed due to its smaller size. \n\n\nThe screen is good. Solid resolution of 1080p. Bright enough with matte display for outdoor use. Colors are a little weak but if you are not a hardcore designer or photoshop warrior, it won't be noticed. Scaling is bad out of the box and needed a couple minutes to get right. Overall not bad for the price.\n\n\nIO is also decent. Learn from this thing apple! 3 USB ports (1 always on 3.0, 1 3.0 and 1 2.0), HDMI (1.4), ethernet, combo jack and SD card reader. Good enough for a screen (also the graphics card helps as you can actually use external high res screens), a mouse (though trackpoint is good), external hard drive/USB. Power input is solid, does not take much force to pull out and the brick is pretty small. Charges VERY quickly, perfect for those on the go!\n\n\nSpeakers are good, a little lacking in bass but enough for watching youtube videos and movies. The indluded dolby audio system is quite capable of sounding great, requirigng no manual tuning.\n\n\n \nBATTERY LIFE/POWER\n\n\nI tweaked many settings around until I got the perfect configuration. Standard battery life is about 8 hours doing web stuff with no GPU, WiFi on, bluetooth on and about 60% brightness. With full load, battery is about 2 hours. Not bad at all! With undervolting and underclocking, I can manage 9 and a half hours of general use. When gaming the system overclocks to about 3.4GHz with NO thermal throttling, GPU is a toasty 80 degrees. \n\n\nNoise is pretty quite. On normal web usage, I hear nothing. SSD also helps this sound like a stealth fighter. When gaming, if you have a headset on, you won't hear this at all. There is only one cooling fan... It gets a little loud. Heat is not bad with 75-degree averages when under loads. The surface is warm but never too hot to touch. \n\n\n\nSOFTWARE\n\n\nHappy to report not much bloatware. Macafee trail run(BOOO!) can be removed easy. The included Lenovo apps SHOULD count as bloatware... But are actually quite useful! \n\n\nTL;DR: Great build quality, specs and value for the price. Lack of Thunderbold 3/Type C is a big con for many. The fit and finish is above and beyond expectations. The keyboard alone would be a selling point. Decent battery life. Decent screen. ",

  "Wow they still work\n\nThis is some sort of leaked company code? Will give it a shot",
  "Thanks for the help. When I configure the 470 I don't see 940MX as an upgrade option?\n\nEdit: oh the upgrade to i7 includes the 940MX wow",
  "Not leaked ;) Got a buddy who works for Lenovo and this is more of a publicity and reputation all thing. Good rep for the company and they still turn a profit. I think the E470 costs like $300 to make or something around that",
  "Yep! It is about twice as fast as the closest IGPU and be activated or deactivated on the fly for battery life or performance",
  "Lenovo Thinkpad T-series equivalent? Dell Latitude 5000? Milspec or not? Would it be correct to say that the Dell Latitude 5000 series would be the equivalent of the T480, while the Latitude 7000 series would be equivalent of the T480s? I've been looking at the T- and X-series, but I've been disappointed at the configuration limitations and QC issues. I was uncertain about my config and cancelled my order, though if there's another a 40%+ off sale, I think I might just get an X1C6 anyways.\n\nHowever, I'm being tempted by the deal on a loaded Dell Latitude 5491, though I'm only considering the i7 Latitudes in the first place since TB3 is limited to those (more annoying configuration limitations). It's CAD$1889 (US$1435) for the pre-baked i7-8850H model, but there are barely any reviews or info about the new Dell Latitudes. I'm most interested about their build quality as specs don't really matter for my intended use. Can I drop it (accidentally of course) and not worry about the chassis breaking?\n\nHeck, I still think the X1C6 is the perfect choice for me provided some of the CTO options make more sense (i.e. it costs ~$300 to upgrade to the i7 while it costs ~$150 to do the same on the T480s, and this is only relevant for me because the 16GB RAM is locked to the i7).",
  "T series is equivalent to 7000 series and HP Elitebook 800 series. \nT480s is just the slimmer version of the T480 - not necessary better build quality. \n\nYes u can drop the Latitude 5000 series, same as the ThinkPad L-series. But 'dropping' can obviously involve a lot of different things - so noone will give u any promises.  ",
  "Is this computer good? Hi, I’ve never owned a laptop before and was looking into buying one for university, I wanted to know whether or not this would be a good laptop that would last me a good 4-5 years, it looks like it has good specifications (ram and processor) but I’m a little suspicious due to the low price, please give me advice 🙏🙏🙏. Also if anyone has this laptop I wanted to know is the fan loud? Does the battery drain quickly? How long have you had it and how much longer do you think it’s gonna last? Thank you!!\n",
  "If you want a laptop that will last you need to look for used business grade laptops.",
  "not really intel gpu's are pretty bad and an I5 isn't great if anything the price is far to high",
  "Might have good specifications but consumer model HP laptops are known to have build quality issues... If you are looking for new devices only and you're on a budget then it's fine. If you are open to refurbished get an Elitebook 845 g10 or Elitebook 840g10... Another option is a firefly g11 which is also under 700$ refurbished.",
  "Hey, What do you intend to use your laptop for? because that is the thing that will decide whether this laptop is a good fit for you. What course are you doin at uni? do they expect you to run any special programs on it? what will you use your laptop for outside of school? etc",
  "specs are reasonably good. certainly good enough for everyday tasks. price seems a little high, but i'm not sure which currency it is. build quality may seem ok at first, but consumer level laptops like these are well known for having problems with the hinges after a while. there are probably better options out there.",
  "get a thinkpad even if it is e series",
  "What does business grade mean? Thank you!",
  "Really? I thought i5 was pretty high I was considering i3, what would be a suitable processor in your opinion? Thank you!",
  "What do you mean by build quality issues? Like it can break easily? Thank you!",
  "Honestly my university works mostly entails writing papers or essays and I don’t really game but I probably would watch YouTube videos/stream on it but to be honest a lot of people have mentioned that the hinges and overall build is really fragile and I really don’t want to risk breaking it so I think I’ll leave this one behind for now",
  "I’ll definitely look into something else then thank you!!",
  "It means it was made to be sold to companies, these laptops are meant to travel very often and thus are made much more durable, especially since companies buy a large number of them at a time so it's harder to scam them into paying a premium for cheap crap.",
  "no I3 is not great the computer is the image is fine for your needs but you could get one for cheaper refurbished or maybe from a local seller desktop's are always cheaper for more performance but if you need to move it around use a laptop",
  "Yes, weak hinges, the mounts are usually a combination of metal/plastic that tends to fail over time. You'll also have tons of flex on the keyboard, and most likely terrible screen quality.\n\nYou can probably take care of the computer and open it carefully from the middle or using both hands to prevent hinge failure... But I'd say the difference in quality is substantial",
  "Ohhhh okay thank you!! Also how would I know if something is business grade? Is it like a label or does it entail certain specs?",
  "Okay thank you!",
  "Okay thank you!!",
  "It's not something that is specifically stated anywhere in the laptop afaik, the only way is to look it up on google, aka it's gonna be a pain in the ass.

  "What's your budget? Most things from hp are a scam, I'd be looking on your local used marketplace for things like older thinkpads. If you want windows 11 without any maintenance difficulty you'll want an 8th gen or higher intel, 3000 seriea or above for ryzen, otherwise you can just bypass the requirements and get rid of some telemetry with rufus, although you'll need to check for updates manually, and install the optional updates as those are the device specific drivers. I would not recommend anything with less than 8gbs of ram, unless it's expandable, then you'll also need to get the extra sodimm stick.",

  "Nothing to do with'windows - but rather 'consumer' grade v. business build quality\n\nMost people buy consumer grade laptops that are essentially built to cost (as the manufacturer makes most of the money off the initial sale) - the whole strategy is to make the laptop lasts just so slightly longer than the warranty, after which if it breaks = extra $$$ for a new sale\n\nBusiness laptops on the other hand are built to last - as companies often pay (ridiculous money) for multi-year servicing plans on top of the initial purchase - so if the laptop breaks during this period, it actually costs the manufacturer money to repair/replace it\n\nThe extra cost of better build qualtiy (in terms of materials and often cheaper labour) up front is much less than having to pay for the man-hours of on-site support, skilled labour (often in a western country) and courier fees when trying to fix any problems later\n\nThere is a reason why thinkpads / elitebooks have a cult following - and many 2nd hand business laptops often out last the majority of consumer laptops sold new",

They don't excel anywhere but also have few drawbacks.\n\nLenovo is good.",
  "If you want a slimmer, nicer T14, then you may want to consider the T14s. It's not a huge difference from the regular T14, but a little bit slimmer and lighter and from more expensive materials.\n\nI recently got a T14s for 1200 €, and the catch here was that I bought an older generation on a good sale. The latest generation T14s tends to be closer to 2000 €.\n\nI'm partial to ThinkPads in general, but I think they are excellent laptops with one of the best keyboards even on the latest models.

(That doesn't apply equally across thinkpad lines, but T series is easy, T14 gen 1 is 2020.)\n\nAnyhow, 16GB, 512GB 10th i5 is $150-250 used excellent condition, minor wear.

It's a higher performance workstation, but built on the X1 Carbon Extreme chassis vs the T14 chassis. \n\nGoing down in build quality, the L series also has full slots vs soldered. The T14 gen 5 has two slots as well, but previous generations only had one slot and one soldered RAM module.",

I'm especially disappointed that they did away with an ethernet port entirely on a machine that's supposed to be a workstation. (Makes perfect sense, do away with the most common attachment we have available for network access)\n\nIf Lenovo brought out a version with 2.5mm mechanical key travel and a centered, reasonably sized touchpad, with the trackpoint retained and 3rd mouse button, they'd sell it on that alone, but add back every modern port we use and a few less modern ports for backwards compatibility, and they'd be golden. \n\nStick to 2 drives and a 3rd that can be an adapter or a drive, then 4 RAM slots, and offer upgraded motherboards every 2 years with new processor and GPU, for 30% of the cost of the laptop, and they'd be heroes. \n\nI thought that was gonna be Framework, but no.

Laptop I liked - ASUS Expertbook P1 [16GB RAM, i5 13420H processor at approx ₹46k]. Suggest me any other good laptop (under ₹50k) or if should I buy this one or a second hand Macbook.\n\nThanks !!!\n\n\n**Original long Post :**\n\nHello Guys !!!\n\nI'll be joining college this year in a branch related to Computer/Software Engineering. \n\nAs a student, my requirements are quite simple :\n\n- coding and learning\n- multimedia and others\n- casual gaming (not that important)\n\nFor this, I've decided to buy a new laptop during the sale period (in India) as my old one is quite slow and I won't need it now.\n\nSo, I thought of this laptop by ASUS called as the ASUS Expertbook P1 (images are attached) and it has the following specifications:\n\n- intel i5-13420H 13th gen processor\n- 16 GB DDR5 RAM (upgradable upto 64GB)\n- 512GB 4th gen SSD (2 slots are available)\n- 15.6 inch Full HD 60Hz + 300 nits display\n- USB C charging with 50Wh 3 cell battery\n- full length keyboard with fingerprint sensor\n- US military grade certification \n- Windows 11 + Windows OFFICE 2024 \n- approx ₹46k price during Flipkart sale (goes lower with other offers)\n\nOFFICIAL LINK : https://dl.flipkart.com/s/849e_suuuN\n\n\nSo, that's it. \n\nCurrently, I am confused if I should buy this one or other one or a second hand Macbook.\n\nI read some reviews of this ASUS Laptop and others in general and the ppl said that the company has a poor customer service, bad laptops, bad battery, etc.\n\nI am not believing these things but I wanna know the truth, whatever it may be. Also, fyi I have 2 ASUS stores near my locality so customer service is not quite a issue ig.\n\nWrt this laptop - the reviews were quite good but the only negative thing was about the low battery backup of around 4 hours (obvious because it has an \"H\" series processor).\n\n\n\nIf I were be able to buy other laptop, this is what I'd looked for :\n\n- min 16GB RAM (DDR5 and upgradable is good)\n- min 512GB SSD (better if upgradable)\n- Windows 11\n- min i5 11th gen or equivalent processor\n- price shoukd be under ₹50k (approx $650)\n\nIf you have any other suggestions, please let me know. \n\nThanks in advance !!!",

  "Need a laptop for work! Deciding between Acer Aspire 5, Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 and Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge I work mostly from home and I have an iMac which I use 90% of the time. I had an iMac air (from 2016) which I took to meetings, did presentations with and worked on whenever I wasn’t at my desk. My laptop recently died and I want to replace it. I don’t have the budget to replace it with another iMac laptop, so I’m looking at different options. I need it to use Microsoft Office, Teams calls, OneDrive, downloading and uploading videos, occasional photo or video editing (I do most of this on my desktop compute but it would be nice to have a backup), presentations, AirTable.

  "swift go 14 sfg14-72-53bp (125H, OLED) UPDATE: 4 months later. i love love love it. it's perfect for me. a 14\" MBP that can do everything that i could ever imagine. no problems thus far. :fingers\\_crossed:\n\n[https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72-53bp](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72-53bp)\n\ni was writing a comment on [Im planning on getting the Acer Swift Go 14 with the oled screen... is this a good idea? : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1dh9jne/im_planning_on_getting_the_acer_swift_go_14_with/) and basically ended up writing a review, so:\n\nI just got the 125H version (mis-posted as 135H) off eBay for $550 \"like new\"/\"open box\". It's incredible, especially when coming from a limiting chromebook and an even more limiting iPad mini, lol! The 125H goes for $850 and the 155H goes for $1000 on the Acer US store.\n\nof note: the older [Acer Swift X 13500H RTX 3050 version](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-x-14-laptop-sfx14-71g-5911) (an older *non-touch* IPS screen) is going for $800 new! That's a significantly better gpu, but likely more power-hungry and perhaps limited by the 65w battery and even 100w charger, but who knows: those AMD ryzens seem to do way better than the intels of their time. Highly likely to find one going for a low price compared to bigger names. The next jump is at $1300 for a new swift go 14\" 155H rtx 4050.\n\nhere's a quick useful video review about it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3I3q48674&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3I3q48674&t=180s)\n\nmajor notes:\n\n* **the version with the OLED screen does not have touch input.** I found this out the hard way. :( I guess i assumed that the swift's \"go\" series was like \"flipbook\" and \"spin\", in that the touch-screen is it's main feature, without the flipping/spinning part. I was wrong. (the 155H version has touch-screen: [SFG14-72T-71QF](https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-go-14-laptop-sfg14-72t-71qf) along with a 16\" version. Look for the icon with a finger pointing.)\n\nmajor cons:\n\n* the battery life is lower compared to other ultrabooks, maybe 6-10 hours vs 10-14 hours zenbook, perhaps due to the 65w vs 75w battery(?). I can't say yet, and maybe windows (and it's bloatware) is still doing something, but i got 10 hours on my first three charges, draining at \\~10%/hour; But i also always use minimum brightness, and just had the normal 30 tabs open (edge, most tabs sleeping) with music playing. Conversely, perhaps because it has a smaller battery, it charges very very quickly: an hour or so (with the given charger). It's also nice that usb-c was standardized for charging, though i wished the usb-c cable would detach from the power block... A minor gripe. After the first few drains, i've kept the laptop charged, and used some pre-installed Acer program to limit charging when plugged-in (to 80%, no choice). This really is it's only major con.\n* the OLED is glossy. so glossy you can see a deep, deep, and rich reflection of yourself. It's like looking into a dark mass of water. It raises self-awareness and horror :cold\\_face:\n\nproblems likely similar to other ultrabooks, and other notes:\n\n* fan noise, and heat. when it speeds up, it's clearly audible in a quiet bedroom when it starts up. it can start with very little computering ([the zenbook got panned in a review for being worse](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Zenbook-14-OLED-review-The-1-2-kg-subnotebook-with-120-Hz-OLED-and-Core-Ultra-7.805236.0.html)), then it goes back to silent mode, and thankfully, *stays* silent. And when it's silent, it's *absolutely* silent! It's apparently not louder than it's competitors tho?? sounds fine to me... *Thank goodness!* Along with fan noise, it can get a little warm at the palms. I think this happened during the beginning of it charging. Thankfully, the aluminum(?) case ensures it cools down quickly, and keeps it cool. (this is my portable-desktop-laptop, wherein i plan to use a separate mechanical keyboard most of the time anyway). However, when it's not charging, it seems to stay quiet 'n cool, which is the most important time.\n* the speakers are bass-less, but the amp is surprisingly incredible(!!).. but then again, i've never heard good laptop speakers in my life. Zero bass, which i'm okay with, as i'm a dreamy-pop treble music person, but just say no to lo-fi/city-pop. It's interesting to hear bass guitars without the bass.. It reminds me of my old purple 'n gold ATH-AD700 headphones that i adore, but far worse mixing. The audio goes through some artificial spatial surround sound software: the mids seem to live recessed in the bottom center of the laptop (vocals), then are overtly forwarded to every direction / speaker in the artificial speaker system (piano), the highs are all over the place, moving from one part of the laptop to another; and the lows remind me of bad midi music. Your favorite music will *not* move you. You will however listen to your favorite music in a very different way.. Having said that, the speakers can get very loud, easily able to fill up a room(!!), and most importantly: beyerdynamic 300r 32ohm headphones sound great at a mere 10% volume!\n* the up and down arrow keys share a single key area. I use wasd for gaming, so it doesn't bother me. This also keeps the keyboard's shape to a neat rectangle.\n* the left modifier keys aren't big. they're the same size as the letter 'n number keys. The right modifier keys, however, are slightly wider. They had to do this to make space for the function key. UPDATE: i re-mapped/swapped left-control with left-alt, mac-style. much better. i'll likely re-map holding caps-lock to left-control too.\n* the keys feel only slightly better than my $40 samsung chromebook 4, which, now that i'm looking at it, surprisingly, has the big fat left modifier keys and complete arrow keys too! Not bad, that thing! (for programmers the tilde key and delete keys are nice to have, and nicely placed, as are the half-size function/special keys... tho, i'm scared of what bloatware the acer key will manifest..!) UPDATE: in retrospect, it's actually a great keyboard. I ordered a keychron k6, and those red keys are god awful. Seriously, who want's to press a key down for a one-half inch?? I've become used to the tiny distance of laptop keyboards..\n* the 14\" screen is a huge surprise coming from an 11.6\" chromebook (2.4\" is a lot!) and even the 13.3\" macbook, yet it's dimensions are only very slightly larger (<1\"). There's about an inch of empty space on both sides of the keyboard--I'm the sort of person who saw the 15\" Macbook and thought, *\"ugh, what is all that space for!?\"*, and didn't buy one until the 13\" came out. The massive OLED screen gets as close as you'd want to the edges--any closer, your fingerprints would smudge the beautiful screen when opening/closing it. As does the massive trackpad.\n* the bigger touchpad may cause more accidents. I haven't had enough experience, but thus far, it seems fine for my hands, for the most part. I did have had it click on random parts of this review i'm writing quite a few times.. but then again, i'm currently sitting at a bad angle. UPDATE: i love it. bigger is better. i must have gotten used to it, as i don't accidentally touch it anymore..\n* the ports are perfect for me, as i'm not updated on current technology: two thunderbolt(?, new to me), two usb--one on each side!!!, one hmdi, a headphone jack, an sd card reader, and a good ol' kensington lock, lol. I've never used a lock before, but have always found it intriguing . I feel the port choices are very old-school, like me. :) It might be possible for 4 displays for this chip...!? (note: smaller 13.3\" laptops can compromise on ports)\n* bloatware. after 20 years, this still exists. Why? McAfee still exists..?? I did however use the 1 year of 100GB dropbox. Could someone please ship me a usb flash drive or sd card so that i can re-install windows? ;(\n\nwith all the similar \"ultrabooks\" (Asus zenbook, Lenovo yoga, HP spectre, Dell xps 14, maybe even the lower-end Acer spin, Asus flipbook, Asus vivobook, HP pavilion plus, Dell inspiron plus, 'n so on), i felt it's pretty hard to decide on one, and just went with what good deals i found on eBay, and checked the review on notebookcheck, and double-checked that the specs are indeed \"ultra\" (weight, size, build quality--not plastic).\n\nit's direct local (to Taiwan) competition is the asus zenbook, and i actually think that's a better notebook. Better speakers, better keyboard (i prefer big keys over the macbook chiclet-style), betters looks (premium business ultrabook vs macbook clone), lighter (an insane 1.3kg), and most importantly a better battery (75w vs 65w, 12+ hours vs 8 in tests!), but, notebookcheck's review noted a fan noise problem, due to it having a single fan / heat-sink vs this Acer's double fan 'n heat-sink. The problem could just be a fluke, but def worth researching other users experiences about it. Beyond that single problem though, i def prefer the zenbook. However, if a macbook clone is what you're really into, this Acer is just that!: a 14\" Macbook Pro (possibly for half the price due to bad resale value)\n\ni personally chose the Intel ultra series for it's great games/power balance, and x64 architecture. I missed out on the entire AMD marathon. An older asus rog flow x13 (g14 doesn't have touch-screen), razer blade 14, or microsoft surface pro (intel ultra series, not the newer ARM arch models) would have been my top choices, if i were to accept something more used. The previous gen surfaces were way too expensive! But i'm super stoked with what i got for $550. Wow! Also, i love Taiwan (made in Taiwan <3), so Acer 'n Asus were actually my top choices (they do all the hard work of making everything, and are absolutely lovely people with an incredible culture to behold, so let them have all my monies!). Actually, i've been fond of the swift series laptops, particularly swift 3 series and 5 series, ever since that time i went to a physical store to test 'n compare laptops. They were by far the best deals in the \"budget\" range. They were all ultrabooks in my eyes, for a fraction of the price of one.\n\nthe OLED is stunning. Now there's absolutely no need for a Macbook for me. My last one was a late-201313\" MBP. Hello again, Windows. How i've missed you dearly. And oh my, how you've accepted Linux..?? I don't even need Linux anymore, and that's coming from Arch! Also, having done some programming, i can't justify the sufferings that Apple has made programmers go through over its reign. Microsoft has since made a big turn towards accepting open-source, linux, programmers, etc. Strange, but good... i hope.\n\nfor my personal needs, the lower-resolution IPS touch-screen would've been ideal, for both touch input and possibly better gaming performance (*does native resolution matter nowadays..?*). It is indeed a major bummer. However, i feel that without the the ability to swivel the screen around (\"convertible\"), it would've made an odd touch-screen experience anyway, quite different from tablets. Also very important to note, **there's quite a few touch-screen OLED notebooks--**[**including the zenbook**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/13wdvxm/oled_touchscreen_is_awful/)**--, that suffer from a grainy screen problem**--though, i don't know which exact models / year have this problem. So, in the end, i feel it was more of a blessing. Anyway, i'm hoping my next job will pay for a premium laptop. At the moment, if money were not a factor, i'd go for either the Asus rog flow x13 or dreamy z13. The z13 is all i've ever dreamed for, ever since the iPad came out. ;) ...but i've read that even the z13 suffers from a very low battery life. :/\n\nUPDATE: now that i've got OLED, i can't imagine ever going back.. o.o\n\nso, if i were to choose again, a \"new\" 2022 asus rog flow x13 ryzen 7940HS would have been my choice, and very very surprisingly, it's going for a mere \\~$800!! So, unless you find a deal like mine, you should just go for one of the best out there! Otherwise, this is an incredibly solid laptop for its price. It has also easily convinced me macbooks aren't worth it anymore, as it was a decade ago, even considering the newer ARM M-series. I'm a believer of Acer/Asus/Taiwan!",
  "Is the fan noise not that big of a deal? I plan to buy this same model, and will be using this inside my university's computer laboratory. And I don't want to distract others with the fan noise.",
  "I bought my Acer Swift Go 14 on September 28, featuring an Ultra 5 125H processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and a 90Hz OLED HDR display running Windows 11 (23H2). I got it for 60,000 INR after discounts, down from around 80K. My previous laptop was the ASUS FX504, which I used for 6 years.\n\n# Negatives:\n\n* Wi-Fi Speeds & Performance: The ASUS consistently outperforms the Acer in download speeds, and I occasionally feel a static sensation when touching the metal surface while charging.\n* Sharp Trackpad Edge & Heat During Charging: The trackpad edge is uncomfortable, and the right side gets hot while charging, making it tough to use on my lap.\n* Useless Copilot Key & Keyboard Backlight: I remapped the Copilot key to Ctrl using AutoHotKey, but the keyboard backlight turns off too quickly, which is frustrating.\n* AI Features & Webcam: The AI eye contact feature is poorly executed, and the wide-angle webcam captures too much of my surroundings.\n* Glossy Display: It's highly reflective, which isn't ideal for bright environments.\n\n# Positives:\n\n* Stunning Design & Trackpad: The laptop looks sleek, almost like a MacBook, and the massive trackpad is so good that I hardly use a mouse.\n* Solid Hinge & Great Keyboard: The hinge is easy to open with one hand and feels premium, while the keyboard is clicky and visually appealing.\n* Outstanding Display: It's bright and colorful, with excellent HDR for movies.\n* Useful AI Features & Decent Speakers: The AI background blurring and noise cancellation work well, and the speakers are good for a laptop.\n* Convenient Charging & Good I/O: I can use my phone's USB-C charger, and there are multiple USB ports and useful features.\n\n# Performance:\n\nWhile I haven't tested it with games or benchmarks yet, the Acer is significantly faster than my ASUS for everyday tasks. It handles multiple apps smoothly, even on battery.\n\n# Battery Life:\n\nYou can't expect stellar battery life with a high-resolution H-series processor. I got around 5 hours of SOT with regular use and 4 hours while looping a 4K movie. There are ways to extend battery life, but I prefer using it to its full potential since it stays on my desk most of the time.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nFor the price I paid, I believe I found the best laptop for my needs. I'm very satisfied overall. **For the full review, check out my post** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcerOfficial/comments/1g75rhv/new_acer_swift_go_14_ai_pcs_review/).

Oh also, if you actually need to use windows, i’m not sure if windows even runs on ARM..?? (see link). And what about all those games/apps made for x64 or even older 32-bit? You’d have to research into Mac’s emulation. I would hope the x64 emulation is good, as it takes time to transition cpu architectures.. I personally just wouldn’t want to bother with all of this, so it better be dang good! The intel Macs was a good time imo, having Mac and windows run natively via boot camp. ARM, i have no idea.

Forcing people to buy a Mac product just to deploy to it is insane to me (though surely there’s a service for that now..).

  "Apple has, by far, the easiest laptops to recommend. As someone who helps friends buy laptops, the most common request I get is a “good quality” option at the lowest price. Sometimes they mention screen size or specific Apps to run.\n\nCompanies like HP and Lenovo offer enticing entry-level laptops — often in the $250–$600 range. But here’s the issue: those cheap models always come with major compromises, such as bad hinges (the \"HP Laptop\" series classic), TN screens, and slow CPUs/GPUs.   \n  \nGuess what happens when someone buys such laptops? Yep, disappointment and associating the brand or Windows PCs with bad quality. Even if the company makes excellent options (HP's EliteBook/Lenovo's Thinkpad), they’re not the ones people tend to buy first.\n\nThis is why I always tell people to stay away from these low-end options and go for more premium ones, which typically start at around $800. In other words, to get a Windows laptop of \"good quality,\" **you're almost always spending a similar amount to a MacBook's entry price anyway**.\n\nThe difference is when I recommend a Windows laptop, I have to filter hundreds of bad laptops across confusing product lines. And even when picking a supposed premium option, when I watch reviews, I find a weird quirk such as trash speakers or high fan noise. Not to mention the battery life estimates that are never right. All this is confusing for me, someone who spends a lot of time reading about tech & laptops. I can only imagine how frustrating it is for the normal buyer!\n\nWith Apple, you skip that filtering step. You don’t need to figure out which model is “good enough.” You just pick based on size or processor, not quality. That simplicity and confidence is unmatched. Never had I recommended a MacBook and got a complaint about them.\n\nApple may seem to have a more expensive entry-level price, but it is the same as premium Windows laptops (and sometimes cheaper). They would rather sell you nothing than sell you a sub-par laptop.\n\nOfc Apple is not perfect. They are quite scummy with memory upgrades and right-to-repair. I'm just talking about their marketing philosophy which I find really consumer friendly. I personally prefer Windows laptops. ",
  "As long as you don’t care about gaming or engineering tools, yeah.",
  "This is biased and subtly rigged to favor Apple  --\n\n1. There are some solid PC laptops just at the $600 range.   Here's [one.](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Vivobook-Thunderbolt-Win11Home-Expander/dp/B0DPB6YWTS)  You imply that unless you're spending close to the entry level MacBook Air price, it's garbage.  Untrue.\n2. Using that link as a referent, you also imply similar pricing in spec.  Except it isn't.  That $609 laptop comes with 16GBs of RAM and 512SSD storage.  The MacBook Air equivalent of those specific specs is $1200.  That's twice the price.  So is --\n3. \\-- the extended warranty.  Four years of the Asus is $125.  Apple's is $280.\n4. \"when I watch reviews, I find a weird quirk such as trash speakers or high fan noise.\"  I appreciate this.  However, the entire PC industry doesn't need to de-quirk to challenge Apple.  A handful of challengers is all you need.  \"But Acer sucks!\"  Don't buy Acer then.\n\nYes, it takes more work to find which PCs are better products, which Apple exploits for their sales.  Give a choice of two product lines sure beats 50 product lines.\n\n*Ofc Apple is not perfect.*\n\nCorrect.  They have quirks too.  My problem is you're paying thru the eyeballs for their quirks.\n\n*I'm just talking about their marketing philosophy which I find really consumer friendly*\n\nInteresting.  At the last second you reframe your argument.  \"I'm just saying Apple is so consumer friendly.\"  **No you're not, lol.**  You're saying, \"Why waste money on quirky bothersome PCs when for a just a few more bucks (lie) you can get a Mac and skip all the fuss?\n\n*I personally prefer Windows laptops.*\n\nUh-huh.  Drawing a halo over your head in attempt to cleanse this drivel of bias ain't working.  Please tell us all the 'great' things Trump is doing and announce you're a Berniecrat.  I'm all ears.",
  "This is relatively true since the introduction of the Apple Silicon MX devices, within their price brackets. Previously this was not the case.\n\nAt lower budgets, non Apple devices are the only option.\n\nIf the user requires games or software that will not work under Crossover or Parallels, then Apple is not an option.",
  "Yeah definitely. I missed that point from my argument.",
  "1.The S14 is a fantastic laptop and shockingly affordable, but it seems like an exception. I haven’t found it in other markets. I still think $800 is the sweet spot for enthusiast-level performance and CNC build quality. I never said sub-$800 laptops are garbage, just that they typically lack \"good quality.\" If you only need something for Word or browsing, even a $250 laptop will be perfect.\n\nIf you don't care about anecdotes, ignore this: I recommended a ZenBook 14 i7 1360P to a friend, which everyone praised at the time. Its screen wobbled almost 2.5 cm without exaggeration, the speakers were blown out, and the aluminum build creaked like crazy. Probably a bad unit, yeah, but when we talked to ASUS, they told us the laptop is fine and we can't issue a replacement. This is what I'm talking about. Maybe this year's Zenbooks are better, but there is no consistency. I still have to make sure the laptop is without quirks before buying.  \n\n2.Yes, I do imply similar specs, and I explicitly mentioned Apple's scummy storage options as the exception. Even so, I frankly think other specs are much more important.\n\n3.That's a good point I haven't considered (even though I have bad experience with Asus' warranty. I will keep it short, but Asus is [not a company particularly known for their warranty](https://old.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/1dhy0m6/psa_if_you_ever_did_a_warranty_claim_with_asus/)). I still concede to your point though. \n\n4.I don't think you get what I'm saying. The PC industry has a LOT of extremely good laptops that are 100% worth the price. The problem is with the buying experience. You can't know just from the title if the laptop is of high quality. You have to wait for reviewers' opinions, and if it wasn't reviewed from a reputable source like Notebookcheck, you're out of luck. The solution is simple: just put out a product line that never has compromises like how Apple does. Very few companies do that: I really REALLY love HP's EliteBook and ZBook line; they've earned my trust, but that's after a lot of experience with them. I have yet to find similar \"worry-free\" product lines from other companies. \n\nI really appreciated your nuanced and informed take until you butchered my arguments and assumed bad intentions at the end. My argument is super clear, and I will repeat it again: **Apple is consumer-friendly for buyers because they give you a \"good quality\" line of laptops that you can trust. Other Windows companies can learn from that.** I can easily tell my friend right now to buy any modern MacBook and know they will have a flawless experience with the hardware. Can't do the same with PC companies. When did I say all Windows laptops are quirky?? How did I reframe my argument?\n\nYou last sentence is so frustrating because there is no winning if I you tell the truth or not. I have been using HP EliteBooks for the past 5 years and I wouldn't replace them for anything else. Do with that what you will. If you actually want to attack me personally, maybe first go through my comment history where I have tons of contributions recommending & researching Windows laptops?",
  "Yep, MacBooks are all-around premium laptops, which is a specific segment, albeit one with the most buyers. \n\nThey 100% can't compete with budget options or CUDA/gaming applications. That was a missed point in my argument.",
  "Need to choose between Yoga Slim 7i and ThinkPad X9 15 Hey everyone,\n\nI'm an engineering student looking to choose between two laptops, and I’d love your input. Here’s what’s important to me:\n\nThese are my two options -\n\n1.

I know OLED has better contrast and colors, but I’m concerned about burn-in over time. Thoughts?\n3. **Storage**: Yoga has 1TB storage vs 256GB on Thinkpad\n4. **Build Quality**: Yoga vs Thinkpad\n\n\n# My Use Case:\n\n* I won’t be gaming, but I’ll occasionally do light to moderate workloads involving programming and simulations.\n* Portability is a factor, so I’d like something that doesn’t weigh a ton or heat up too much.\n\nAny advice on which laptop or specs would be better for me? If you’ve had experience with these processors or display types, I’d love to hear your feedback!\n\nThanks in advance! 😊",
  "Burn in was solved many years ago, but the x9 is slightly thinner than the yoga slim, and it has less internal space for heat dissipation in general. Oled also kills battery, so the yoga slim will be better for you",
  "I'm in the same predicament of choice. \nBut my concern is the comparison between those two processors.\n\nMy multitask use:\n(not necessarily all at the same time) \nOften have many tabs open at a time, 10-20\nSpotify \nOnline textbooks \nEmails\nVideo calls, screen recording \nOne android emulator often open. \nResearch on chat gpt or perplexity \n\n\nI have a primary desktop at home.\n\nMy question is between the core ultra 7 of the slim and the core ultra 5 of the ThinkPad will the ThinkPad be a substantial let down in comparison in terms of future proofing or perhaps multitasking?\n\nWhich would you choose?\n\nThanks",
  "Based on Reviews, The X9 still manages a longer battery life even with the OLED courtesy of its larger internal battery than the Yoga.\n\n[RTINGS - ThinkPad X9](https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/lenovo/thinkpad-x9-15-aura-edition-2025)\n\n[RTINGS - Yoga Slim 7i](https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/lenovo/yoga-slim-7i-aura-edition-15-2024)",

  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget €2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years. As longevity is important, I believe performance is an important criteria. My current setup is an 8th gen Intel i5 Asus laptop (8/256) and a M4 Mac Mini (24/512) on the desk. I want to replace both of these items with a single Windows laptop and I'll sell the Mac. I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around €2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. €1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. €1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. €1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. €2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. €2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** €2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",

  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",

  "Also, unlike the ProArt you don't need to pay for a 4070 you said you wouldn't be using much. The 16:10 screen is also good for web development with it's bit of extra height. P1's are also pretty much the top of the Thinkpad scale, being workstation laptops and thus very solid. P1 gen 7 is also 17mm thick and 2kg so pretty portable.",

However, given the Acer's reputation on overheating and its  build, Im thinking twice if I should take a risk on Acer Swift 14 AI, given this is one of their latest premium models (released 2024). Acer also has a bigger discount and freebies so it feels a bit of too good to be true deal.\n\nShould i go for the well regarded Lenovo or take a risk on the newer Acer Swift?",

  "Options for general use + work Hello,\n\n  \nI'm looking for a laptop for general web browsing, but also would have to use it for work.\n\nAs for work, I need some basic office suits like document writings and also some programming/data analysis using Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy and scipy.\n\n  \nIt would be ideal that it would have a long battery life. I'm not interested in games.\n\n  \nI found some options that might fit my needs, although there are some notes that I may add further down below. These are my top 3 picks:\n\n  \n1. Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5\n\n* 13.3'' inch screen (100% sRGB)\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7735 HS\n* 16GB LPDDR5x-6400 RAM\n* 512GB SSD\n* Price: \\~ 940 USD\n\n2. Asus Vivobook 14\n\n* 14'' screen (45% NTSC)\n* Intel Core Ultra 5 225H\n* 16GB DDR5 on board (it doesn't specify the frequency)\n* 512 GB SSD\n* Price: \\~ 940 USD\n\n3. Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3\n\n* 14'' screen (45% NTSC)\n* Intel Core i5-13420H\n* 24GB DDR5-4800 MHz (8GB on board + 16GB SO-DIMM)\n* 512GB SSD\n* Price: \\~870 USD\n\n  \nSo, a few notes to be added. I was initially thinking of buying laptops with the U series intel CPUs. But could only find from past generations, at most 13th. By the way, the new Intel name scheme seems confusing to me. Why not keep the same nomenclature as before?!\n\n\n\nThe IdeaPad Slim 3 seems to me like a good option because of the increase in the RAM, even though the CPU is from 2 generations ago.\n\n\n\nI know the IdeaPad Slim 5 is also with a CPU from 2023, but I really like the idea of having a small and light laptop like this. I previously owned a heavy gaming laptop and it was horrible to carry it around everywhere. Looking for the opposite now, so this one looks like a good option. However, I'm also looking for long battery life, and I don't know how a HS CPU would affect this.\n\n  \nThe Asus has the most modern CPU, but I've seen a review where it states that the body, keyboard etc are not so good.\n\n  \nAt any rate, I would appreciate any comment on those options. Is the the new Ultra 5 worth it, even though the laptop itself is fragile and not good? Would the increase in RAM make the IdeaPad Slim 3 a better option on cost/benefit?",
  "All of those should be fine for your use cases. Personally I would choose number 3, because you could upgrade the RAM if you need to in future. Also for your programming are you going to be any machine learning tasks? If so, I might recommend getting a laptop with a GPU.",
  "Costco Laptop for Engineering College - Should I buy it? What about a Warranty? https://preview.redd.it/6qx5jw471icf1.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4a8638f02ba7545482c0a0757fa4af0fe10f914\n\nTL;DR -  Is this a good deal for an engineering student?\n\nI found [this](https://www.costco.com/asus-vivobook-flip-14-oled-touchscreen-copilot-pc---intel-evo-edition-powered-by-intel-core-ultra-7-256v-series-2-processor---windows-11---16gb-ram---1tb-ssd.product.4000362441.html) Asus Vivobook 2-in-1 on sale at Costco and I need some advice.\n\nFor context-\n\nI will be starting this fall majoring in engineering and double majoring in music (vocal performance). I already bought an Alienware Desktop that is strong enough to handle whatever software I'll need to throw at it, but I need a laptop / tablet that I can take with me to classes. Because I have a stronger desktop for my dorm, I don't need a laptop that is as strong - just one that somewhat versatile and will last for a few years (At least four, I hope).\n\nI was originally thinking of buying an iPad, per the suggestion of my brother, who just finished the program that I will soon be starting, but I thought that a Windows device would mesh a bit better with my  desktop. That made me consider a Surface Pro, but I decided against that because I would have had to buy an older model to avoid compatibility concerns with the newer ARM-based processors.\n\nSo I'm currently thinking of buying a 2-in-1 laptop. The one above, specifically\n\nThe pros, as I see them-\n\n* \\- It's on sale\n* \\-  Looking on line and comparing it to a Surface Pro 7 or 9, it seems I would have to spend $200-$400  more to get one that rivals the strength of this one.\n* \\- Costco has a 90 day full refund policy, so I could test software / strengths \n* \\- Touchscreen means I will be able to use it for notes & maybe sheet music (I'll be in choir)\n* \\- 70WHr Battery - Not the best, but it seems pretty solid from what I've seen\n* \\- It has more ports (1 x USB, 2 x USB-C, 1 x HDMI, 1 x Micro SD reader) than a surface pro or an iPad\n* \\-It's not that heavy - I was able to see it in store, and holding like I would a music binder it seemed quite manageable\n\nCons-\n\n* \\- It doesn't have a dedicated GPU (has intel arc integrated)\n* \\- It seems almost to good to be true\n\nI don't know about Asus as a brand, and I've never bought a pc from Costco before. As far as I can tell, this is a really good deal, which makes me suspect I'll get bit in the ass by something I'm not seeing.\n\nSo, any feedback on this laptop is appreciated, as are recommendations for others.\n\n  \nADDITIONALLY,\n\nCostco laptops come included with a 2 year warranty - 1 year through Asus, 1 year through All-State. My question for anyone with experience with these warranties is 1- How good are they? And 2- Should I pay $100 for an Additional 3 years through All-State. The additional warranty looks like it covers drops and spills, but I don't think it runs concurrently with the included plan, so there would be 5 years total. \n\n\\^-Am I right?",

I need something that is well..a laptop \n\nI would like something with some more power storage and memory. \n\nI do \n\nDrawing/Animating: 35%\n\n3D Modeling/Sculpting/Animation/Rendering: 45%\n\nVideo Editing/Production/: 10% \n\nPhoto Editing/Retouching: 10%\n\nThe applications I use on my PC that I want to use on my laptop. This is just a few for starters \n\n\nCSP\nAdobe Creative Suite\nAffinity Suite\nBlender\nZbrush \nDavinci Resolve (Davinki?)\nPixel Suite Pro\nSketch up \n\n\n\nI mainly game on my PC—I’ve been in the process of upgrading her but that’s for another day. And any games I would play on my laptop would be Incredibly light and non demanding.and if I play it would be probably emulation. \n\n\nMajority of my time is spent purely for creating and editing on the go. I don’t want to really be at my PC all day considering I NEED and WANT that sunlight. \n\nSo if you do have any recommendations please tell me:\n\nYour experience with the laptop \nIf you have a drawing tablet with your laptop what would it be. \nDo you regret anything about the laptop?\nHow long have you’ve had your laptop and is it still going? \nHow many laptops have you had over the years?\n\n\nLooking for all perspectives. Thank you! \n\n",
  "Getting a good laptop with a Ryzen 7 7730 or 8800 series or an Ultra 7 Intel chip have good integrated graphics. So, a HP Spectre, Asus Zenbook, Lenovo Thinkpad are good items.\n\nIf you needed a graphics card, the Lenovo Yoga 9 Pro has good reviews.",
  "Buying laptop, Which one should I go with? I reviewed few laptops and it came to these two. I need expandable memory (extra M.2 slot) as 512gb is too less. xoandable memory without extra M.2 slot is waste of money for me. I mostly need laptop for college (MBA) and watching movies, web series, etc. Budget is under INR 60K.",
  "Why does the AMD variant not show the RAM? It simply says SODIMM",
  "its 16 GB DDR5-4800MHz (SODIMM) for amd version",
  "I'd go for the AMD as it's ₹5k cheaper, the other specs looks pretty similar",
  "Thinkbook has Thunderbolt 4 port too not that I use it now but maybe for future?",
  "Yeah okay then the Thinkbook is better ig. Many external devices for laptops are coming with c-type connectors now, so thunderbolt 4 should be useful.",
  "I heard some say Thinkbook has bad build quality, but its got MS Office Home & Student 2021 and Thunderbolt 4 too, so its really confusing me."
