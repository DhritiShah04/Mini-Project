  "What laptop should I get? I'm an engineering student who also works in research and coding, and I'm looking for a new laptop. I was currently using my dad's old ThinkPad T450s, and it lasted 8 years and still works smoothly, but the battery life has deteriorated a lo,t and it's just not portable anymore. I'm looking for a new laptop on a more student-friendly budget that would work well with VSCode/Vim, Linux, and VMs. Here are some of my choices:\n\n**ThinkPad E-series 14:**\n\n* Intel Core Ultra 5 125U Processor (E-cores up to 3.60 GHz, P-cores up to 4.30 GHz)\n* 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\n* Windows 11 Home\n* Cost: ₹68.9k\n\nI don't know much about the quality and performance of the ThinkPad E-series, though. Since it has a U-processor, I'm a bit unsure about its performance.\n\n**Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3:**\n\n* 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13620H processor\n* 16GB RAM LPDDR5-4800 | 512GB SSD, expandable up to 1TB\n* Cost: ₹66k\n\nHonestly, the processor seems good, but I've heard negative reviews about the build quality of IdeaPads.\n\n**MacBook Air:**\n\n* Apple M1 chip\n* 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage\n* Cost: ₹59k\n\nAlthough I've heard positive reviews of MacBook Airs from professionals, the storage throws me off a bit, and many people don't recommend them for college.\n\nSome of the other laptops I've considered are Lenovo LOQ and ASUS, but these are my personal top choices. If you guys have any suggestions for any other laptops or experience with any of the laptops listed above, I'd appreciate any advice.",
  "I am also looking at laptops but I can say one thing for sure. **Do not buy a MacBook**, a lot of engineering software is not compatible or doesn't run well. I get that they are attractive in terms of battery life and power but it's just not good for this type of work. \n\n\nI also noticed that intel works a bit better with low level programming and is a bit more stable with Linux. The new intel CPUs are quite nice with battery life and performance. \n\nFrom the laptops that you provided I would get the ThinkPad with intel 5 125U, the performance is alright, I am using a Ryzen 5 5600H and this intel is better in every way. The build quality on ThinkPad was always ok, the E series are a budget friendly for people that can't buy a T series or X1.\n\nEdit: the CPU in the IdeaPad is going to be a bit more powerful in computing but the integrated graphics are way worse and the power efficiency is also worse, so I guess if you value battery life and graphics, the ultra is the obvious choice.",
  "I'm considering a thinkpad with ryzen 7 since it's also budget friendly. Def not considering a macbook anymore. Thanks for the advice",
  "Ideapad Pro 5/5i or Yoga Pro 7 * **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**\n\n$1500 AUD, Australia\n\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** \n \nWould prefer not to unless it's exceptional\n \n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** \n\nI would like a decent mix of all of the above, battery life would be important as I'd prefer to be less limited as a student. \n \n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** \n\n I am flexible but lighter would be better all else equal. \n\n\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** \n \n 14\" minimum but I'll take anything 15\" or 16\" gladly.\n\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** \n \nCAD yes, video editing/photo editing no, gaming would be nice but if the sacrifice is cost and battery life then probably not worth it for me. I have access to consoles so I can live without for now. \n \n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** \n \nIf I could play something like Cyberpunk, Ghost of Tsushima on high or greater at 60FPS that would be a dream come true but if it's limiting to a 2/3 hour battery it wouldn't be worth it to me. \n \n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** \n \nReliable build, good keyboard and input devices would be ideal. Couldn't care less about touch screen or finger print reader. \n \n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** \n\n \nMy original post was going to be (until I discovered the form):\n\nHello, this is my first post so apologies if it's not in the right space. \n\nI'm in Australia and in my second year out of five, studying electrical/engineering and computer science (ai/data science).

  "Looking for laptop recommendations  Hi im looking to buy a laptop this winter and I’m not that good at understanding tech jargon. Every possible laptop I find has both a good and bad review so it’s hard to settle on one especially given how much money I’d possibly be putting down. I have wanted to go down the PC route but I don’t currently have the means or space to have one, so I’m looking for a sturdy and reliable laptop to use as a substitute. \n\nIt will mainly be used for work, data entry and team calls, but I might download a casual game or two to play in my downtime. I’m not looking for a super computer- but something that could maybe handle my 40 dollar tablet plugged into it as my job has me drawing a lot. There’s a lot of laptops that can handle these things I know, but I’d appreciate honest opinions and suggestions of laptops that are durable and will get me through multiple years without breaking down. \n\nCurrently I’ve had my eyes set on the Lenovo loq, it seems to be pretty suitable for longevity. That, or one of the MacBook Air series. Any recommendations would be hugely appreciated. ",

  "Macbooks last more than double the time of a gaming laptop or pretty much any other laptop. I used mine for 8 years for work and it never once failed. Gave it to my brother for school and he's been using it for the past 3 years lol. Not the best for gaming honestly, maybe the newer ones are better though.",
  "Gaming’s not hugely important, I play maybe one or two games on my phone at most. I’m looking mainly for something that’ll survive until I move somewhere that I can have an actual office and buy a computer. I’m not making enough to replace a laptop every couple years so I might look more into MacBooks then. Thank you so much",
  "I had no idea they were that resilient, no one on my team has a MacBook so colour me surprised haha. Gaming isn’t a huge priority for me, I travel a lot so the mobility of a laptop will be nice, and on train rides I thought of just having one or two games on it to pass the time. If MacBooks can handle excel and drawing programs that should work fine for me.",

  "Review: The G18 (and G-Series), a laptop that somehow is worse than the sum of its parts **TLDR**: The G18 *looks* like a good deal. The specs *suggest* it’s a good deal. But if you're moving it around, the liquid metal that it uses instead of thermal paste will melt off and make it so your laptop will always be at 95 °C, constantly stutter and perform as if it were 10 years older in specs.\n\n\n\nFor context, I chose this laptop, because I’m an out-of-state college student who wanted to be able to game a little bit without bringing my desktop down and have decent battery life. For the price tag and specs, this thing looked like an amazing deal!  It was big, but I was fine with that. For the first month of using it, it worked exactly as I imagined and was able to handle any game I threw at it incredibly well(Elden Ring, Armored Core 6, Ace Combat). However, once college started, it began to have an issue that would be a constant theme in this story: overheating.\n\n\n\nInitially, I didn’t realize it was an overheating issue, but I started getting intense screen tearing and stuttering on games I previously played fine. I then chose lower load games, which were fine for a day before similarly causing micro stutters and tearing. I was trying to debug my GPU, but after making some posts on the ROG Forum, people pointed out my CPU was never below 95 °C. I was stuttering on every game to an unbearable degree, and at times the screen would tear and become unusable, and I had to restart. I could not play Terraria without stuttering!\n\n\n\nI sent it in to ASUS, during my first break, they “repasted it”. It worked for a week, and then it began having the same issue. I sent it in again at the beginning of the summer, they “replaced the motherboard”, and it worked for the duration of the summer. However, a month into starting classes, it began having the SAME issues, but ASUS refused to take it back because it was past a year at this time. I got it to a local shop, he again, repasted it, it had issues a week later, and then the guy broke the GPU somehow when I followed up and I just gave up and got a new laptop.\n\n\n\nNow you could just say it was a single defective laptop; however, I had seen this same issue occur with two other people who had the G Series. Overheating and screen tearing, with one instance it got so bad it wouldn’t boot up unless he had an ice pack under it. The customer support was atrocious, and I lost at least 100 hours waiting on chats and calls to go through the same steps to debug.\n\n\n\nI CANNOT ADVISE THIS ENOUGH. DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP OR ANY G-SERIES\n\n  \n\n\n**For people stuck with this laptop:** I think the crux of this issue is from the liquid metal and *moving around the laptop*. Over the summer, my laptop didn’t move around a lot, and it was fine, but in college, it had the issues fairly quickly. When I brought it in for local repair, the liquid metal was pooled outside of the CPU cooler. When he reapplied the liquid metal, I purposefully tried to get it to have the same issue to see if it was actually fixed(tilted the laptop to one side under heavy loads), and lo and behold, a week later it had issues. He opened it up, and the liquid metal was dripping off. I wish I could report how it performed with thermal paste instead, but in the process of repairing it, the repair shop fucked up the GPU somehow and kept trying to blame it on me (It had been a week, and the GPU was active before I entered the shop, left with the GPU not responding). Once I get home, I will see if I can fix it. I’ve had to buy a new laptop in the meantime, though.\n\n\n\nExamples of the many issues:\n\n[https://youtu.be/OU4nPqXKhzM](https://youtu.be/OU4nPqXKhzM)\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1krP\\_anIPwJS8HIyT0FIna7mQXGbCswle/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1krP_anIPwJS8HIyT0FIna7mQXGbCswle/view?usp=sharing) \n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nsJSWHq2mVCrlEFV3MY3HhD0JVyWdAg8/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nsJSWHq2mVCrlEFV3MY3HhD0JVyWdAg8/view?usp=sharing)  \n\n",

  "250 = 8840U\n\nKinda surprised they wouldn't use teh 260 instead (8840HS).\n\n13650 HX will demolish the 250 in performance with it's more cores, more threads, higher base TDP, and MASSIVELY higher turbo TDP's.  However, if you need to be on battery very often, the 250 will massively be able to get better battery life, and with it's RX 780M iGP, can even game a LITTLE when on battery without firing up the dGPU.\n\nBasically comes down to price and if you're buying it as a glorified little desktop, or if you actually need to use it on the go.",
  "It'll be my glorified little desktop. Don't care much about battery backup since I'll mostly use it plugged in.  \nPrimary use case is gaming (want to be able to play games releasing in coming 3-4 years easily on atleast medium, preferably high settings).

  "The price difference is around 10-11k INR which is probably around 120-130 USD. Is the price difference worth the performance gain (and potential heating)?",
  "Is gaming the priority?  If so, IMO, no, not worth it.  95% of the gaming performance is your dGPU, which is identical in both cases.  So while the Intel will get a few better fps better in most games, that's not TO ME worth the extra heat and price.",

  "HP Envy 15 4k OLED Review - addressing common concerns (EP-00XX Series) So I should preface this short review by saying I recently purchased the Envy 15 after about a month of researching laptops every day to find what I was looking for to replace my 10-year old laptop. For me, I wanted a laptop that was sleek-looking, has a glossy screen, and has enough power for casual gaming. In the end my decision came down to either the Envy 15 4k OLED or the Razer Blade 15 Base 2020 model with the 4k OLED. Considering the Razer was going to be about $500-$600 more to only step up the 2060 Max Q to a 2070 Max Q GPU, it didn't seem to be worth it to me. So I decided on the Envy 15, and while I initially had a few concerns, I could not be happier with my decision.\n\nIn short, this is a great, well-built (very well-built) and powerful laptop that has the most beautiful display of any laptop I have ever seen. I have had no issues whatsoever in testing all of my casual PC uses (web browsing, youtube, netflix, microsoft office, etc.) and gaming performance has been even better than expected. I've only run the new Microsoft Flight Simulator on it so far, but it is an extremely graphically demanding game and I've still been getting smooth frame rates at 1440p on high settings. No other game I play is that demanding, so for me performance could only go up from there. The keyboard is great, and the metal keys are such a nice change from the old plastic keys on my 2010 laptop. I've been looking for reasons to type stuff just so I can use this keyboard lol\n\nSince the reviews for this laptop were few in numbers, I wanted to make this review to specifically address the common concerns that the few reviews that do exist point out.\n\n* Dented Keyboard - I read in a couple of reviews that these units were being shipped with keyboards that were dented-in in the middle and suggested bad quality control. I can only speak for my unit, but I checked every row of the keyboard with a ruler and it was perfect. No spacing or denting at all.\n* Display \"fuzziness\" or \"meshy\" layer - Some of the reviews have also mentioned that this display has somewhat of a fuzzy or meshy look to it, possibly due to the AMOLED technology in the panel. One recent review suggests it's to do with the arrangement of the pixels in the display panel. After using the laptop for a few days, all I can say is that maybe if you look hard enough very close on a solid white screen or very light color you might can see a little something. But I have 20/20 vision and damn near strained my eye balls trying to convince myself I was seeing this meshy layer or whatever lol. This could just be from me being used to a 10 year old LED display, but I've been using this one for days and haven't noticed anything other than the best laptop display I've ever seen. The colors are so vivid and the blacks/darks are super dark. The colors are so vivid and the blacks/darks are super dark. The best way I can describe the display is almost like a photo after it's been enhanced and brought to life in Lightroom. I have a 4k TV and have preferred watching Netflix on this the past few days just because it looks so good. The reflection of the glossy screen really isn't as bad as some make it out to be, although I prefer a glossy screen so that could just be my preference. The only thing with the display is that one might need to use the Intel Graphics Command Center to brighten up the colors a smidge right out of the box. Other than that, it's perfect in my opinion.\n* Sound not that loud - I agree that right out of the box, the laptop isn't that great on sound. But that's because of the flat default preset in the Bang & Olufsen Audio Control panel. All you need to do is raise the treble equalizers near the top and slightly raise the bass levels and you will have some pretty great sound. I couldn't imagine needing it any louder without wanting to connect to an external speaker at that level. I do most browsing and watch netflix on around 60-70% volume and it is plenty loud.\n* Fan Whine - I have seen where some people have said that their fans have a terrible whine to them when spinning fast. Again, I can only speak from my experience but I haven't had this issue at all. People have said the fans get loud, and they do I guess. Again, maybe it's from me being used to a 10 year old laptop that didn't have this kind of performance, but even on high I don't find the fans to be annoyingly loud or anything. Sure, you can hear them well. But if you're playing a game, the PC speakers pretty much drown out the sound of the fans, or at least they do for me.\n* Temperature - Some reviews have suggested this laptop gets too hot. I'll agree that it does get hot, but I've had it on performance mode for a few hours at a time while gaming and I never found the unit (top or bottom) to be uncomfortably hot. Certainly never to hot to put my hands on the keyboard or anything like I've heard happens with the 2020 Razer 15.\n* Hamstrung GPU - I read one review from Micro Center that suggested the 2060 Max-Q GPU was \"hamstrung\" by the Intel Graphics which effectively limited the ability of the 2060 to be used by standard applications, like a web browser. The user said they couldn't fix it for anything, so they sent it back. One of the first things I did was change the Nvidia control panel to prefer the high-end graphics in the global settings menu and have had no issue. I can watch beautiful 4k video online with no issue or lost FPS, and gaming has been no issue either like I mentioned previously.\n\nAs of now these were the main issues people seemed to list as potential defects that I could remember and checked against my unit. If anyone else has anything they would like for me to check just comment and I'll be glad to do it. These were the main concerns I had before purchasing but still decided to take a chance as Micro Center has a decent return policy and I like to believe reviews tend to come more from unhappy customers. Hopefully if someone is on the fence with this laptop this review may clear up some of their concerns.\n\nI really only have great things to say about this laptop and would recommend it to anyone who isn't solely focused on competitive gaming. If you're a casual gamer like me that doesn't always need something crazy like 150FPS, this computer can easily handle that on good settings as well as any of your standard PC applications all while showing it on a great display. You'll just be limited to 60hz. I'm not really into 4k photo or video rendering, but the benchmark scores for my unit suggest it can pretty easily handle that stuff as well. In a nutshell, I'd have to say this is probably the best \"all-around\" laptop for $1500. For my purposes, I'd give a 10/10.",

  "I recall Dave2D comparing both Acer Nitro 5 and 7 on Youtube. While the Nitro 7 is the higher end model of the two with an aluminum cover rather than all plastic, he preferred the Nitro 5 because it had better internal cooling design.\n\nJust to be clear... it's aluminum, not aluminium you muppet.  :)\n\nIntel 8th and 9th gen Core CPUs run hot so undervolting is highly recommended. The 9th CPUs are basically higher clocked 8th gen CPUs for all intents and purposes. That means the undervolting potential is lower than with 8th gen CPUs; 8th gen CPUs can typically remain stable with a -125mv undervolt, but it seems 9th gen CPUs are only capable of dealing with a -75mv to -100mv undervolt before becoming unstable. Dropping down to a 9th gen Core i5 CPU can potentially mean better thermals because it has 4 cores rather than 6 core in a Core i7 CPU. Do a Google / Youtube search for a program called ThrottleStop which allows you to undervolt the CPU or limit how much the power the CPU will use so that it operates at lower temps. You can also limit the clockspeed among other things.\n\nI am not very familiar with Ryzen APUs. I am not aware of any program that will allow you to undervolt or otherwise limit the clockspeed of mobile Ryzen APUs. AMD released an overclocking / underclocking utility called Ryzen Master, but it only works with desktop Ryzen APUs. That means if mobile Ryzen APUs suffer from overheating, then your choices are limited to the following:\n\n1. Replace the thermal paste with something like Thermal Grizzly Kyronaut\n2. Go into the power options and set maximum processor state below 100%. Setting it to 99% disables Turbo Boost in Intel CPUs which means an i7-9750h will be limited to 2.6GHz. I assume for Ryzen APUs it will disable Turbo Core.\n\nAccording to the following article, the Ryzen 7 3750H provides negligible performance gains over the Ryzen 5 3550H.\n\n[https://www.notebookcheck.net/Not-worth-it-AMD-Ryzen-7-3750H-is-only-4-to-8-percent-faster-than-the-Ryzen-5-3550H.426841.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Not-worth-it-AMD-Ryzen-7-3750H-is-only-4-to-8-percent-faster-than-the-Ryzen-5-3550H.426841.0.html)",

  "Macbooks are absolutely shit for any 3D task, did you even read the use? \nMacbooks are only good if you're using it for regular work or Adobe products, the raw power you get with a MB is nowhere near to what these laptops offer at the same price",
  "Should be just fine yeah",
  "Im pretty sure the only difference is a weaker npu (used for imbedded ai think copilot) but it has the same amount of cores and clock, by all means it’s the same as the other ryzen.",
  "I also want to add for blender your gpu matters a lot more than your cpu so having the 14‘th gen i7 highlighted green doesn’t mean shit for blender, it for the most part only cares about rendering with the gpu. Cpu work loads would be something like compiling code, rendering videos, tho more things would enjoy the full cores from amd imo (like virtual machines) obviously not everything because there’s a lot of applications that like exclusively overwhelmingly large numbers of cores like photoshop. Id truly say top left is completely good for your workload. It’s also the cheapest and probably what you would enjoy most",

  "valid point but not for everyone u saying that you r always uses on desk while connecting to ac, but laptop is meant for its portability and macs always perform as on battery like windows performing on ac. Windows never able to performe the same on battery and ac.",
  "Bro out here talking like Maya just straight up refuses to launch on macOS 😂. People have been running Maya, Blender, Houdini, ZBrush — you name it — on Macs for years. Sure, macOS isn’t the king of every 3D pipeline, but saying it can’t run at all is like saying iPhones can’t open YouTube.\n\nAnd about GPU performance — no one’s pretending a MacBook has a desktop 4090 hiding in it, but Apple Silicon has some serious optimization going for creative workloads. Plenty of studios literally run M-series laptops for portability and still get solid results.\n\nAs for upgradability — fair point, you can’t slap in more RAM or storage later. But honestly, when was the last time people were out here hot-swapping laptop GPUs and RAM after the fact? Most modern laptops are already moving towards soldered setups anyway. It sucks, but it’s not some Apple-exclusive crime.”",
  "Calling MacBooks “shit for 3D” is like saying a Ferrari is “shit for off-roading.” Nobody buys a Ferrari to crawl through the mud — and nobody buys a MacBook to torture Blender with 12-hour donut renders. They’re built for stability, optimization, and professional workflows that actually matter.\n\nYou keep flexing “raw power” like you’re bench-pressing your laptop. Congrats — your RGB gaming brick runs Cinebench a bit higher, then sounds like a jet engine and cooks itself on your desk. Meanwhile, a MacBook with half the specs quietly keeps up in Adobe, Logic, coding, and even some 3D work thanks to Metal optimizations.\n\nAnd about that “same price”? Windows laptops in that range usually hand you a garbage trackpad, creaky plastic, and battery life shorter than a TikTok. A MacBook at the same cost gives you world-class engineering — brilliant displays, unmatched efficiency, and resale value that still holds years later.\n\nSo yeah, saying they’re “only good for Adobe” is just cope. The reality is, MacBooks are the industry standard for a reason: they get the work done without you babysitting Task Manager every five minutes.\n\nKeep clinging to “raw power.” Mac users don’t need to brag — they’re too busy finishing projects while your laptop is still looking for drivers.",

  "Huh, i guess i haven't catchup then.\n\n\"Serious optimization\" well, i it rhymes as \"8gb of RAM on Mac, feels like 16gb on windows\", but whatever works.\n\nAlso, hot-swapping? Do you mean replaceable?\n\nGPU? i guess only framework laptop does it, and nobody actually hot-swap RAM since it could damage your computer, or maybe you're running a datacenter. Which is actually a good feature to have.\n\nA lots of laptop actually started to use SODIMM again or the new CAMM2 interface after the previous generation use soldered RAM, especially in business laptop. But you know, swapping RAM is cheaper than swapping motherboard, so it doesn't really alight with apple business prospects. Most manufacturers use soldered RAM if they want a really slim laptop or just for saving as much money as possible for a very cheap laptop. Most proper gaming laptop still use SODIMM\n\nBut, the most RAM I've seen on a laptop is thinkpad P16 with 192gb of RAM, quite a lot.\n\nBut, again.

  "My guy, flexing about your ThinkPad with 192GB of RAM is like bragging your car has six gas tanks—cool stat, but useless when the engine itself is garbage. You can shove all the RAM in the world into a Windows laptop, and it’ll still freeze when you open Chrome with 10 tabs. Meanwhile, a MacBook with 8GB RAM is out here running Final Cut, Logic, Xcode, and a dozen apps like it’s bored.\n\n\n\nWindows laptops are like LEGO sets— “Ooh, you can upgrade RAM, you can swap storage!” Yeah, because you need to. They’re sold half-baked, and they expect the user to finish engineering the damn thing. Apple just gives you a MacBook that works out of the box; no duct tape required. You don’t upgrade a Ferrari with spare parts from eBay—you just drive it.\n\n\n\nAnd let’s talk build quality: half the Windows lineup looks like someone sneezed out plastic. Hinges creak, trackpads rattle, and fans scream louder than a PS4 in 2014. A MacBook? Carved from the tears of Windows engineers who realized they’ll never get a trackpad this smooth. That Retina display alone makes most Windows panels look like you’re watching Minecraft in real life.\n\n\n\nPrice argument? Please. A Windows laptop loses half its value the moment you unbox it. A MacBook still sells for absurd money years later—Apple laptops age like wine; Windows laptops age like bananas left in the sun.\n\n\n\nApple doesn’t solder RAM to “scam” you. It does it because the unified memory architecture makes it faster than your 64GB Frankenstein modules will ever be. You think you’re “future proofing,” but in reality, you’re just delaying the inevitable trip to Task Manager to end processes you don’t even recognize.\n\n\n\nSo keep your “192GB of RAM” ThinkPad. It’s a flex nobody cares about. Apple users aren’t even in the same game—they’re living in a different league, where laptops are thin, silent, powerful, and still look good in a coffee shop. Windows laptops? They look like props from a 2008 hacker movie.\n\n\n\nApple isn’t a laptop brand. It’s a lifestyle. Windows laptops? Just utilities… like microwaves.",
  "Bro, you just wrote an entire essay cosplaying as Linus Tech Tips, but it reads more like a Yelp review for Best Buy clearance laptops. Let’s go through your “points” one by one:\n\n“Coffee shop pretending” — Imagine thinking the global film industry, music producers, coders, and devs are just Starbucks extras with MacBooks as props. Meanwhile, your Windows laptop is pretending it’s an F-16 fighter jet every time you open Excel.\n\n“Scores higher in Cinebench” — Congrats, your laptop is king of synthetic numbers. Too bad clients don’t pay for Cinebench scores, they pay for actual finished work. A MacBook with “weaker” specs outpaces Windows laptops in real-world workflows because optimization > brute force.\n\n“Coding performance is the same on $1500 Windows” — Bro, no coder alive is flexing “frames per second compiling.” They care about efficiency, battery, environment, and reliability. MacBooks aren’t bought by kids gaming in their basement — they’re bought by professionals who don’t want to spend 3 days debugging driver updates.\n\n“Cheap laptops give durable trackpads” — Please. The fact you even put “cheap laptop” and “durable trackpad” in the same sentence tells me you’ve never touched a MacBook trackpad. That thing is so good, Windows OEMs have been trying (and failing) to copy it for over a decade.\n\n“OLEDs are miles better than Retina” — Sure, in theory. In practice, enjoy your oversaturated, burn-in-prone panel while my “outdated” Retina is still calibrated and color-accurate years later. Professionals need accuracy, not TikTok colors.\n\n“Every IT company uses desktops” — Yeah, for servers and rendering farms. You think Pixar is rendering Toy Story 6 on Dell Inspiron laptops? Laptops are for portability, not replacing a rack of RTX cards. Nice strawman, though.\n\n“Raw power is something you lack” — Bro, “raw power” is just Windows cope for “we can’t optimize software so here’s 200W TDP and screaming fans.” That’s not power, that’s inefficiency. A MacBook sips power and still punches above its weight, while your “beast” laptop gulps electricity like a frat boy at happy hour just to keep up.\n\n\nIn short: You’re flexing replaceable RAM and Cinebench like they pay your bills. Meanwhile, MacBooks keep dominating industries that actually matter. Keep coping with your sugar-packet upgrades while I sip my coffee, silently editing 8K footage on battery, wondering why your fan just hit Mach 3.",
  "Bro stop, you're making IT guys roll on the floor with jokes, being \"unified\" doesn't create a dent in in performance, no wonder you use a MacBook because you don't know the capabilities of today's hardware outside of Apple bubble, 8GB RAM is 8GB RAM 256GB Storage is 256GB Storage, the capacity is same, increasing speed will only increase the smoothness not lower the fucking limits, go and search how hardware components work\n\nOh and laptops fans running loud, that's how you cool things, I guess your MacBook can't do that because it is so unified it can't run the intensive tasks an actual laptop can, because it doesn't have the horsepower and support. \n\nWindows laptop aren't half baked, they're complete package, but just like any premium café gives you the option to add sugar as per your need a Widnows laptop gives you RAM & Storage upgrade as per your need, which is much better in longetivity with actual apps that makes your MacBook shut itself up over and over. \n\nWhen you \"upgrade\" something every year you wouldn't know shit about price, and the people who buy and justify MacBook's high re-selling price don't know the second a MacBook hits the shelf it is obsolete, tech upgrades rapidly, but unfortunately Apple's logo is enough to make you think it is a future technology when in reality a 4 year old Windows laptop outperforms it by miles",
  "kid please, go back to using iPads, the fact that you have never used anything outside of Safari clearly reflects here, your MacBook doesn't even have fans, you know why?

An M-series Mac running 8GB handles workflows that make a 16GB Windows laptop cry, but sure — tell me again how “capacity is capacity” while you ignore efficiency, compression, and unified architecture.\n\nAnd loud fans? 😂 You really flexed “my laptop sounds like it’s about to take off” as a feature. That’s not cooling, that’s a distress signal. Meanwhile, a MacBook stays silent because it doesn’t need to scream for help every time Chrome has 5 tabs open.\n\n“Windows laptops aren’t half-baked” — bro, they’re a buffet. Sure, you can add sugar, salt, RAM, whatever, but you also end up with bloated drivers, firmware drama, and a fan curve that sounds like Morse code. A “complete package” doesn’t mean throwing in every part and hoping Task Manager doesn’t beg for mercy.\n\nAnd the resale cope? A 4-year-old Windows laptop is worth less than a used toaster, while a 4-year-old MacBook still sells for rent money. Calling Apple obsolete the second it hits the shelf is hilarious when Windows OEMs drop 25 versions of the same laptop in a year, all forgotten the second gen 2.0 comes out.\n\nYou’re not exposing Apple’s “bubble,” bro. You’re exposing yourself as the guy who thinks upgrading RAM every year is a personality trait. Keep telling yourself your “future-proof” Windows machine with hot-swappable sugar packets is winning.

  "Nothing to do with'windows - but rather 'consumer' grade v. business build quality\n\nMost people buy consumer grade laptops that are essentially built to cost (as the manufacturer makes most of the money off the initial sale) - the whole strategy is to make the laptop lasts just so slightly longer than the warranty, after which if it breaks = extra $$$ for a new sale\n\nBusiness laptops on the other hand are built to last - as companies often pay (ridiculous money) for multi-year servicing plans on top of the initial purchase - so if the laptop breaks during this period, it actually costs the manufacturer money to repair/replace it\n\nThe extra cost of better build qualtiy (in terms of materials and often cheaper labour) up front is much less than having to pay for the man-hours of on-site support, skilled labour (often in a western country) and courier fees when trying to fix any problems later\n\nThere is a reason why thinkpads / elitebooks have a cult following - and many 2nd hand business laptops often out last the majority of consumer laptops sold new",

P series will typically all have slots vs soldered RAM, so a P1 may also be an option, but it isn't built to be light or have a long battery life. It's a higher performance workstation, but built on the X1 Carbon Extreme chassis vs the T14 chassis. \n\nGoing down in build quality, the L series also has full slots vs soldered. The T14 gen 5 has two slots as well, but previous generations only had one slot and one soldered RAM module.",

(Makes perfect sense, do away with the most common attachment we have available for network access)\n\nIf Lenovo brought out a version with 2.5mm mechanical key travel and a centered, reasonably sized touchpad, with the trackpoint retained and 3rd mouse button, they'd sell it on that alone, but add back every modern port we use and a few less modern ports for backwards compatibility, and they'd be golden. \n\nStick to 2 drives and a 3rd that can be an adapter or a drive, then 4 RAM slots, and offer upgraded motherboards every 2 years with new processor and GPU, for 30% of the cost of the laptop, and they'd be heroes. \n\nI thought that was gonna be Framework, but no.

  "Review of the HP OmniBook X Flip 16\" AMD So, for starters, this computer was purchased from [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/product/hp-omnibook-x-flip-2-in-1-copilot-pc-16-2k-touch-screen-laptop-amd-ryzen-ai-7-24gb-memory-1tb-ssd-meteor-silver/JJGQJRKGWR). I needed a high-speed and capable device for school.\n\n**Build Quality and Hardware:**\n\nMy model features the AMD Ryzen AI 7 350, 24GB RAM, and 1TB of storage; the build quality is extremely decent for the price! Hinges feel solid, although a bit loose, but they hold the screen without much issue.  \nThe entire machine is made out of metal, although there's a line under the display bezel, where the hinges are. The keyboard is decent, not for people who type 24/7. For school work, it's alright! Those who say the keyboard is \"horrible\" are honestly completely wrong. The flat keys are honestly really comfortable for casual school essays and work. The machine is heavy, almost too heavy, but it's fine, as this is a 16-inch model.   \n  \nOn the left side of the laptop, 1 USB-A 10GBPS port, 1 HDMI port, 1 USB-C 40GBPS (Thunderbolt 4), and 1 USB-C 10GBPS.   \n  \nOn the right side, 1 USB-A 10GBPS port, and 1 headphone jack. \n\nThe port order is going from top to bottom, from the display area to the bottom.\n\n**Windows Integrations and Bugs:**\n\nOkay, this model had a lot of HP bloatware, and the \"Poly Studio\" software really sucks out the resources. It comes with \"Poly Camera Pr,o\" which makes a second, sort of \"virtual\" camera, using your webcam. You can change the different filters, retouch appearance, and spotlight, just to name a few. This sucks a lot out of the NPU (almost 100% usage the entire time), and it actually messes up Bluetooth Audio quality, making a distorted sound for those devices.\n\nCopilot+ PCs in general are super useless in my opinion. I purely got this laptop for the quality and specs. Battery life stock software without changes was ok, but not really. Disabling AI features and uninstalling non-important HP bloatware made the laptop more snappy, quiet, and the battery life more decent.\n\nI heard about issues with Thunderbolt docks, which I've not run into. I use my HP Thunderbolt G4 dock with 2 24-inch HP Z monitors. and a USB mouse receiver. \n\nThis device comes with Windows 11 Home.\n\n**Touchscreen Display Quality:**\n\nThis comes with a \"2K\" 1920x1200 IPS display. In Windows, it says there's 10 touch points. The screen is very responsive to touch and the display quality is really not that bad as what I've seen on reviews. There's VERY slight backlight bleeding on the top of the screen, but it's not anything that noticeable.  \nThis folds, as the name says, and the flat keys make it more comfortable to hold and use as a tablet. The quality of the screen is very decent for watching videos and schoolwork. It is noticeably glossy and struggles near windows/daylight. The screen is very adequetly bright for inside use. It ALSO doesn't have AS thick bezels as the Best Buy pictures show, it's thin.\n\n**Overall Thoughts:**\n\nHP has really stepped up the game with their new OmniBook series. They're affordable, good quality, decent displays, decent everything. If you don't demand much, this is a very efficent device for the price.\n\nFeel free to drop your comments on the device, I'll answer as much questions as I can.",
  "Quick question for you. My 14\" model has a bit of a dip, or wave in the keyboard. It has been difficult for me to find out if the board is supposed to be flat, and mine has a factory defect, or if it is supposed to have that very minor wave to it.  \nIs your keyboard completely flat? Or, like mine, do you have a very shallow, but noticeable dip on the center/right side of the keyboard?",
  "I may be able to get my hands on this model, but with 32gb ram. 1500$ Canadian. \n\nQuestion for the cpu: does it handle heavy loads well? Or maybe my question is more for the cooling. Don’t mind if it’s loud, is it at least effective?",

I have been trying to get a laptop recently a good one with good specs for heavy work like Blender/Animation and Editing/gaming. \n\nAfter much thinking and research I found 2 laptop's available for cheap i.e. the Gigabyte G series G6 \n\nThe specs are: Intel core i7 13620H\nRtx 4060 8gb \n16 gb ram\n1 Tb ssd\n165 hz display\n16 inch screen \nTGP I am not sure off Because I could not find reviews of this exact model or anything online Displaying or telling it's TGP if we had to guess It could be 75w - 95 or even 100+ max TGP again idk and if anyone can help find out or knows the TGP of both of these laptops pls let me know.\n\nThe second one I found is an Acer Nitro v15\nWith an Intel core i5 13th gen H processor\nAn rtx 5050 8gb\n16 gb ram \n512gb sad\n165 hz display\n15.6 inch \nAgain not sure of the TGP\n\nNow researching online reviews about these brands i found out That Gigabyte uses third party partners to build these laptops and their service isn't very grade and uses basically just a plastic build.\n\nAcer wasn't any different I found reports of users online of a bad Customer service and cheap quality despite the high specs.\n\nBoth of these have users reported Heating issues, laptop not even lasting a year and having problems with batteries and screen in a month, bad customer service.\n\nIf I am going to buy a laptop as a first timer I want my laptop to last LONG like this is a big investment I want it to last more than 6-7 years and yes I do take good care of my stuff.\n\nI am really confused if I should even consider getting these laptop and I need an opinion of a real experienced human being If someone can help me decide and recommend me a trusted good brand laptop I could possibly go with.\n\nI found these laptop's in a price range from 750-850$\n\nSo if someone has something good in that price range that would last me atleast 6+ years and has good performance pls recommend me it.",
  "Well, pretty much both have non-existent product support.\n\nSo if something happens you need to hope that the shop or a repair center will help you.",
  "Don't get Acer...",
  "It's anecdotal, but I used to do laptop repair/cleaning as a side thing during Uni years and like 80% of laptops I would get were Acer ones, half of it is probably because of how cheap they are so there's just more of them, but still definitely not the best quality from my experience.",
  "Acer is way less bad. I hear nothing but swearing on gigabyte laptops honestly",
  "Anything but HP",
  "any brands with good customer services?",
  "Okay, do you have other brands or models recommendations?",
  "yeah ig that could be true but at the same time I think they shouldn't be needing that much servicing in the first place.",
  "See the first laptop I saw was acer giving a pretty damn good deal but those reviews do concern me a bit, tho Those reviews are years old so I need like updated reviews on these brands honestly it's my first time so I am just doing everything i possibly can to not get scammed",
  "I was just looking at some HP laptops... what's the issue with hp?",
  "In the Netherlands I had good experiences with Dell, Lenovo, HP and Asus.\n\nBut from what I have heard is that Framework(Most upgradable and repairable laptop manufacturer) also has pretty good customer service, but they're a tiny company.",
  "I've been in the industry a very long time. 30 years or so. There are about 3 companies that build the laptops for all of the companies. Those 3 tend to buy from a short list of suppliers. Most Dell, Lenovo, HP, and Apple tend to be built by [Quanta Computers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanta_Computer). I think Acer might be built by [Compal Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compal_Electronics) and I think Gigabyte are also. At a price point, say $1000, hardware reliability across brands will be similar since they all buy keyboards, displays, and drives from the same places. Customer service wise, there is a very big gap between HP and Lenovo on top and Gigabyte and Acer at the bottom. Dell is somewhere in the middle. Where possible, buy a model meant as a business line, like a Thinkpad, Latitude, Elitebook, or Probook.",
  "Lenovo does still do good cooling in their laptops. Most hardware is the same but some cut corners on cooling or structural items like hinges. Hp is a hinges company. Acer does structural and cooling badly. Asus is.. ok. Lenovo is also ok on most fronts. Most companies have their own cost cutting going on.",
  "they are shit like really bad even the elitebooks i used to have one for work in 2010 amazing machine but now they have cheeped out on everything",

What can be an fair price for this machine in india ?\n",
  "I would say around $40 USD; maybe if you clean the laptops upgrade the ram, and put in an SSD, you could get a decent increase depending on the market",
  "Not really worth selling. Maybe could get $30-$40 on eBay",
  "Maybe a hundred if lucky. But not really worth any price to be honest",
  "Just keep it, you can get a lot more value of it using it as a home server.",
  "How much bro ?",
  "20 bucks for the favor of getting rid of it for ya",
  "The laptop is older than my niece\n\nIm not going to do a full research on this laptop\n\nso quick Q is rhe battery new?\nIf yes then 600 rs is passable\n\nAre the hinges showing sign of\n\"Use\" as in needing replacement.\n\nStickers. Well\nThats atleast -50 rs\n\nWhen was thermal paste replaced?\nIf 3-4 years ago that's another -50rs\n\nWhen was fans replaced? \nIf never possibly another -40~100rs\n\n Or atleast that's what i would buy it off you as someone who have to sell a laptop with warranty to a \"costumer\"\n\nSo if anything i'd recommend on selling them to any student in need instead lol.\n\nIf its an nvme i would buy it just for the ssd tbh 🤣",
  "It’s barely worth anything",
  "You're not getting much for that, unfortunately. Not only is it dated, but it having Linux will certainly narrow the buyer audience. I'd probably just keep it and set it up as a light weight server/network node/NAS type of thing. Or if you're really into AI, you could set it up for a dedicated chatbot.",
  "It’s pretty old so I’d pull the hard drive and donate it to goodwill",
  "This laptop doesn’t even have an SSD at all it has an HDD 😬",
  "Does anybody know if this is a good deal? Pls help",
  "I was able to get a laptop with a newer generation CPU for probably $100-200 less. Only downside is less ram",
  "Acer is never a good deal. Its build quality is really poor.",
  "I would say it depends what you were trying to do on it.  Money for component wise I would put it on the more expensive side guessing its ddr4 and a gen 3 ssd and cpu is probably pretty good but maybe 4- 5 years old at this point",
  "AMD has done really good improvements on their newer, low-TDP mobile processors.  The processor on that is some generations behind, but the RAM and storage are impressive at that price point.\n\nI’d look for a laptop with a newer CPU and with the same RAM capacity, if longevity is a top priority.",
  "No gpu smh",
  "Yeah I've heard that too but I didnt know if this was a really good deal or not",
  "Im just using it for school and I'm in my last year so I don't need anything crazy, usually just excel work.",
  "Is there a specific model i should keep my eye out on?",
  "Are you specifically looking for brand new or can you do used",
  "if it's mainly excel and web browsing this is probably overkill imo",
  "No specific laptop model, just any laptop with a 7000+ series AMD CPU.  Look at this [Lenovo V15](https://a.co/d/2agcw8E) for example.  Has a CPU that is two generations newer and comes with just a bit more RAM for only $50 USD more.",

  "Which laptop company should i go for , considering a gaming laptop? which compnay is best to buy, i just want you guys to vote, i just want a budget gaming laptop with a budget $790 to $910 , im not talking about flagship series like Alienware, legion, rog strix , titan,omen etcc , im talking about budget series, G series, LOQ , TUFF , Nitro, Katana, Victus\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1nryo0l)",
  "selecting by brand ain't ideal as well as r/gaminglaptops may have helped you better, but regarding budget laptops would go with Lenovo LOQ (not the essential model) or Asus TUF, the Dell G Series are viable but often costs more from where I'm at that is enough to get a Legion or a Strix. As these models often the full power delivery with the GPU as well as CPU, good cooling, as well as often even bundled with better screen display.\n\nWith MSI, would avoid thier budget lineup, and would start at Sword (not Katana) or Crosshair series of them due to the build and performance especially with their GF63, Thin 15, and Cyborg that are very power limited to the GPU.\n\nVictus have a couple of issues especially with thier rating of TDP as see r/HPVictus as well as I see first hand that some laptops that have the same GPU may have lower or different TDP that marketed. So if you could buy first hand and test things out to confirm this is a plausible choice.\n\nNitro on the other hand is so, so... tho again relating to TDP marketing it as 75w but often settles at 50-55w which yea better than the models I said to avoid in MSI as these have double fans I think you have a better run with other recs.",
  "3 companies build all of them in China and Taiwan. with [Quanta Computers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanta_Computer) building most. Including Dell, HP, Lenovo, Apple, and others. They all buy parts from the same few suppliers. While occasionally a bad design for a hinge gets through, at a price point, reliability and performance at a price point will be similar. What differs is the service and support. HP and Lenovo's support and available documentation exceeds the others. Acer support has a really bad reputation for being hell to work with when something breaks. I suggest hanging out in the different brand subreddits and drawing your own conclusions about that.",

  "Should I buy this laptop? Long post ahead so giving the TLDR below.\n\n**TLDR :**\n\nThinking of buying a new laptop for Software/Computer Engineering at college. Laptop I liked - ASUS Expertbook P1 [16GB RAM, i5 13420H processor at approx ₹46k]. Suggest me any other good laptop (under ₹50k) or if should I buy this one or a second hand Macbook.\n\nThanks !!!\n\n\n**Original long Post :**\n\nHello Guys !!!\n\nI'll be joining college this year in a branch related to Computer/Software Engineering. \n\nAs a student, my requirements are quite simple :\n\n- coding and learning\n- multimedia and others\n- casual gaming (not that important)\n\nFor this, I've decided to buy a new laptop during the sale period (in India) as my old one is quite slow and I won't need it now.\n\nSo, I thought of this laptop by ASUS called as the ASUS Expertbook P1 (images are attached) and it has the following specifications:\n\n- intel i5-13420H 13th gen processor\n- 16 GB DDR5 RAM (upgradable upto 64GB)\n- 512GB 4th gen SSD (2 slots are available)\n- 15.6 inch Full HD 60Hz + 300 nits display\n- USB C charging with 50Wh 3 cell battery\n- full length keyboard with fingerprint sensor\n- US military grade certification \n- Windows 11 + Windows OFFICE 2024 \n- approx ₹46k price during Flipkart sale (goes lower with other offers)\n\nOFFICIAL LINK : https://dl.flipkart.com/s/849e_suuuN\n\n\nSo, that's it. \n\nCurrently, I am confused if I should buy this one or other one or a second hand Macbook.\n\nI read some reviews of this ASUS Laptop and others in general and the ppl said that the company has a poor customer service, bad laptops, bad battery, etc.\n\nI am not believing these things but I wanna know the truth, whatever it may be. Also, fyi I have 2 ASUS stores near my locality so customer service is not quite a issue ig.\n\nWrt this laptop - the reviews were quite good but the only negative thing was about the low battery backup of around 4 hours (obvious because it has an \"H\" series processor).\n\n\n\nIf I were be able to buy other laptop, this is what I'd looked for :\n\n- min 16GB RAM (DDR5 and upgradable is good)\n- min 512GB SSD (better if upgradable)\n- Windows 11\n- min i5 11th gen or equivalent processor\n- price shoukd be under ₹50k (approx $650)\n\nIf you have any other suggestions, please let me know. \n\nThanks in advance !!!",

  "Was wondering if I should buy this aswell, did you end up buying it or go with something else?",
  "Thank you for letting me know! I'm actually in Canada and not aware of a microcenter nearby. But I'll keep looking.   :)  Thanks again!",
  "I'm in Canada too and looking into this laptop (for the same price ($900)), thanks for the advice.\n\nI bought a samsung galaxy book 4 edge (snapdragon x chip, 1tb, 16gb ram for the same price), would you happen to know how i can compare these (im pretty  unfamiliar with this)? I think the snapdragon is newer, but based on my surface level understanding, it seems like the amd chip from the acer aspire go 15 is better (despite being 4yrs old)???",
  "Oh nice! It sounds like a good deal.    :)",
  "I went with the Zenbook A14 after seeing it in person. I felt that it was a better for for my needs, so I think it depends on what you will use it for.  Hope this helps!",
  "Yeah none in Canada. Definitely just head into best buy and look. Don't need to gat anything.\n\nI just picked up an HP Omni book flip x. Super powerful for it's size and weight and it's a 2 in 1. It was 700 USD with a ryzen ai 7 350, 24 gigs of ram and 1tb storage. It's igpu is pretty powerful too. No issues with 90% of soliworks. And programing has zero issues.  I'm even getting decent results running local llms on it.",
  "The snap dragon is newer, you kinda can compare them.  Some benchmarks will work on both so you can get values that way, just look for them online.  https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/6287vs4788/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-X-Elite---X1E001DE-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-5825U. Idk what snap dragon is on yours you can change it.\n\nJust keep the snap dragon. It's got way better battery life.",
  "Thanks!",
  "Does it get very warm under normal workloads?",
  "That sounds like a great option. I'll definitely look into it. Thank you!",
  "Thank you for the quick reply!! I'll check that out further. Its the lowest version of the current snapdragon chips (snapdragon x x1-26-100). It does have pretty great battery life so far! \n\nDespite being only a couple weeks old, my computer froze once last week (4 chrome tabs and 3 pdfs open, which i wouldnt call too taxing), it hasn't happened again since then. I was just interested in other options.\n\nEdit: grammer",
  "I haven't noticed anything so far",
  "Yeah a crash like that can happen to anyone on any device, it's just windows. But also, your CPU is ARM based not the normal x86_64 that most other devices are so that's really the biggest reason it's hard to compare them.  But also it being arm, it's new so some bugs and issues happening along the way is to be expected. That's part of the reason they are so cheap compared to x86 devices (at least they were when I was looking). They can have some software incompatibles but it's pretty rare/uncommon.  That's also something that'll change/improve over time.  If your curious, watch this kinda general review: https://youtu.be/w5h_1Buf54I?si=RpgUCwuDaaAHdXAb. It's old at this point and there's probably already things that have been corrected",

  "When I started shopping for a gaming laptop I read allot of reviews and comparisons, and the Victus would always loose. Most mention they use cheap displays and have problems somewhere down the line.\n\nThe MSI Katana often ranked better for the same price and specs. The Acer Nitro V also usually beat out the HP in most cases.\n\nI ended up getting a Lenovo LOQ with the RTX 5050 and I liked it well enough, but the Bios went bad, and I had to return it for a refund after just 14 days. When my refund came through, I found the HP omen 16 for just $50 more ($849).\n\nIt is a Really nice laptop with allot of features I was looking for, a beautiful 2K IPS display with 400nits and 165mhz refresh. 16gb ram, 1tb storage, RGB backlit keyboard, Core Ultra 5 / RTX 5050.

  "Asus ROG Flow Z13 (2025) VS HP OmniBook Ultra Flip Hi everyone,\n\nI'm debating between the two models. I'm planning to buy a laptop next month. I really want the performance of the Flow but the screen and the Haptic Trackpad of the HP.\n\nI have a few questions and I would be happy if someone who has the products could answer me. How bad is the Backlight Bleed or IPS Glow on the Flow?\n\nHow bad is the keyboard on the Flow? I understand that it doesn't always work and the Trackpad feels plasticky and not premium like on the HP. Basically, the only problem with the HP for me is the processing power, which is much lower because it's on Lunar Lake and the ports. \n\nMy main uses will be work editing using Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator and Figma and of course gaming.  \nDoes the HP capable doing this with no stuttering or lag? \n\nThanks in advance! ",
  "Why are you considering the omnibook \"flip\" exactly? Is money an issue? I dont think there is a mobile APU that can compete with the 395 Max. Battery life will probably be not good to just ok though. I bought my gf the omnibook ultra 14(no flip) when it was on sale with the HX 375(890m), i like it for games...she hates the keyboard. I would pass on the flip though HP hinges suck so them doing as little as possible is the best.",
  "I'd choose ASUS\n\nI don't trust HP hinges and they lock you out of a lot of control of your CPU, GPU, fan curves etc. ASUS has ghelper.\n\nAlso check if either has a vapour chamber for cooling, I suspect the ASUS does. That would be huge.",
  "Thanks for the comment , can you please tell me more about the HP hinges issues? I couldn't find online and I read and watch every review for the HP Omnibook Ultra Flip",
  "Wow thanks for the fast reply! I really want to go on the Flow seriously but I have few concerns one is the keyboard that literally everyone said it's a bit on the flexy side and the trackpad not as accurate as other vendors, because in my country there's no such a device for display/experimentation I have few concerns before I'll buy one I wish I could try it before I buy it but unfortunately this is not possible. as for the backlight bleed / IPS Glow is that really noticeable?",
  "Well, they would usually develop later on in the laptop's life, and it is not guaranteed, but honestly, a lot of 2-in-1s develop hinge issues. I personally don't think they are that good for the long term because the 2-in-1 part gets old, but you're stuck with a suspect hinge, but if you feel like you'll use it enough it could be useful to you.",
  "Before I bought my current laptop, I too was considering the flow. The reason I chose not to buy it was because having a flip device with touch screen and tablet mode simply wasn't critical to me. And having a laptop do that, it sacrifices cooling and battery life. it's also going to be way heavier than a tablet which is already too unwieldy for most, especially if used in bed. Not to mention the added cost. I found it better to go for a \"normal\" laptop (ASUS G14) with an iPad. I got both on discount so they actually cost me less than the flow would have. I've been really happy with my purchase over the past 2 years and highly recommend this approach if at all it is possible.\n\nNow, assuming that's not possible for you, the keyboard and trackpad are bound to be a little flexy given what you're asking of the design. You need A+ performance, enough cooling to support it and enough battery to make it competitive in today's expectations all while having high brightness, high accuracy display that is also touch screen and folds and don't forget the hinge and the ports...there's going to be points you struggle with because physics. It's not about finding the perfect laptop because as much as you deserve the best for your money, it simply doesn't exist. Find the sacrifices you're happy to live with and make a practical choice based on your use case. If a problem is easily fixable (example: using an external keyboard/mouse while you're on a desk, if you hate the one on your laptop) then it's not a problem. And from my experience, the problems an HP hinge gives you do not fall into a fixable category.\n\nAs for the backlight bleed/IPS glow...it can be bad. It depends on the unit you get. It was noticeable on my G14 for a few days, but I soon grew accustomed to it and it's never been an issue for me. I personally think the display is better than what I could have got from another brand even after the glow. Since I don't watch a lot of videos or movies on my laptop, it is never really black so it doesn't become an issue for me. That's what the ipad is for. If you do get a unit you find un-usable, you can always claim your warranty and ask for another one.",
  "thank you so much for the detailed comment I do really appreciate it,  \nhonestly I saw reviews for both products, I saw every video about it, and I couldn't find info about issues with HP hinges I also read reviews online, what are the exact issues with their hinges? do Lenovo also have these kind of issues? as for the backlight bleed honestly it's kind of deal breaker for me and OLED is important for me also latency is much lower, my only concerns for the HP is the low power intel lunar lake CPU and now you're telling me the hinges might be defects or degrade with time?   \nI could live with the flexy keyboard and buy external bluetooth one but this backlight bleed is really a deal breaker for me, I do feel lost here and would love to hear more opinions, honestly I wish I could test both of these products before buying and I do understand there's not a perfect one but both are pricy and I do want a product I could live with in peace",
  "Yeah, the bleed can be a deal breaker, I understand.\n\nEvery HP laptop I or anyone in my family has owned has had a hinge issue. I spoke to a bunch of people IRL, including their own customer service centre and the consensus is that the screws in their hinges are metal but the stuff they're screwed into is plastic. Over time, as you use the hinge, the metal screw eats into the plastic casing and it's just a matter of time till it fails. It's just a fundamental design flaw they haven't bothered fixing in years.\n\nI also really dislike HP because my first ever gaming laptop was an HP. I spent 7 months trying to cool the damn thing because it would just spike to 100C on any load. Turns out, HP locks their laptop on a bunch of low level settings like the current limit. Best I could do was undervolt my CPU and that just wasn't enough.\n\nThis is the reason I value a vapour chamber and GHelper so highly. It's a community built utility for ASUS laptops that turn off EVERY pre-installed ASUS service with a single click. It also allows you to quickly change backlight, display, CPU+GPU settings all in one simple, light interface. This also boosts battery life and your battery's life. The community for their laptops is just so strong that despite having faced a few issues (eg: my laptop just refused to start after being on sleep for a week) I am always able to find a quick and easy solution (I just had to hold my power button down for 60 seconds and retry)\n\nDo take my utterly biased opinion with a pinch of salt. My G14 is just a godsend and perfectly suits my needs after a tonne of laptops that have been total disasters and have all been from HP because HP and Dell were the only two companies offering a local service centre in my tier 2 city. Things have changed now and I have a lot more options. \n\nFor budget laptops, I always recommend lenovo and everyone who has purchased one at my suggestion is happy with their pick. My dad also uses a lenovo yoga pad and it's a perfect pick for something that folds and has a touchscreen, minus the vapour chamber. It's also not very powerful but then I got this one, brand new, for the equivalent of about USD 900. So yeah, I'd totally recommend lenovo with the caveat that I've never used anything by lenovo that cost over USD 1000\n\nAt the end of the day, it's about being happy with your purchase and I hope you find something that speaks to you.",
  "Thank you for the detailed answer I really appreciate it!  \nThe thing is that the FLOW Z13 doesn't even support HDR for gaming that a really downside for me , I think maybe I should wait a little more for the new ProArt P16 with RTX 5090 and 120HZ OLED screen, as for the hinge issues can you confirm this issue still present also for the new series OmniBook Ultra series?",
  "HDR is a big one too though I find that not too many laptops support \"true\" HDR in that even if they are certified, their peak brightness, especially when on battery, is not enough for a good HDR experience. If I wanted HDR from my laptop, I would look into HDR OLED monitors. Probably 27\" 1440p 120+ Hz would be a sweet spot I think. This also has the benefit of buying a laptop with a matte display which is much more usable in daylight or in brightly lit areas with better battery life while also having the colour accurate, glossy, HDR display for my main setup.\n\nI haven't used any HP OmniBook series laptop so I will not comment either way. What I can say judging by what I'm finding on the internet, is that it seems very reminiscent of the spectre chassis. Since it was a premium series, I think that is one of the few series with a metal hinge. There's a good chance you do not face the usual hinge issues or at least to the usual degree in this series. It's also 16:10 with thick enough bezels to hold it comfortably in folded mode which is nice. That being said, my friend who bought the spectre I've used also had to return it for some software issue (I only remember it stopped booting) and he ended up going for HP's envy series which I think he uses till date.",
  "Thank you so much for your detailed comments my friend, I took everything you said into consideration. Do you know any information about the Asus Pro Art P16 models? Will you recommend it?",
  "I've never checked it out and I'm not able to find a price on the thing so it's hard for me to compare but it does look really really good. It's Ryzen instead of Intel so that has some efficiency and therefore heat dissipation and battery benefits. Also means you can turn the RTX GPU off in Ghelper and have crazy good battery life. But I'm seeing some reports of limited support for Ghelper for this model so do look into this before buying. Your fans won't even be on because it has a vapour chamber. The 5090 is a bit overkill in any laptop especially one that's so thin, you usually won't have the power budget to run it at full tilt and even if you did, good luck cooling that thing. I think the value proposition drops hard beyond a 5070. Maybe a 5080 if budget is not an issue. But 5090 rarely makes sense even if you'd gladly set money on fire. I can see from their website that the max TDP+TGP is 135 so I'd personally go for a 5070 I think. Lovely port selection. 4K screen seems overkill for a 16 inch display, I'd probably run it at 1440p, 120 Hz for better battery life.\n\nBut yeah this thing clearly beats the HP in my opinion as long as you're okay with the 130 degree fold and assuming the prices are comparable.",
  "To be honest I really wanted to go on the PX13 because it's 2-in-1 but the 60HZ is deal breaker for me, and I thought Asus also announce new upgraded version for the PX13 with RTX50 but they didn't sadly I really think the annoucment is around the corner and I'm looking for leaks all over the web, the tablet mode will really come in handy to me I'll use it all the time, it was much easier if the ROG Flow Z13 had OLED HDR screen =/",

  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience). I have a Lenovo duet 5 now which I love but the snapdragon is feeling a little long in the tooth when I have more than a few tabs open.\n\nI guess my heart says Lenovo but brain said MacBook Air.",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop. Having good speakers is a great bonus for the Lenovo for me, as well as a bright screen. Don't need maximum power as for heavy workload I want to rely on remote desktops.",
  "Check your local best buys, in my area (SE Michigan) the Lenovo is on BB as a used excellent for $530 which is the right price point. So see if you can find one in your area for that price",
  "Unfortunately not near me but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nWhat do you think the chances of the kompanio lasting close to apple silicon?",
  "Not sure, thats a ChatGPT quesiton lol \n\nHappy hunting, hopefully you can find one soon.   I hear that they are high-end Chromebooks with Spandragon x Elite processors coming; I'm hoping they are here just before the holiday season.",
  "Ended up with the m4 MacBook air. It went on sale on Amazon for 750(!) and I can't find the Lenovo near me. Also mixed in the surface laptop for fun but the air just seems too good. Thanks again for your help!",

  "Cant decide what laptop Should i buy Hello fellas, \nLast month I started searching for budget gaming laptops and since I started , I have seen many reviews of various laptops \nLenovo's,dell's,hp's,acer's and asus \n\nI got scared to be honest because af various problems within every and each device of them\n\nBut now \nI am confirming for lenovo loq 15irx9 (i7 13650 hx with rtx 4060)\nAnd \nAsus tuf a15 (ryzen7 7435hs with rtx 4060)\n I've seen Acer nitro v16 (i7 14650hx with rtx4060) ,but its awful because of its 135 watt charger\n\nAnd I am scared of lenovo because of its motherboard issues \nAre they fixed with newers builds of the same device or its fiction?\nSo \nHelp me choose \nLenovo Or Asus\n\n",
  "Choosing between those two I'd get loq because of better cpu",
  "Unless you must go for laptops, desktop will be better for gaming",
  ">**I got scared to be honest because af various problems within every and each device of them**\n\nLike you said, every brand has its own unique problems. Lenovo has motherboard, HP has weak thermals and hinge issues, I think ASUS also has motherboard issues.\n\nI have been for quite sometime on Lenovo subreddits and I am hearing less issues with the laptop, also low preference for the lenovo LOQ's.\n\nI heard people suggesting to go for HP OMEN, Lenovo Legions, If these are within your budget.\n\nHP used to have bad thermal management and hinge issues, but the recent devices are coming with better thermals, but the hinge issue is still there. Some HP laptops have Hall Sensor Issues and someone also trying to get petition on [change.org](http://change.org) for HP to accept their mistake and get them fixed asap.\n\n  \nIf you could share your budget here, maybe we can find a suitable laptop for you. Also, please share your requirements for using the laptop? (Like editing or gaming or both or software programming etc;.)\n\nThank you and have a great day ahead!",
  "Omen and Legion are above my budget \nI have almost 1000 usd which is 710 Jordanian Dinars",
  "EDIT: If you are not in urgency to buy the laptop, please crosspost your requirements in different sub-reddits like r/lenovo, r/LenovoLegion, r/HPVictus, r/ASUSROG , r/Asustuf, r/AcerNitro , r/AcerPredatorHelios , r/AcerAspireLaptops , r/Dell and other reddits for r/LaptopDeals. Whatever response you get, make a list of those suggestions and put on a poll, then see a few reviews about them online and other blogs, narrow it down to TOP 3 list. Its just a suggestion, I guess you already have a plan on how to proceeed with choosing a laptop.",
  "Starting gaming after a bad breakup (Pls help) Had a pretty bad turn of events, where my ex broke up with me a month ago as she was not ready to fight for us in the family and got engaged a couple of days back, having a hard time, started hitting the gym and wanted to get back to the initial love of my life - Gaming. Have put a stop to it for the past few years, now that I've got all the time in the world I want to get back to it mostly to shift my focus and be myself again.\n\nI've decied to take a 4060 laptop and my budget is 85K INR (~1016 USD) These 3 laptops come under that in my country Please help me choose or suggest anything else which is better under this budget (85k INR ~ 1016 USD)\n\n1. Lenovo LOQ\n\n2. MSI GF63\n\n3. Gigabyte G series\n\nI've attached the specifications below.\n\nThank you all!",
  "Does it have to be a laptop?\n\nThey get very hot, i would reccomend a normal PC.\n\nIf you decide you want a PC, i would also reccomend you to build it yourself, as this way you can get it cheaper than buying a prebuilt",
  "Lenovo, but if possible, it’s better to take a 13th generation processor",
  "I recommend PCs bro... just because laptops get hot as hell. \n\nI mean sure if you travel a lot by all means or even if you commute a little bit and you can use it on the train or wherever you go sure by all means get a laptop. \n\nI don't stay at home much and i have a gaming PC but most of the time i play on the steam deck because i am not at home....\n\nHowever if you are saying 75%> of the time at home get a PC, make sure please that you have good case fans on it.\n\nI spent a week to fix my overheating GPU and it was the case fans that i changed months ago. I put weaker once after i gave my rgb ones to my nephew for Christmas....\n\nHave fun either way :)",
  "Please do let me know if I have to opt for any other model. Also, please do drop in any info about after-sales service and longevity, something with fewer issues, basically 🙈. I love playing AAA titles & mostly open-world games, so I will be using the laptop for mostly playing those. Thank you.\n\nAlso, will the prices be decreasing anytime soon? Should I wait?\nI live in India.\n\nAlso, I started hitting the gym, and it's been really helpful. So anyone out there planning to do it and haven't started it already. Do give it a try!\n\n(Writing it down here, as I'm unable to edit the post 😅)",

  "I swear by lenovo, and if you need to talk I’m here for u bro",

  "bitches am i right? but in all seriousness , LOQ is your best bet, MSI is dogshit, laptop's hinges will break and you don't need to deal with another stuff.... breaking..... and the Gigabyte's build quality is also shitty",
  "Desktop PC is a better bank for buck & more performance\n\nIn ur choices, don't even think about the GF63, the hinges suck, i can tag a video from jarrod's tech about testing it but afraid of backlash\n\nThe best choice would be the LOQ, better chassis design taken from legion series and better software support than Gigabyte's",

  "Personally using a Lenovo Legion and the build quality is solid. So thats my recommendation.",
  "LOQ can be had for 86k on the lrnovo website.",
  "Ask r/pcmasterrace",
  "I would go for a custom tower/prebuilt or a handheld. It you're new to PC gaming entirely, might be better for you to go with the former, as tweaking is much easier with that kind of hardware as opposed to the tweaking on a handheld system",
  "Bro go with 12450hx with 4050 pr 4060 from Lenovo website customisation options is available 4050 for 70k and 4060 for 75k and add ADP",
  "I will live and die by Lenovo. I have an LOQ 16 and since I got it I have upgraded the ram and storage with minimal effort and knowledge, both of which significantly improved the experience. Mine has a 4050 and runs modern triple A titles and unoptimized unity catastrophies with max graphics at 100+ fps, with the only issue being the high operating temperature.",
  "Go prebuilt and for long term",
  "My response was simple: You're becoming a gamer playing from a laptop? Well, get some MX-4 thermal paste and some external cooling fans first before you buy, and always watch the gooch on the computer internals every single 3 ~ 6 months, then heed to my says here.\n\nNumber one, do you have a fixed space for PC gaming? If you don't have a space, it's your character, welcome to laptop community. It's an optional word to answer. Number two., do you care about aftersales and longevity? If you care too curious about the aftersale and longevity, rush Dell Gaming, typically G15 or G16; and next tip the bill for extended warranty. They leave a spare space for another M.2 PCIe. Otherwise this one is optional.\nNumber three, hadn't you previously tapped or thought about being into using any controller or a Xbox™/PS on mobile or PC gaming? Users with a idea about playing all the AAA titles absolutely everywhere without connecting anything to the PC or they are former mobile gamers wanting to switch to PC, herald a ROG Ally for absolute liberty of mobility at the cost of slight performance. Otherwise it's optional and you can connect a controller to your laptop whenever you need.\nAnd four, do you have a bill to not play Call of Duty on your $1000k budget or not? Call of Duty do not support Intel GPUs, such as an ARC or an Iris Xe. For absolute Warzone gameplay, aim down sights on a Ryzen chip. Pay attention that buying a Ryzen ×000+ series laptop doesn't means it is latest - pay attention about the heck with the numbers, for example Ryzen (×) ××5× means a Ryzen laptop with a Zen5 - and a good value.\nReplace × with any number you say, 7×4× means a 2023 Ryzen chip with a Zen4.\n\nAfter you trepassed 4 questions now I may suggest PCs. The answer is simple and budget, and unfortunately minimalist of no Intel chips.\n\nNumber one: MSI. Bad aftersales but good specs. You tend to do it for cheap. Radeon dGPU + Ryzen 7 Zen3 7735HS make it a cheap choice for a staggering option, for $869.99 with a Bravo 15.\n\nNumber two: the ROG Strix. Asus computers who they are some little bit so HP. Many careless HP users weren't so anywhere gentle with the HP because they don't know it's fragile ... and so do anyone ROG. They have AMD R7 6800H and a RTX3050. They are $979.99\n\nAnd number three: DELL. Higher price, $949.00 for a staggering aftersale policy and DDR5, 1TB SSD - RTX3050 + Ryzen 5 6600H. You are left away with the remainder of 50$ or beyond for some Ziyoulang keyboard that sounds slick and a contemporary mouse. Or else.\n\nAll configs are 16GB RAM, sufficient for gaming.\nBecause 8GB or beneath feels like a you're an hostage of your framerates. Frames win games.",
