  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",
  "This is why I'm planning to upgrade my X1 carbon g5 to g13. It will be expensive, but it will be worth it I hope.",
  "i have one, i love it and find it enjoyable but im not a lappy connoisseur like you ive only had desktops for last decade, i will monitor this touchpad thing and touchscreen issue, but i use a bt mouse mostly, and i dont have this glow on the screen, or not that i notice, everything else seems manageable\n\ntry one more replacement, what other options are there right now? i dont think it looks or feels cheap. i like same things as you, the usb c on both sides, i like the weight and solid feel, the shiny bright screen, speakers, fast solid bt and wifi, keyboard, low bloatware, amazing battery and playing gta v\n\nmy bt 5.3/4 can let me use my earphones all the way in the shower room which i couldnt do with my previous 5.1 or whatever, thats big life immprovement for me\n\ni feel the top function row of keys the backlight bleeds through the bottom of the row a bit much depending on angle but not a big deal",
  "This is a very interesting review. Currently not many reviews for this model. Have you got chance to try other Lunar Lake models?",
  "Nice review! Would you mind sharing how the Aura's screen compares to the SL7 you previously had? And how the fan noise in the SL7 was for you in the same setup you mentioned with external monitor?",
  "Thanks for this insightful review.\nRegarding the fan noise, is it possible to use tpfancontrol (or more recent) to customise it ? On both T15 (Gen 1) and L14 they work well to start the fan sooner than the firmware does, but I do not know whether it is possible to delay the fan startup...\nThanks,\nP.S. : additional question : what is the lowest rpm that tpfancontrol can achieve ?",
  "I noticed a big difference in performance after uninstalling the bloatware. Battery is great, response is snappy, touchpad is fine, not great, screen is lovely.

Best non Mac I’ve ever owned, and I think the x1 carbon will be better in terms of build quality but couldn’t see myself doubling the cost for materials and same specs. \n\nAll in all, a very solid, reliable piece of equipment.",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",
  "For me, the biggest issues so far:\n\n1. Occasional phantom touches - similar to the OP\n\n2. eGPU compatibility (GPD G1) - it used to work with meteor lake laptop which I had (YogaBook 9i).

  "  \nI have had this laptop for a week. I have updated everything that needed updating (Windows and all relevant drivers). Everything is fine except for the Wi-Fi, which is very slow. I usually connect it to my phone’s hotspot (an S23 Ultra), and when I tested it with Ookla Speedtest, the download speed never exceeded 180 kb/s (0.18 Mb/s), while the upload speed reached up to 4 Mb/s. It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do? I bought this from BestBuy in the U.S., but I’m currently not in the United States. While returning it is not impossible, it would be very difficult, and I would prefer to resolve the issue without having to return it.",

  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues.

For example, unless it's one of the newest MacBook pros, you might be used to an incredibly glossy screen that leads to a busted user experience if there are windows or uncontrolled lights nearby.\n\nMy M1 Max MacBook Pro was also incredibly laggy for things like window snapping and some other things where I couldn't get rid of the animation and you just have to wait for part of a second from time to time before you can do things.\n\nPretty amazing that it compares to a multi-thousand dollar laptop, but also multi-thousand dollar laptops these days can be pretty disgusting, or at least that has been my experience with the M1 Max, and some Windows laptops from Dell, Asus, and Framework being laggy with windows 11.\n\nMaybe it's just a software problem though and I shouldn't be comparing wildly inefficient operating systems like Mac OS and Windows 11 to things like debloated Windows 10 or Linux on a 12-year-old Thinkpad originally rated for 24 hours of battery life.",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "How do the speakers compare to the MBP?  Thx",
  "I currently have the G16 and the aura and when it comes to speaker quality, these two are pretty close. the G16 has a slightly fuller bass and slightly wider sound stage. In my opinion if the G16 are a 10, the Aura speakers are a 9.5. I also feel the browsing experience to be much better on the Aura. I experience more lag on the G16 and the fans kick on, the SOC can get too hot for the G16 to sit on the lap, even with light browsing. That being said the track pad on the G16 is better. while the keyboard on the Aura is much better",
  "I was thinking of buying this but it has way too much bass, since I listen to music a lot that's a dealbreaker for me. Also, the bass resonates across the laptop body which creates a weird sensation if you're typing while listening to music. I tried adjusting equalizer in dolby software but still couldn't get the sound right. Did you find a solution to eliminate bass (so chassis doesn't resonate) and music becomes clear?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "I just did, looks good from any angle.",
  "Thanks for your review. I finally decided not to buy this model (it's in my cart for a few days).",
  "Thanks for the insight. Where did you see others complaining about the touchpad issue? If it's not isolated to my machine I'm afraid it may be drivers / firmware.",
  "sounds like an issue with Intel ultra series 2 to be honest.  \n  \ncan anyone who has tested other series 2 intel laptops confirm?",
  "I wud return it for the annoying spinning wheel alone",
  "I wish the X1 carbon line still had good IPS panels. OLED isn't for me. P14s gen 5 has a nice 120hz 3k IPS, I might consider that one.",
  "Hey, I'm thinking of picking up this machine, but I'm curious to know how much battery life you're getting?",
  "Haven't tried any other Lunar Lake laptops as of yet. There will allegedly be a SL7 for business with Lunar Lake next year, thinking about waiting for that. Though knowing Microsoft they'll charge an arm and a leg for 32Gb.",
  "I also posted a review of SL7 a few months ago if you wanted to have a look. The SL7's display is pretty comparable to the Aura's. It had worse PPI (201 vs 222), and worse subjective calibration making it bit washed out, but didn't have the IPS glow issues of the Aura. The AR coating was also better. I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve. The chassis would get way too warm in heavier tasks and the fan would hardly do anything. But still, I prefer the SL7's acoustics. No noise in a docked setup.",
  "Cant seem to get it working on the Aura.",
  "What did you uninstall? ",
  "Which bloatware did you remove?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "Thanks for the recommendation on uninstalling the bloatware.  Any update on the laptop?",
  "It's annoyingly reflective. And it's a pitty because under the perfect conditions it's really nice to look at. But it's a laptop so conditions change and are rarely perfect",
  "Is it a problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "The low RPM noise isn’t too bad, it’s just the fact it’s there at all that irks me. It’s completely unnecessary to have such an aggressive fan curve with a Lunar lake chip inside, but I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker. \n\nThe eye strain comes from the GPU, not the glossy display surface. Same strain when docked. Seems to be recent intel GPU’s from what I’ve read, causing issues for those sensitive to dither, or whatever rendering technique it is that causes the pain.",
  "The Aura screen dimensions are compatible with the MacBook Air 15. Get a MBA 15 compatible matte screen protector, and it'll greatly reduce glare and reflections on the Aura.",
  "was this 16 or 32gb of ram?",
  "BTW, as an update to my experience, I have my touchscreen replaced as it seems to be touchscreen issue instead of touchpad. For a week, touchwood, no such touchpad issues anymore.\n\nThe only remaining gripe I have would be the lack of compatibility with my GPD G1.",
  "Have you uninstalled McAfee already? It will greatly improve system performance. The Microsoft antivirus software built in Windows is better. That's probably the first thing to do after unpacking a new Lenovo laptop.",
  "It's really subjective. Do you have any issues with other modern devices? In laptops I find Intel Xe iGPU's to be bad for eye strain, Nvidia perfectly fine, AMD tolerable but not ideal.",
  "For my ghost touches issue, turns out I went to Lenovo repair centre to have screen replaced, then as of these weeks the ghost touch issue is gone for me.",
  "how did it go? did you send it in and is it still working?",
  "Hello \n\nI am going to buy this laptop soon.\n\nIs there display glare problem a deal breaker?  \nSome people mentioned : glossy displays leading to poor battery life because you have to crank up brightness to max to combat glare.\n\nThanks",
  "Its not easy to buy a laptop nowadays. many models and there are issues on each model. No windows laptop is perfect it seems, unless you pay big amount to Thinkpad series highend one.",
  "Luckily the 15.3\" screen is the same size as the Macbook Air 15, so you could pick up a matte screen protector.",
  "[I just reviewed it](https://smbtech.au/features/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-aura-edition-laptop-review/) and got 26.5 hours. That's a new record on my site.",
  "After using for some time, I think it’s similar to surface laptop screen. It’s reflective but with decent resolution. Colors are vibrant. I mostly work inside so it’s been fine. Working outside might be slightly tough because the screen is pretty reflective (not as good coating as MacBook). If you turn up the brightness to 100% that might make it better for outside work.",
  "I think the same, if not even better.   So loud and clear and good bass too.   I've tested both the 14\" and the 15.3 and had zero issues.  I think the one this person is talking about was just a lemon",
  "Not really, I just got used to it.",
  "Barely but yes. You can be outside (in the shade of course) and make do while in light mode. It's a mirror though, so you gotta find the right angle.",
  "Thank you so much - I really appreciate it. This makes it a buy for me. ",
  "Glad I could help make that tough decision! Not many choices right now that are similar to Yoga 7i Aura Edition but hoping we get some new releases soon...",
  "I read about a couple folks mentioning unresponsive touchpad in some YouTube comments and in r/lenovo comments as well",
  "You probably don't need this anymore but its around 8 hours minimum for demanding stuff, WAY higher with regular use. Much more than one needs. If you plan on using it for several days in a row, just bring the charger.",
  "As I sit here looking at my non-upgradeable to Windows 11 Surface Book 2.  You felt and looked premium, I paid a lot for your middle tier processor, I learned what heat throttling was, sometimes you think the screen is disconnected when it isn't, we had a good run. No more MS laptops for me thanks.",
  "Just read it, some great detailed insights there. Definitely swaying me towards getting the SL7, especially given the low/no noise from the fans which is very important to me. Thanks for replying!",
  "How would you compare the screen reflectivity between the SL7 and the Aura? Still waiting for my Aura to arrive",
  "OK, thanks for trying, it is good to know that it is not compatible... by the way, there are several variants, depending on the model (eg 1 or 2 fans) : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qjlal2/tpfan_control_on_newer_thinkpads_share_your/\n\nOn the Aura, there is also a built-in BIOS configured power management, accessible through Fn+Q command : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1fufeoa/lenovo_yoga_slim_7i_aura_edition_ama/lqcjek5/",
  "What if you set the performance/fan mode to quiet? Does that make it quiet enough? I'm thinking of getting this too and have heard mixed reviews about fan noise",
  "Ya, it’s been hit or miss on battery life. Touchpad gets finicky w longer use, appears to be pretty sensitive to the oils on the skin and any grime so I try to use the mouse. I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",
  "Its actually not too bad in person (at best buy) when viewed side by side to the book 4 screen.   I think the book 5 screen has more anti-reflective coating and they did not have that model for testing.",
  "Is the reflection problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "Does anyone tried this?",
  "It had been on sales for £1100 for the Aura 258V 32GB RAM model in the UK (e.g. Lenovo Store, Currys).",
  "Yes the 32 GB version with Intel 258V. Seems like some of the discounts are now gone.",
  "I have the same ghost touch issue, sending it in for repair under warranty in 2 days.  \nhow was you experience with the repair and is it still working?  \nAsking since i have heard many bad things about Lenovo's repair service.",
  "May i ask if you’ve found a solution for connecting to the gpd g1? I am looking to buy a compact egpu to use with the slim 7i aura on the go. 🙏",
  "That was one of the first things I did",
  "I'm looking to replace an old Dell XPS 9360 laptop with the following specs: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz 2.00 GHz. If I had no eye strain issues with this, do you think I should be ok with the Slim 7i Aura?",
  "Tell me how the type of graphics card can affect eye strain. Eye strain and other discomforts are caused by PWM and temporal dithering. These are defects or characteristics of displays, and intervening components are unlikely to be the cause, but I could be wrong. Please comment.",
  "I exchanged it",
  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast. The screen is very glossy though. if you work in a very bright room with bright background/light behind you, then yeah it can be very annoying to clearly see your reflection on the screen even at 80% brightness. it's depends see if you can find a sample in the nearest store.",
  "I like your little candy cane for scale",
  "Can you share me the settings that you have used while testing this and was there any major tweaks done to this? I got the same laptop but seems like my idle drain is little bit higher, although I did clean install of windows.",
  "Is it good?",
  "HP's new OmniBook Flip looks good, but its battery is a bit small. Maybe I'll wait for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura edition. It'll be very expensive at the release time though.",
  "A few alternatives appeared in recent months:\n\n[**MSI Prestige 14 AI Evo C1MG**](https://smbtech.au/features/msi-prestige-14-ai-evo-c1mg-laptop-review-2024/) – MSI’s, matte-screened 14-inch, business-oriented rival is larger, but more powerful.

  "Ah, interesting. Looks like a universal issue then.",
  "Both are glossy glass surfaces, but I remember the SL7 looked less reflective. The aura can look a bit mirror-like at times.",
  "My bluetooth is awful.  I can pair all devices, but they will NOT stay connected.  My earbuds connected, and I was able to use them for about 1 minute or so, but I could only get the Right side to receive sound.

  "You could try to check if the problem is related to your Windows install, or a hardware issue (e.g. WiFi chip, antenna connection). \n\nOne relatively easy way would be to create a Linux bootable USB stick (e.g. Ubuntu). Boot up from the Linux USB stick and check the WiFi speeds. \n\nIf the speeds in Linux are normal, you could then try a \"clean install\" of Windows (download Windows USB install media from Microsoft website).\n\nIf the WiFi speed in Linux is also very low, then it might be worth opening up the laptop and checking the WiFi chip and antennas (does not void warranty). Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",
  "Did you exchange with the same model? Or what else did you get instead?",
  "Understand it looks like a deal breaker to me, however spec is really good on this pc.",

  "If it's dropped like that again it will be Number 1, or very near it. Prices are a rollercoaster at this time of year and there's not much in it. There's a whisker between these and choosing what suits you best will leave you with a great laptop either way.",
  "The 9i looks like a nice machine especially with mini-LED, but the chassis is quite cheaply made, like the Pro 7. All plastic interior, including the hinge assembly.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo.

  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

  "Choosing between a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro X 14 & Macbook Air M2 So I am shopping around for a laptop due to upcoming travels and I am torn between these two. The specs of each system are as follows:\n\n**Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro X 14**\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS CE / 3.3 GHz\n\nRAM: 32 GB (6400Mhz) LPDDR5 SDRAM\n\nHDD: 1 TB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 x4 - NVM Express (NVMe)\n\nDisplay: 14.5\" - IPS / 3072 x 1920 (3K) / 120 Hz /400 cd/m²\n\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 / 4 GB GDDR6 SDRAM (integrated GPU: AMD Radeon 680M)\n\n[Macbook Air M2](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/midnight-apple-m2-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-512gb)\n\nThe base version of the more expensive one:\n\n* Apple M2 chip with 8‑core CPU, 10‑core GPU, 16‑core Neural Engine\n* 8GB unified memory\n* 512GB SSD storage\n\nThe price points are roughly the same (buying in Sweden FYI) so it's all down to choosing the rig I want really.I certainly understand that I get \"more\" hardware with the Lenovo option but would like to hear what the better pick would be in your opinion and what you would consider before choosing.\n\nI never owned a laptop before, strictly a desktop guy and I am not looking to replace my desktop. I am happy if I can watch movies (Netflix & downloaded), manage 15+ tabs while browsing and play some lightweight games (like Hearthstone) while traveling, obviously I wouldn't mind playing some more demanding games but it's just a bonus. I don't do any video editing or anything like that. I would use it mostly for the things mentioned and work related tasks which is mostly trading via web browser.\n\nI can not upgrade anything on the Macbook Air version without getting outside of my budget. I would have looked at Macbook pro 14 m1 if I had US prices, alas I do not.\n\nI really like the design/look of the M2 and the fact that it has a long battery life. Since I also handle sensitive data I like that Mac inherently have less malwares going around and being developed to target them (even though that number is steadily increasing). It also feels like less of hassle when on the go, lighter, won't have to always bring a charger if I know I have a full charge when heading somewhere etc. My concern is that 8 gb of ram will be pushing it even for non heavy workload stuff (I heard conflicting things, as a PC user 8gb ram sounds like nothing in 2023 tbh) as well as being shoehorned into not ever doing anything demanding would the need arise (I really can't think of anything myself on the spot though).\n\nThe Lenovo clearly is a stronger machine (not in all, but most areas) and since I am a PC guy it's slightly more intuitive to use (I have a Macbook pro from 2015 and honestly, I never found it very confusing when I used it either). Another positive is that I can simply transfer a lot of the stuff I need from my desktop, mostly a convenience thing though. I have tried my best to find reliable reviews of the Lenovo as specced above but they are rare to find, I am concerned that the battery life would be a disappointment.\n\nI am a Android user so I won't be syncing anything with the Macbook if that is a consideration at all.\n\nAny advice or just ideas that could tip me in either directions would be great. Thanks a bunch!",

  "What did you end up with if you dont mind me asking? Are you happy with the decision?",
  "Thanks a bunch for your input. I think the price is due to Apple being significantly marked up in Sweden and there's no costco/amazon to bail us out either :< The Lenovo is a returned unit so it's marked down about 100 bucks or so which helps as well. I am def. leaning towards the Lenovo at this point.  \n\n\nEdit: I did some research, seems like the Lenovo is on sale for [1099 USD at costco](https://www.costco.com/lenovo-slim-7-pro-x-14.5%22-touchscreen-laptop---amd-ryzen-9-6900hs---geforce-rtx-3050---120hz-3072-x-1920-display---windows-11.product.100976621.html).

After hiccups and loud fan noises, I'm not doing that.\n\nSo after a while of searching less expensive laptops, I found that. The only problem is that there are 3 reviews of this laptop, 2 say it's great, not very much detail, and the other one (which is on amazon) says the camera was defective.\n\nIs this a gamble worth taking?

  "My review of Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro 5900HX, provides surprisingly good CPU performance for its slim factor. **Info:**\n&nbsp; \nThe performance is incredible for its thin form factor; read further to understand why.\nThis laptop was bought from a nordic retailer called Elgiganten\n\n\n[Retail store](https://www.elgiganten.se/product/datorer-tillbehor/barbar-dator/windows-laptops/266806/lenovo-yoga-slim-7-pro-14-barbar-dator-r9h161tb)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nHere's a pic of the laptop: \n[Pic here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/583295616470220811/856933484484362300/IMG_20210622_182621.jpg)\n \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\nThe price is pretty hefty, but this was the one with 8 cores in stock, so I went with this after waiting almost 1 year since the announcement of AMD Lenovo Yoga slim 7 Pro 2020 August.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI will be using laptops performance mode called extreme capacity and a third party software called AMD APU Tuning Utility (that allows the cpu to consume higher power in longer run) AATU for short which will be used as comparison reference to see if there's performance difference with and without AATU during benchmark.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/JamesCJ/amd-apu-tuning-utility\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinnebench 20: Extreme capacity mode:**\n\nMulti Score: 4520\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 64 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 45 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/DvmFls1.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinnebench 20: AATU:**\n\nMulti Score: 4891\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 72 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 60 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/Dw1aXon.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinebench 23: Extreme capacity mode:**\n\nSingle score: 1470\n\nMulti score: 11442\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 65 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 44 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/1GeKm4H.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinebench 23: AATU:**\n\nSingle score: 1478\n\nMulti score: 12547\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 73 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 60 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/UFIqDe8.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Geekbench 5:**\n\nhttps://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/8527380\n\nEDIT: redid the geekbench putting the laptop under ideal condition this time\n\nhttps://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/8539588\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n**Aida64 Memory Benchmark:**\n\n[Benchmark](https://i.imgur.com/ZDONu1F.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**LatencyMon:**\n\n[Result](https://i.imgur.com/qXYhvga.png)\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Keyboard and trackpad:**\n\nThe key travel is a bit short to my liking, but I get used to it eventually. Lenovo comes with FNlock in escape key, which makes it easier to disable and enable. This is still a better keyboard to type than M1 macbook, though.\n\nTrackpad is a glass surface; while it's not that good compare to macbooks, it is still pretty damn close. Very smooth and enjoyable surface to touch. \nThe trackpad has a quiet click and doesn't rattle at all. The trackpad is firm in its stationary position.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Battery:**\n\n6 hours, with 60hz enabled and using multiple battery optimization. The screen itself chugs a lot of watt due to the resolution. Considering I'm primarily at the library with power plugged in, I don't find the low battery performance an issue. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nLenovo has built an excellent cooling solution wherewith restrictions temporarily removed, and it can sustain 60 watts in such a slim form factor that provides fantastic performance. Gaming laptops with 5900hx scored 4912, while my laptop with AATU reached 4872, which is incredibly impressive considering how thin the laptop is. \nSee hardware unboxed score of 5900hx [HERE](https://youtu.be/pdO4u87UCYI?t=229)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe build quality is up there with m1, and has a premium quality feel to it. The chassis doesn't budge when twisting the base. The screen hardly wobbles, although you kind of struggle to open the lid with 1 finger. The structure rigidity in this laptop case is excellent.\nCuriously, Lenovo decided to throttle performance, capping the max temp at around 85-89 degrees celsius. Doing this prevents the cpu from consuming more watts, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. \n\nAATU bypasses Lenovo throttle restriction and allows the cpu to get a bit more hotter while still staying within acceptable temperature according to AMD. This removal allowed us to consume higher power consumption which brings us better performance. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe fans are also pretty good at idle, where its very quiet and also very good when it ramps up to faster rpm speed. It's very subtle when the fans adjust the RPM speed. \nThe laptop fans stay very quiet even when watching twitch streams in 1080p streams, which is fantastic.\n\nThis laptop came with a lenovos premium warranty service where they offer live support and send technicians to your home to fix the laptop. I've waited close to 1 year for this laptop ever since lenovo announced the 4800H version of this laptop, and I'm delighted with this laptop.",

Not a lot of laptops have this option, so we might as well take advantage of it, am I right? 🤔\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlh6ab3n2k0g1.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=8074d26cf27bc4a88874acbc6d1ae2a215dd48bb\n\n# PRICE?\n\n>!**USD 884.15 or RM3677.64**!< *(This is the MYR price converted into USD to give you folks that are not from Malaysia an idea of the price I'm getting this laptop for. The actual Lenovo US version of this laptop may be more expensive, Idk) 🤷‍♂️*\n\nThis price is from the 11.11 sale in Malaysia. The actual non-sale price is slightly more expensive, but then again, considering how rarely you purchase a laptop, it would be stupid to not wait for a sale to buy. I'm assuming Black Friday will give an even bigger discount. Plus, Lenovo offers discounts for students in high school or college. So if you buy smart, you can get this laptop for even cheaper, making it even more of a steal. 😎",
  "Nice try, but flattery will get you nowhere.",
  "What laptop should I buy? Hey everyone! I’m planning to buy a new laptop soon, and I could really use some advice before making the final decision. My budget is around **$600 USD** or less, and I’m looking for a laptop that performs well, looks good, and works smoothly for daily tasks. I mainly need it for **work**, which involves a lot of **video calls**, so a decent **built-in webcam** is actually one of my top priorities. I also tend to have multiple apps and browser tabs open at once, so smooth **multitasking** is really important to me.\n\nOutside of work, I’d like the laptop to handle some casual gaming from time to time. It would be nice if it could run a few games comfortably without overheating or lagging. I also spend a fair amount of time streaming shows and videos, editing documents and presentations, and maybe doing some basic photo or video editing here and there when needed. Overall, I’m looking for a laptop that can handle everyday tasks with ease while still being enjoyable and comfortable to use.\n\nI’ve already done a bit of research and found a few models that seem to fit my needs, but I’m still not sure which one offers the best overall value. I’ll list them below with their prices, along with some quick notes on what I’ve found so far, but I’d love to hear your thoughts or any recommendations you might have.\n\n**$450 USD Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15IAH8**\\- 15.6\" FHD (TN, 250 nits) Intel Core i5-12450H (8 cores, 12 threads), 8GB (soldered) DDR5, 512GB SSD M.2 2242, 1080p Webcam, WiFi 6 , Bluetooth 5.2 , Windows 11 Home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the laptop's material feels cheap, it gets hot quickly, and the battery doesn't last long. It also struggles with gaming and can shut down randomly. While positive reviews say the image quality and Dolby audio are decent, and the camera is great for video calls. The performance is acceptable for work and school. It opens programs fast and charges quickly.\n\nThe second laptop is the same Lenovo laptop but it's the one with an **AMD Ryzen 5 7520U** processor, it does have some other differences so these are the full specs: AMD Ryzen 5 7520U (4C/8T, 2.8/4.3GHz, 2MB L2/4MB L3) 16GB RAM | 512GB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe | 15.6\" matte screen | Windows 11 Home (and Pro on another site). Camera: HD 720p with a privacy shutter.\n\nNegative reviews say that the display isn’t very bright, that it lacks touch functionality, and that the colors have a slight greenish tint. They trash the webcam, saying it's only 720p and not great. The hinge goes all the way back, and the keyboard isn’t backlit. The fan can get noisy during gameplay too.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has an impressive battery life, lasting about 10-11 hours with regular use. The 1080p display is decent, and the built-in speakers sound pretty good. The keyboard is snappy, and the large trackpad is accurate. It has a fingerprint reader for extra security, and you can even open the laptop with one hand.\n\n**$550 Acer Aspire Lite** 15.6\" FHD, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 8 cores Windows 11 Home | integrated AMD Radeon Graphics. DDR4 3200 MHz M.2 PCLE NVMe.\n\nAccording to some reviews, the battery life isn't that good, like 4-5 hours. This is the laptop that the sales clerk recommended. They said the camera quality is decent (like a normal one you would get at this price range).\n\n**$530 ASUS Vivobook Go 15** | AMD Ryzen 5 7520U | 16GB | 512GB SSD | 15.6\" | Windows 11 Home | 2.8GHz (6MB Cache, up to 4.3GHz, 4 cores, 8 Threads) FHD 60 Hz AMD Radeon Web Camera 720p.\n\nNegative reviews say that the fans are slightly loud. It's not suitable for video and photo editing. The webcam is mediocre, not the best one, basically.\n\nPositive reviews say that the battery lasts 7 hours and it charges fully in 1 hour. One review even said that the webcam quality was decent enough.\n\n**$550 ASUS Vivobook 15** AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 16 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM 512 GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD 8 cores integrated AMD Radeon Graphics - 15.6″ FHD windows 11 home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the battery life is not quite long enough to last a full day of work or classes. 1080p display has a cool tint, and it’s heavy at 3.8 pounds.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has above-average build quality and, reliable fingerprint reader on its trackpad. Its backlit keyboard was quiet and satisfying to type on, and its trackpad worked well.\n\nI don't know if this changes anything, but I'm based in Latin America, so do with that information what you will. Thank you in advance!",

  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",

  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",

  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Which laptop for engineering studies? Hi, I'm a 3rd year chemical engineering student who needs to buy a new laptop. I need to be able to do programming in Python and Matlab, have multiple programs open: PYmol, Chrome/DuckDuckGo, Slack, Zotero, Word, Excel, Schrödinger Maestro etc. with very often multiple tabs (minimum 10 tabs) open in Chrome/DuckDuckGo due to literature research/general learning.\n\nI'm currently doing the 3rd year/bachelor thesis, which is a literature survey and my current laptop is seriously lagging, freezing etc. I also use the laptop for taking notes during lectures, which can be up to 8h per day. So a good battery is prioritised, as well as good enough power to compile code for programming courses and some maths courses where we use Python to solve some assignments.

  "Looking for durable, long lasting, quiet, bright laptop. Doesn't have to be really performant. Good day!\n\n**===== Mandatory requirements =====**\n\n**\\* A good battery life**. So CPU+GPU isn't needed, APU should be enough. For communication, light programming, light 3D design, light music production in Ableton with not many VSTs, and similar tasks. Kind of \"a machine for a student\", I guess?\n\n**\\* A good build quality**. Probably full metal then, right? I don't want to deal with broken hinges and similar problems. I'd like to be able to throw it into my backpack and don't worry too much about breaking it (to an adequate limit, of course).\n\n**\\* A silent cooling solution**. I shouldn't hear fans at all in any tasks except heavy ones: VS+VSC in debug + browser with many tabs opened + etc.; Ableton in high quality with many VSTs. If APU is relatively weak, so it's not able to deliver high performance, but it never makes the laptop noisy too -- alright, that's fine too. It doesn't have to be the latest tech.\n\n**\\* A bright, colorful screen**. I have a bad experience with other laptops (some were older models, some were newer) loosing maximum brightness relatively rapidly. So, as for a typical no-brain consumer, my first though is to battle this with the higher maximum brightness, say 500+ nits. What, in most, but not all, cases, automatically means an OLED screen. What lies along the \"colorful\" requirement. I don't have a huge fear of burn-in, I'm using a Steam Deck OLED since launch and an OLED smartphone for a few years; but feel free to warn me if you see a need, you're welcome. IPS is fine too, but OLED is preferable. But overall, if you think that the idea of battling the problem of \"loosing maximum brightness\" with higher maximum brightness is dumb -- I'm all ears.\n\n**===== Optional requirements =====**\n\n\\* Small pleasant touches that everyone wouldn't be against having in their own laptops. Like a **comfortable keyboard** (I type a lot, like really a lot, well, you see yourself), **precise touchpad** (this would be great, to be able to finally efficiently use laptop without mouse), **nice sounding speakers**, **many ports** (especially USB-C), **fingerprint reader**, **low weight**, **fast and stable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth**, etc. Would be nice to be able to charge it with USB-C port, not DC, but probably that's already included in modern laptops, and I'm just not aware. Okayish webcam (if it doesn't have a shutter -- no problem, I'll glue it with a tape myself 😄).\n\n\\* **I have nothing against ARM** APUs (M1, M1 Pro or Snapdragon; I don't see a need in M2 and newer, but we'll see), but I don't want to be a beta-tester and especially pay for it with my own money. I don't want to have VS/NPM/VST/.NET (not .NET Core) and other more common-usage (old software) compatibility problems. May this even cost me a small(!) downgrade in price, performance, or battery life -- reliability is more valuable to me. So **x64 is preferable**. But if you have pleasant personal experience with ARM -- I'll gladly listen to your arguments, why not.\n\n\\* If the laptop doesn't suck air from the bottom (or does, but not only from there), so I **can calmly throw it on any surface including a sofa or a pillow** \\-- that'd be nice.\n\n\\* **A touchscreen, or even a transformer**. Just a nice feature in some apps, say in Internet browsing, but I can live without it. By the way, I just caught myself thinking that, on practice, transformers may actually be even more durable because of those 360-degree-rotating hinges. I wonder if that's true 🤔\n\n\\* Size? Hm... 14\" is probably alright, but I lean more towards **15\", and even 16\"**. Less portable, sure, but it's worth it. I have a moderately performant device with a small screen already -- my smartphone.\n\n\\* I think **16 GB of RAM** should be enough for a device of such performance. As for the **SSD capacity -- the more -- the better**, depending on the price. To the point of also having a quiet but big (few TBs) HDD inside as well (but that may be too old-fashined and so rarely present nowadays, I assume 😄). **I have no problem with opening a laptop** and replacing the SSD, if I feel satisfied, and I'm going to keep it. Same about adding more RAM in the future (if it's not soldered, of course).\n\n\\* **Antiglare screen coating**. Not a matte, but a slightly matte -- antiglare. After using a Steam Deck OLED 1 TB with such a screen coating I've started loving it and would like to have it here too. If can be purchased separately -- no big deal, I can purchase and apply it myself. But, probably, then better the screen be glossy, right? To not end up being too matte, after applying the external antiglare coating.\n\n\\* **If x64 then AMD APU**. I have trust issues towards Intel. But if you see them pointless -- alrighty, I can try Intel too.\n\n\\* **60+ Hz screen, preferably 120 Hz**. Yes, even OS UI animations become more pleasant to look at.\n\n**===== What about examples I've found already in this subreddit and not only =====**\n\n\\* **Macbook Pro 16\" M1 Pro 16/512 or 16/1024**. Yes, ARM, compatibility problems (potential and confirmed). But if x64 alternatives are much worse and/or much pricier -- seems like I'll have to deal with those problems then, spend personal time on relearning a lot of things (never used Mac before).\n\n\\* **Macbook Air 15\" M2 16/512 or 16/1024**. Older 13\" is way too small. And this is at the same price as a Mac Pro higher, so I don't see a point in this one.\n\n\\* **Asus Zenbook 14 OLED UM3402YA**. A lot of complaints on the noise, but an interesting variant.\n\n\\* **Lenovo Yoga 6/7, Yoga Slim 6, Yoga Pro 7, Yoga Slim 7 Pro**. Brightness looks very low (300-400 nits), but except that -- this is the closest I've found. There are complaints about noise too, but, in comparison, there seem to be not as many of them (of complaints).\n\nThank you in advance and take care of yourself 👋 Ready to answer more aiming questions if needed. Will look for it in Europe. Budget: \\~€1000 for something interesting just not performant, \\~€2000 for something both interesting and performant (Mac Pro).\n\n**===== Updates =====**\n\n1. [Asus Zenbook 14 UM3402Y](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Zenbook-14-UM3402Y-laptop-review-New-Ryzen-7-7730U-name-old-Zen-3-performance.724864.0.html)\n\n*\"Asus advertises a peak brightness of 550 nits which we can confirm only when displaying HDR content. When running* [*this HDR test*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlAsAuBtmps)*, for example, we're able to record a maximum brightness of 542 nits on our test unit. Otherwise, maximum brightness is limited to just \\~340 nits when displaying SDR content which is still in line with most IPS-based subnotebooks.\"*\n\nWTF Asus? I've been relying on this characteristic so much. Welp, at least taking this into account will now add quite a bunch of other models into the pool of \"interesting\" ones. A lot of IPS screens, for sure.\n\n2. Apple MacBook Pro 16\"\n\nThe same, 1000+ brightness is awailable only in HDR, in SDR its \\~500. WTH?",

I came across the Yoga Pro 9i on the Lenovo outlet store and I was impressed by the specs. Having a Dgpu is tempting, even though it isn’t an accredited piece of kit by Dassault.

  "Help me decide on snapdragon vs core ultra laptops, please!  Hi guys.\n\nLooking for a new laptop in 1500-2k$ budget. \n\nUse cases with context: \n\nMy bread and butter comes from financial modelling for which I have to extensively use MS Excel. My excel models have ~30 sheets (at max 40-50) with up to 1000 rows filled at max. File size ranges up to 20-25mb.\n\n I have multiple models open at a time (3/4) along with extensive web browsing (20-25 tabs for chromes, sometimes even 50) for research, 5-10 pdf files opened for reading, and usual PowerPoint/Word stuff. \n\nI’m also an amateur photographer. Currently I own a MBA which I use for raw image editing using the default Apple Photos app. I intend to keep doing it on my windows device as well (but maybe shift to photoshop if default windows photo app is not good). \n\nI also want to have the liberty of running python/R scripts on my laptop for basic automation, data analysis from time to time. But nothing hard core. \n\nPriorities: \n\nAbsolutely need strong battery life along with good keyboard and trackpad. \n\nDisplay: Need at least 90hz display if not 120hz. Will prefer OLED displays. 2k resolution at least. Also, touch screen functionality will be preferred as I read a lot. \n\nLooking for a premium laptop which weighs less than 1.5kg and does not get overheated/loud on fans. I’m going to start my post graduation soon, so will prefer something lightweight. \n\nWhat are my options?\n\nAs per my research, 16gb ram is the minimum I should go for but 32gb ram will make it more future proof. Processors that I want: Core Ultra 7 155H, Snapdragon X Élite 78/80. Can’t really decide which way to go. Reviews on snapdragon are good with significant battery life. However, if I similar decent performance and battery life in core ultra laptops, I am good with them too. \n\nSnapdragon Laptops that I like: \n\n-> Lenovo Yoga Slim x (cannot find any fault in this one. Only that 32gb ram/512gb hdd isn’t available readily) \n\n-> MS Surface 7 (only negative seems the keyboard which looks like from a MacBook which I am not a fan of; also IPS screen)\n\n-> Galaxy Book Edge (negative reviews on keyboard/haptic, small battery) \n\nIntel laptops: \n\nI like Galaxy Book Pro 4 and Lenovo Yoga Pro 7. \n\n\nSorry for the long post, but will really appreciate inputs! Thanks in advance! \n\n\n\n",
  "Could look for something with a Ryzen 8845HS if you want both performance and battery life. There's also the AI 300 series CPUs AMD is releasing soon that might be worth looking at. Snapdragon CPUs often have compatibility issues, though there's nothing else at the moment that beats it in battery life for a Windows laptop. Intel Core Ultra tends to be more expensive than AMD options despite not being any better.\n\n\nMight also want a GPU for photo/video editing?",
  "My vote is with Ryzen. Core Ultra is too new for me to say with certainty how good battery life with performance is, but we know that Ryzen had been very good with battery and performance. Not to mention that depending on the Ryzen chip you choose, as long as it's modern, the iGPU on those things range from as good as a GT1030 to up to near GTX1060.",

Can you recommend me some laptops? Also, don’t think I need a dedicated graphics. It’s mostly photo editing and rarely video. Integrated graphics with 32gigs of ram ought to take care of that. I think. lol.",
  "Will definitely look into the Ryzen offerings. One thing, Not that I am very interested in AI features, but how would the Ryzen chips fare in those?

  "Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9 (2024) vs. HP Spectre 14 (2024) - Quick Comparison / Personal Impressions Hi all,\n\ndecided to post a quick review / comparison because I see a lot of people are facing similar buying decision.\n\nI own an Intel 11th generation Yoga 7 Slim 14 inch laptop and am looking for something new. The Yoga 7 is really creaky, has really bad speakers and - main reason I want to switch - only has 60hz. My main monitor and smartphone have 120hz and for me its the biggest innovation in years. I only have a laptop paired with an eGPU (RTX 3060) for desk setup, which works pretty well. I also thought it would be nice to have a 2-in-1 laptop for travelling, long haul flights etc.\n\nTo cut a long story short, after some research I decided on the HP Spectre 14 and the Yoga 9i 2-in-1, both with the latest Intel CPU. I pre-ordered both, so I received each of them with almost no reviews (and therefore no BIAS) out there.\n\nBoth versions had new Intel CPU 155H, 120hz (glossy) OLED screen. The Spectre came with 32GB, the Yoga 2-in-1 with 16GB. I wont talk much about performance because it doesnt really matter for me. There are now benchmarks out to compare.\n\nthe sad news first: I returned both laptop\n\n||HP Spectre 14|Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Design|+/- Personally, I didnt really like the design. Its way better / professional predecessor, but I still dont like the bulkiness and the cut corners of the spectre. Looks somehow awkward for me.|No great design as well. Its somehow looks like an unproportional burger. The top of the laptop is smaller then the bottom, in combination with its rounded and glossy edges it looks very akward. I chose colour \"cosmic blue\" which is okay, but a fingerprint magnet|\n|Build Quality|+ Very nice build quality, solid materials - not creaky at all. Very good hinge.|+ Very good, cant complain. Not creaky at all.|\n|Speakers|+ Very good speakers. Quality reduces drastically if you use in tablet mode, since the speakers actually play in the opposite direction|+ I think the best speakers I ever heard on a laptop, since its basically a huge rotating soundbar. This is great in tablet and tent mode as well, because the sound is still going in your direction|\n|Trackpad|+ Very nice haptic trackpad, definitely the best trackpad I ever used (on track with Macbook Pro)|-/+ Trackpad is only ok. Its not haptic, which is a dissapointment in their flagship|\n|Keyboard|+/- Keyboard was ok, but I don't understand the hype about it. I might be biased because I use Lenovo notebooks at work and home for years.|+ Keyboard is nice. But as said, Im biased / used to use Lenovo keyboards. I didnt like the additional row right to the \"return\" button|\n|Display|- Overall, a very nice OLED screen. But no matter.  The screen was absolutely terrible in terms of the 'screen door effect', I couldnt stand the graininess. I had read before that this could be a problem, but I was sure I could get used to it, but in reality it was an absolute nightmare.                   - Another annoying issue with the screen is that it is barely dimmable. I often use the laptop in bed/dark surroundings to stream something before going to sleep. The lowest dim level is still super bright. You have to use extra software to dim it.|- Nice OLED as well. Drastically less Screen door effect to a level I could live with. Also, its dimmable to very low brightnesss out of the box. Unfortunately the screen is super glossy. I mean, so glossy that in dark enviroment even the backlight of the keyboard is reflected.|\n|Other|- The \"Power On\" button is illuminated constantly, which is very annoying|-|\n\nAs I said, I have returned both laptops. I paid around €1700 for each and each had major faults that did not justify the price for me. The main reasons were the displays, I think glossy is just not for me. While I could live with the Yoga's display, I really missed the haptic touchpad and hated that it only came with 16GB.\n\nThe search continues. I think im done with looking for 2-in-1 and will get a tablet instead. Basically all I need is \"good/very good speakers, haptic t rackpad, non glossy and minimum 90hz screen\".  I have now pre-ordered the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4, which has a matte display and a haptic touchpad, unfortunately it is only 13.5\".  I also assume that the speakers will be bad. Will keep you posted :)\n\nHope it helped!",
  "I'm deciding between these 2. The 2-1 format would be useful for document reading etc, but the glossy screen issue is a deal breaker.   \n  \nCan anyone attest to the effectiveness of a matt screen protector to counter act the reflection?",
  "THANK YOU. Finally, someone who actually addresses the screen door effect in both flagship models. I work in the professional visual industry and need crystal clear displays, or at least with less graininess like e.g. Surfaces. I got both the Yoga 7i and Spectre for comparison and it drove me insane. I'm returning both and ordered the 9i now after reading your review - I found a model with 32GB RAM.\n\nOut of curiosity (and to better justify my money spent...) - Would you surmise you would've kept the Yoga 9i if only it had 32 Gigs of RAM?",
  "Do you know if either laptop supports legacy S3 sleep?",
  "lmfaooo please give an update fast. I was looking to buy either of these and now I don't want to.",
  "I am looking for a similar laptop. Thinkbook 13x is really tempting but 14“ would be even better. A bit outside of the box but the new DELL precision 5490 is on the game for me. 14“ Matte bright IPS touchscreen, nice CPUs, etc. You can choose it without dGPU.\nOr maybe upcoming new HP elitebook x360 if it comes with a H CPU.\nMaybe Huawei Matebook X 2024 is an option, no release date on Europe yet.",
  "u/peyta30 FYI, the 2-in-1 Gen 9 is now available with a Sensel haptic touchpad upgrade in the \"Build Your PC\" tool. Right now it's showing as a $60 upgrade, but once the 2-in-1 goes on sale, that discount will also apply to the haptic touchpad.\n\nFYI, the haptic touchpad in the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4 is not from Sensel.",
  "Hey so I've also been tied between the Lenova Yoga 9i pro and HP Spectre 360 16 inch. Both in 32 GB. The main difference is HP uses a OLED screen but 2800X1800 Res while Lenova Uses LED 3200X2000 Res. The lenovoa looked brighter. The other difference is the HP is 2 in 1 where as the Lenova has the Ultra 9 core processor and HP has the Ultra 7 core processor. So one is newer processor and higher resolution. The other is 2 in 1 and OLED screen oh and the HP has much better speakers. My issue now is that there is another Lenova yoga 9i option which is only $200 more which comes with a Mini LED screen, a higher graphics card 4060X, and 1200 Nit brightNess which is exponentially higher then HP and most other Laptops. The ONLY problem I've seen with that higher Lenova 9i option is that the battery is listed at 5 hours but people have claimed it barely lasts 3 hours. Sigh* If it didn't have the battery issue, I'd get the fully loaded yoga 9i in a heart beat so now I'm still tied between the original 9i or HP Spectre both in 16 inch 32 GB with same graphic card.",

  "Gaming laptops heat issues Looking on the Lenovo web store for LOQ options I came across the new Ideapad Pro 5 that has RTX 3050 graphic card (16\" has upgrade option of 4050). The machine is slim, all metal, runs a Ryzen 7 cpu, and doesnt appear to have anywhere near the vents that a LOQ has. I can see where air goes in, but cant see where it comes out.\n\nThe few review vids that I found didn't really mention heat at all, like its just not a thing to bother with. No dramatic thermal images etc.\n\nSo I'm trying to understand why? Why does a business laptop with discreet graphics tick along just fine while gaming laptops have heat concerns despite air vents all over?",

  "Manufacturer Refurbished vs Open Box vs New laptop There's a particular lenovo laptop I want to buy, but I'm tight on budget and the sale on the New condition model ended at Best Buy. Couldn't find it anywhere else at the time, then I found that same model with a better cpu and double the storage on eBay. It says Manufacturer Refurbished certified— \"pristine condition\"— and it's priced similarly to the New condition Model when it was on sale. Also has 2 year warranty and a 30 day return policy. Looking at the comments, seller has positive reviews, but then again I'm hesitant as I heard that can be faked easily.\n\nWould you buy it if you were me? What do you think? Is Refurbished in cases like this worth it over a new one?\n\nI'm in no hurry to buy, but an answer to this would be hugely appreciated.",
  "So I actually purchased a yoga 9i from this seller on ebay. The first laptop I received had a slight dent at the bottom of the laptop (so it was not pristine) but the dent was not prominent enough & easy to miss. Besides that the laptop was quite newish, only 5 power cycles, no other scratches. The sealed battery warranty still had something like 10 months left from the manufacturer. \n\nI decided to return the laptop since they don't do exchanges & I felt it didn't match product description. It was a no hassle return and purchased again from the same seller. The second laptop was flawless visually. Only 1 power cycle but battery warranty had 7 months remaining. So whoever purchased this laptop new, got it 5 months ago, & returned it after charging only once. \n\nThe manufacturer warranty is initially zeroed out but after a few weeks was surprised to see it update to a full 1 year manufacturer warranty. The sealed battery warranty does not reset though. You also get a 2 yr 3rd party warranty.\n\nI am pretty happy with the purchase as I was able to save $300 over a new laptop. I would go this route again & purchase from this seller. \n\nI can also comment on bestbuy open box laptop. Great way to save some money. But you only get 14 days to return. The manufacturer warranty doesn't reset to full 12 months though (if I recall correctly). If the item is in excellent condition, it's basically new as described from my experience.",
  "There’s no way it’s actually refurbished by Lenovo and sold through this eBay seller IMO",
  "Thank you for the input! Really gave me some confidence with those refurbs 😁 and I'm glad to know that the seller is trustworthy. Although I have a few questions regarding your purchase:\n\nDid you encounter any problems in setting up the laptop? In your experience, what do you think of the performance of your laptop over the passage of time since you purchased it? (Since it appears a few months since it was first out of box). Would you be able to say it can stand 2.5-3 years of usage before showing signs of slowing down?\n\nI have high expectations in mind for the condition of the laptop to be as close to new in everything as possible (Personally planning to have it for some long years).",
  "No issues setting up the laptop, it was factory reset. The laptop came in a generic box with the laptop protected by heavy duty laptop bubble wrap. As for accessories, the charger cable and the stylus pen (since this was a yoga device) were included. Missing was the carrying sleeve which is included with the yoga 9i. \n\nThe laptop has been working just the same as it was when I received it. Performance hasn't degraded. And I don't expect the performance to degrade unless Microsoft decides to upgrade windows 11 with more features that impact processing or you install applications with more intensive requirements 3 yrs from now. \n\nThe laptop I received showed the battery health as healthy & capacity to be within 2% of stated capacity. Windows or Lenovo software manages the actual battery capacity for optimal battery life so it'll fluctuate. \n\nThe seller offers 30 days returns so you have quite a long time to use the laptop & assess whether it's as described on the listing.\nThe laptop you are looking at from ebay is quite nice, the AMD processor is fast & power efficient more so than Intel 13th gen. Overall fantastic deal.",

  "What do y’all think of this laptop? This laptop just got released i think, it’s an updated model of the 2023 Yoga Pro 7 (or Slim 7 Pro if you’re in the US i think?) it’s got 32 gigs of lpddrx5 7467, rtx 4050, and the new core ultra 7 155h. It’s more expensive here due to taxes and all that. It’s more compact than a gaming laptop (which is important because i wanna study IT in university and is planning to keep the laptop for 4 years or even more). Has anyone had this laptop? And if you have, could you review it? iirc the last year’s model had some complaints of the screen not being large enough. \n\nThe second slide is the previous year’s model with a 16gb lpddrx5 5200, with an intel i7 13700h. It’s about $200-$250ish dollars cheaper. The question is, is 16gb ram enough for the next 4 years? (I do play some games on the side, but nothing triple A).\n",

  "I'd pick the first one, core ultra. I think there is an option to upgrade the RAM.  Anyway, likewise the first comment, if you are the gaming guy, Zephyrus g14 should be better choice for you. Yoga pro 7i is a bit heavy, perhaps 1.5-1.6 kg which comes close to G14.",

  "Vostro 7510 Review/ Advice Request  \n\nI really appreciated this (and other) reddit when I was searching for a laptop, and wanted to return the favor with a quick review of this laptop. I am not a formal laptop reviewer, and don’t have fancy gizmos to check nits or color accuracy, but wanted to share. I have only been using it for about a day or two, and I may or may not post some updates as I use this more. There’s also some chance that I will return it. \n\nModel: [https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations)\n\n(purchased on sale for $1150 + 10% CB).\n\nI wouldn’t mind some advice from the sub on whether to keep this or return for one of two slightly more gamery computers that will seemingly solve some of the issues I have with this - either the Lenovo Legion 7 Slim or the HP Omen 16.1 AMD (if it gets released on HP’s site soon enough). \n\n**Background:**\n\nI joined a small business and needed a laptop. I purchased my last laptop \\~11 years ago and while it aged gracefully… that's like 85 in laptop years. Business required that the laptop have Windows 10 Pro, and preferred that it have biometric security. I wanted it to be thin, and have good build quality so it will hold up well. I also wanted to be able to play the new AOE when it comes out (i.e., light RTS and 4x type games). Finally, I needed the laptop yesterday so I didn’t have time to wait around for the best deal.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\nI think this laptop falls short in a few ways: (1) it spontaneously shut down the first day I was using it. Enough battery, updated Microsoft drivers, and no indication of why when I turned it back on. Not sure what it was, but I updated the Dell drivers and it hasn't happened again in the few hours of use since that. (2) Battery life could be better, once I was down to less than 40% after about 3 hours of (non-gaming) use (downloading and installing some applications, light browsing). As I type this I have 2:56 estimated remaining at 77% of the battery on “better battery” setting. The battery estimate was also all over the place. I don’t think it’s fair to expect much more out of a 56 whr battery, but I think it is fair to expect more than a 56 whr battery in this kind of laptop. (3) The keyboard is ok - typing feels nice enough, although I liked my old Lenovo’s keyboard a little bit better. The backlighting is a joke. (4) Cooling. I ran Offworld Trading Company, which was free from Epic Games at the time I received this computer, and after less than 15 minutes of play I found the palm rest to be warm, and (using a food thermometer) found the temperature to be over 100 fahrenheit on the speakers, and about 127 fahrenheit right underneath the vents. The fans were noticeably loud as well. Task manager says the GPU got up to 65c. That seemed pretty warm for a few minutes of play on a 5 year old game.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\nThe strengths are in the specs: i7 with a 3050ti, aluminum chassis (there is a very thin plastic bezel around the screen, but it's small enough to get over. Pretty good build quality. Touchpad is spacious. It’s relatively heavy for a 2021 laptop, but it has a dGPU and is pretty thin. Screen is pretty nice and color accurate, although I suspect nothing special in 2021. And I will be able to play aoe4 on this (when it comes out). \n\n**Dell Customer Service:**\n\nI also wanted to call out a good experience with Dell Customer Service. Without getting into the details, they made things right quickly and followed up to make sure things ended up ok. \n\n**Request for Advice:**\n\nWhen I was looking at this I was also between the Lenovo Legion 7 slim which is a few hundred dollars more, but has a higher refresh screen and the 3060. I decided that because I am looking to play RTS/4x games that are typically not AAA graphically intensive, a 3050 would be enough and I would be better saving the money. \n\nI was also considering the new HP Omen AMD 16.1, but it still hasn't been released on HP’s website (where they have frequent 10% off gaming PC sales), and given that I need something now, I may not be able to wait until they can ship it.\n\nNow that I have used the Vostro, and have pointed out the above concerns, do you think I’ll get (a) significantly better battery life on one of those other options, and (b) is the cooling significant enough to cause problems with my use of the Dell?",
  "Just 1 question. Does it have 1 or 2 SO-DIMM memory slots??\n\nOne review said 8GB is soldered. One Dell maintenance manual shows 2.\n\nI'm between this and the 15\" LG Ultra with the GTX 1650 Ti. The Dell has the true full size number pad, but the LG's is the crammed version.  For me this is between soldered ram or not. If 1 is soldered, then I'll have a tough decision. \n\nSo, please pop the back cover and let us know?\n\nThanks!!",
  "I reached out to Dell. They confirmed its 2x SO-DIMM slots that support up to 64GB RAM!",
  "You’ll need to consider whether you want a gaming laptop or not. The Vostro is not a gaming laptop and won’t perform like one. It is a premium build quality well rounded business laptop with top specs. It will get hot when gaming over long periods of time. If you want something with more power you should consider the Lenovo legion slim 7 or if you don’t want a gamery feeling laptop the Ideapad 5 pro 16.",

  "I just got this laptop RTX3050 version, and I have to say, I believe the design around the battery life and cooling system is very poor. I thought mine is broken, after reading similar stories from other owners similar experiences are confirmed. I’m frustrated and disappointed with this product from Dell. The battery needing to be bigger and cooling system larger. IMO it’s flawed heavily. You can’t game on it either, the RTX3050 is very weak. The screen is average. Considered returning it for a different model but I’m too busy at work. \n\nWould not go with a dell laptop again. I could of paid slightly more and got a different manufacturer with better specifications and most likely none of these cooling and battery issues.\n\nSorry Dell, but this product is piss poor.\n\nEdit: ram dota2 as a test, can’t even get more than 30fps avg, 1080p max textures details. My desktop with Radeon RX5700XT and an old 6 core sandy bridgy CPU sits just below 200 avg\n\n30fps avg in an esports game isn’t playable.\n\nEdit2:  it sure what dell were targeting with its design, it can’t go anywhere without its charger very nearby. Poor gaming performance, terrible thermals. That leaves users with an always plugged laptop that only runs word processing applications and runs like a volcano doing it.\n\nEdit3: screen is 60hz. 2021 they release a mid range laptop with this? Dell are you high? Reason I bought it? It was 40% off. I almost got my boss one whilst awaiting shipping. Pretty glad I didn’t get my employer an absolute dud laptop, that seems like dell were trying to offload\n\nEdit4: finally. At work we run all dell emc servers. Lost a lot of faith on dell consumer, and as a whole if they are pulling this kind of crap I n 2021. We are due for a major upgrade, HPE looking much more convincing",
  "So good",
  "I would wonder why the GTX card if not gaming... I mean, the type of computing (ML, linear algebra) I use for work with an Nvidia card is more demanding than gaming.  If it can't handle gaming, then it can't handle a work setting that requires a GPU.  Otherwise, most workers don't need a dedicated GPU for work (with Word, browsing, etc).  Just puzzled, what's the point of providing a GPU that can't handle gaming.",
  "I have one, same specs as OP but regular 3050, not Ti. It has 2x m.2 slots. The OEM ssd is a very short m2 2230 drive. The other M2 slot can take a normal full length SSD. The short OEM 2230 ssd drive is in the longer m2 slot with a weird metal arm to anchor it to the screw down hole at the end. So if you buy one of these you need to move the OEM ssd to the other m2 slot, then stick your full length SSD in the m2 slot you just took the OEM out of.\n\nIt's easy, and already inside the case are the two heat sinks for SSDs. One small copper one for the OEM shorter 2230 ssd, and a full size heatsink for a normal m2 ssd. \n\nEdit: As per my reply to the other guy below, the battery life is absolute ass on this.",
  "I can run the new Diablo 2 resurrected/remaster on this at max graphics no problem, as long as it's plugged in. That game is a little heavier that you would expect on resources. My Ryzen 4800u with integrated graphics can only handle about low medium graphics. So this thing's pretty decent.\n\nDepending on what you're doing, keep in mind the **battery life is horrible** on this thing. I'm getting worse life than OP when just doing very basic light tasks. I get 3 1/2 to 4 hours max. This is with screen brightness low, no USB devices, the 3050 dGPU disabled, and just using a webbrowser. No gaming or streaming. I've done all manner of tests to squeeze out better battery life and have had not luck (OS reinstall clean, different drivers, setting max CPU usage to 30%, etc.). Dell support told me 4 hours is good battery life for this laptop and referred to the battery as a ***backup battery***.\n\nAlso, if you plan to dual boot to linux this thing won't sleep properly. You can set it to suspend, which defaults to s2idle and uses about 14% battery per hour. Manually modifying the system to deep sleep doesn't work properly, it will start to sleep, then spin up the fans and turn on the keyboard light. This is with Nvidia proprietary driver software and the dGPU off and iGPU on. After researching it, lot's of dell notebooks are doing thing. Dell's forums show things like \"this model doesn't support being set to suspend/sleep and put in a bookbag\".\n\nHopefully this info helps. I'm in the process of returning mine. It's a nice enough laptop, but averaging 3.5 hours of battery life from extremally light tasks with my mentioned battery saving attempts is bad, the linux sleep thing is bad too.\n\nIf you'll mostly be on AC power all day, you'll be fine. But if you're on battery it will not last. Gaming will kill the battery even faster, and it will lower its performance dropping the frame rate badly on battery.",
  "Hey I think your laptop may be broken or you are using it unplugged, because a 3050 usually runs dota 2 at around 120fps at the 65W. Do you run dota while plugged in? because it only uses the integrated intel graphics when unplugged which could explain the low fps.",

  "Hey question, are you using windows 10 or 11? I know windows 11 has hit ALOT of laptops negatively in terms of battery life. I’ve heard some people getting up to 4 hours less than they would in windows 10.",
  "To tell the truth I didn’t run it more than a few hours on win10. I did find turning on battery saver made a difference, but it wasn’t major enough. I did also find apps like the brave browser automatically using the dGPU for no reason, setting windows to force it into the iGPU helped a bit.\n\nI did run manjero Linux and was getting batter battery life than when 11, but maybe just an extra 30 mins of light usage.\n\nOver all, I think the battery capacity (56Wh) is just a bit too low for something with an 11800h and dGPU. I tried buying an 86Wh battery from Dell before sending the Vostro back, but they don’t have them in stock.\n\nI moved to a Lenovo P1 G4. That has a 91wH battery, It’s easy to get 4.5-5 hours on that thing without effort.\n\nEdit: more info.",
  "Oh okay thank you for specifying more! Yeah brave turns on hardware acceleration by default for some reason. It’s quite annoying 😂 had a time I was wondering why my laptop fans were spooling up every time I opened brave and was always at a steady 10-30% usage.",

  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",
  "Which laptop GPU is quieter? NVIDIA RTX 3050 or GTX 1650 I need to choose between a config with a GTX 1650 or RTX 3050. Same laptop (Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro), though the 1650 comes with a 4600H while the 3050 comes with a 4800H (pure overkill for me). I have zero interest in gaming and would gladly go with an internal GPU if that were available. Unfortunately that would mean waiting 6 weeks for Lenovo, instead of just 2 days.\n\nCurrent laptop (ASUS) has an RTX 2060 with a noisy GPU fan. Hardly ever goes quiet even when I manage to get the CPU fan to quiet down. That's the main reason I'm replacing it.\n\nI thought the more powerful 3050 GPU would be louder but online reviews seem to imply the 1650 is actually quite noisy. Would really appreciate thoughts from actual users. I just want a laptop that runs very quiet.\n\nPosted this again so I could add the option to view poll results. Please leave a comment to explain why you prefer either option. Or if I should just wait the 6 weeks. Thanks\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/u0g3m8)",

  "I have a GTX 1650, and the fans only start up when I start gaming. And for a few minutes every now and then, but it’s quiet. If you don’t plan on heavy gaming, definitely go for the 1650.",
  "The gpu does not matter the laptops cooling capability. If you are not gaming the gpu isn’t being used to the point where the fans need to be on. Most of the time the fans might be on either side but they are dissipate heat from heat sinks that are shared between cpu and gpu. So if you cpu is hot you wil hear both fans. I own a laptop with a 1650 ti max q in a hp spectre. The fans spinning has no correlation with the gpu as the gpu isn’t on most of the time. A cpu will draw more power than a gpu at times resulting in the fan noise. \n\nIf I were you assuming you have the budget go for 3050 it is faster on a newer more efficient node and you have 8 cores which seems overkill rn but won’t be soon.",
  "It's a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro. \n\nMost reviews say it runs quietly but I don't want to take any chances, considering this is the main reason I'm getting a new laptop in the first place.",

  "Theoretically you are absolutely right. Unfortunately my experience with my ASUS ROG Strix with the RTX 2060 GPU has been different.\n\nThe GPU fan comes on all the time. Maybe it's damaged. I've tried absolutely everything. \n\nTried using ASUS laptop management software. Set it to Silent mode. Reduced the CPU processing power in the Power Settings. Even disabled the actual GPU itself. The best I've been able to do is turn off the CPU fan but the GPU fan is relentless. Even MSI Afterburner (the darling of the Internet) doesn't help. So perhaps you understand my worry here.",
  "Check on notebookscheck, they test noise aswell, measure It in db",
  "It’s an Acer Aspire 7 with a Ryzen 5 5500U.",
  "What I can suggest you try to trouble shoot the asus to rule the gpu out is disable it in the bios and see if the occurrence happens if it still does then it might be a thermal sensor triggering the fan not related to either the cpu or gpu. There are several thermal sensors used to determine when the fan runs. Just so you have the peace of mind when you buy your new laptop DM if you need more help",
  "Fab. Thanks",

  "The RTX version will provide a better experience. The 1650 will also run things, but not as smoothly and with not as good graphics. Tbh, the only reason I would tell you to look for a different laptop is the screen. 200 nit LCD is not too good. It doesn’t have HDR either.",

  "Asus Zenbook UX533FN-RH54. The best laptop for the money. My review. https://www.amazon.ca/ZenBook-UX533FN-RH54-Ultra-Slim-i5-8265U-Processor/dp/B07NDM56S8/ref=sr_1_1?crid=38JKR05RB82UO&keywords=ux533fn-rh54&qid=1561259495&s=gateway&sprefix=UX533%2Caps%2C220&sr=8-1\n\nI would like to start this review off by talking about some of the laptops I have owned in the past.\nLenovo Y560 15.6, Asus Zenbook UX32VD, Sony Vaio Duo 13, Apple Macbook pro 13 (2015) and the Microsoft surface pro 4. By far my favorite laptop out of these was the Zenbook. It was a 13 inch ultrabook with dedicated graphics, a gorgeous 1080p bright display and I had upgrade the HDD to SSD and added more memory to 8gb. I really enjoyed that laptop but had to let it go because of its poor battery life. So when my Surface pro 4's hinge broke up for no apparent reason and i went through two chargers and the keyboard kept disconnecting I thought to myself its time to go back to Asus. \n\nEnter the UX533FN.\n\nPrior to buying this laptop I had a lot of reservations. Mostly because of the touchpad issue people appear to be reporting and size and weight.\nSo here's my review after a week of testing:\n\n**Chassis 8.7/10:**\n\nWhen I held this laptop in my hand for the first time and felt its cold chassis and its finger print magnet lid, I knew I was holding a Zenbook. This is a solid laptop for its size and this price point. I cannot feel any keyboard flex for example when pressing hard down at the centre of the keyboard. This is not a unibody laptop however, and just liek my old 13 inch UX32VD, when you hold the laptop with one hand you definitely feel the bottom plate flexing slightly. Measuring at around 18mm, This is pretty thin for 15 inch but its no macbook air. Most of the thickness is actually thanks to the glass screen. The display's frame is pretty thick but I really like it. There's no flex to this display whatsoever and I feel like this is the compromise they needed to include the narrow 3mm bezels. The color of this laptop is dark blue. I would have much preferred the silver version but its hard to find in Canada. The keys are not blue however, nor are they black. They are actually very subtly purple. The rear lid can take on a blue color or a purple color depending on how light hits it. Overall this is a very good looking laptop. Despite being 15.6 inches, It is also only slightly a bit bigger than my old 13 inch UX32VD and weighs slightly more. This is likely the most portable 15.6 inch laptop in the market today. It is nearly a pound lighter than all other 15.6 inch competitors except for the LG gram IIRC.\n\n**I/O 9.5/10:**\n\nHonestly this is fantastic. One USB A 3.0 and one USB A 3.1 port, one USB C port and a FULL SIZED SD card reader for my photography work as well as a full sized HDMI. I could ask for thunderbolt 3 but personally I have little use for it as I don't intend on hooking this laptop up to any expensive monitors or gaming with it with a external GPU. I do wish I could charge with a USB C port rather than a old barrel style charger. However living with a Macbook Pro and Surface pro 4, I've learned that because the barrel charger can rotate freely in the port and USB/C, Surface charger and Whatever apple comes with cannot, the cord will probably last longer. \n\n**Trackpad 9.8/10:**\n\nI've heard horror stories but I cannot fathom why. Maybe I got lucky or maybe Its because I updated all possible drivers right as when I got the laptop but the trackpad has been completely flawless in the one week i've owned this laptop. As good as my Surface Pro 4 and better than my old Zenbook's. I will dock one point for the trackpad feeling a bit too sensitive? I feel like I don't need to tap that hard for it to register a click. Overall this trackpad is excellent, I have no real complaints.\n\n**Keyboard 8.4/10:**\n\nTo give you some prespective on this keyboard's performance, my typing speed is faster on this than on a Logitech G910 mechanical keyboard. This keyboard is fantastic. Plenty of travel, perfectly tactile, and the keys feel consistent. But throughout my rigirious testing of this keyboard it appears to have the same issue I had with my Vaio. If I hold down shift, and press E and space quickly right after, sometimes it misses the space. For example I am typing THIS IS THE BEST LAPTOP EVER. It will probably type it out as THIS IS THEBEST LAPTOP EVER. It will miss the space. I only do this if I am yelling at someone online so this isn't a huge deal to me. If i wasn't looking for this I probably would not have discovered it. On the VAIO though, this was a deal breaker as writing ING really fast would miss the G. So The Kin of scotland was....Havin more than one apple, etc ING is very common. Apart from this, I do wish this did not have a numpad and the keyboard was more central. it took a day to get used to this. The keyboard's lighting appears pretty even throughout although plenty of light leaks out which to me...is actually asthetically pleasing. The key caps when lit up, have yellow tinged lettering to go along with the bronze decorative elements of the chassis.\n\n**Battery life 9.5/10:**\n\nI am seeing 10 hours of web browsing time on a comfortable screen brightness level for indoors (around 20-30%) and 12-14 hours of typing a document. Note turning on the keyboard lights affects the battery life almost as badly as turning the screen brightness all the way up. \n\n**Performance, thermals, noise 9/10:**\n\nFor the money, for being an ultrabook, this has excellent performance. The SSD is fast, the laptop boots in less than 5 seconds. Its good for some light gaming. I was able to run Shadow Tactics: Blades of Shogun at the highest settings at 50 fps and thats as far as im willing to push this thing. Fans became audible and CPU temperatures got to about 80C (90C with Prime 95 torture test) but the keyboard and palm rest area never got hot and the underside only got slightly warm. There was no thermal throttling under my testing and I have not modified the voltage of the cpu either. The Macbook, old Zenbook and Surface pro 4 all had far far worse noise and thermals. The Surface Pro 4 got hot just browsing the web. Unless Im pushing this thing with Prime95, or gaming I cannot hear the fans. Ever. Not even when working in Adobe Lightroom. The Macbook and the Surface Pro 4's fans would be blasting at this point. There is no coil whine on my unit.\n\nWifi and blutooth both maintain a strong connection, no complaints here. Keep in mind Intel has a driver update for the wifi that Asus does not and it nearly doubled my Wifi Performance.\n\n**Display 9/10:**\n\nThis display has some of the best in class contrast ratios so photos are gorgeous on this thing. Colors definitely pop and blacks are very black. The narrow bezels also make a huge difference and I am definitely adding points because of this feature. It could be a bit brighter but at its brightest settings it is uncomfortably bright for me to use indoors so I think it is bright enough. Colors seem pretty accurate and it has about 90% sRGB coverage. For the price of this laptop, it is an excellent display with fantastic viewing angles. Windows hello is so much better and faster on this laptop than it was on my old Surface Pro 4. Even in complete darkness it recognizes me, even when Im further away it recognizes me and instantly. The two red glowing dots are also pretty sick. There is slight lightbleeding at the edges given it is a IPS panel but nowhere near as bad as my old Zenbook or the Surface Pro 4. This is not a touchscreen display, which for me, even if it was, I would not use or touch it. \n\n**Overall:** \n\nThis is not something I can say for the other laptops I've tested. Other than the keyboard bug, this laptop has provided me with the most headache free usage in the first week than any other laptop I have owned. You cannot beat this for the price for a portable, beautiful, premium productivity and multimedia machine. I was ready to return this thing before I opened the box. I was so prepared that at the first sign of trackpad problems or other issues I would return it but so far apart from the keyboard bug that I would never really encounter in real world use, there's been nothing. Keep in mind though there are better options out there for gaming laptops at this price point.\n\n\n**[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/5smjwD1)**\n\n\nI had also considered buying the Huawei Mate X Pro i5. Here's what it came down to:\n\nHuawei Mate X Pro Pros vs Zenbook:\n\n- Gorgeous high resolution display with 99% sRGB coverage and favorable 3:2 aspect ratio and over 400 nits of brightness (vs ~300 nits for the Asus)\n\n- Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C charging, External GPU support ( 2019 edition only, its not out yet)\n- Lighter and more portable\n- Fingerprint reader\n- Touchscreen (not relevant to me, I still have the Surface Pro 4 for touchscreen productivity)\n\nHuawei Mate X Pro Cons vs Zenbook:\n\n- No full sized HDMI port\n- No full Sized SD Card reader (huge for my photo editing work)\n- No Nvidia MX150\n- 256gb SSD vs 512gb SSD\n- Questionable Huawei support and future in North America\n- Nearly 400 dollars more expensive\n- No USB-A 3.1 port\n- Worse battery life (Notebookcheck)\n- Worse thermals (Notebook check)\n- Slower SSD (Notebookcheck)",

The machine stays very very quiet and pulls of a 11,3xx CB23 score which is actually a good bit faster than any review i've seen.  The best part is how cool to the touch this machine is under load/gaming..  Probably the coolest running chassis in a long time, granted the CPU is only pulling like 20\\~ watts while gaming even though I have it set at 40w (game dependent of course will change this).    It's a wonderful machine overall, not perfect but pretty amazing as a daily driver.   Battery tests coming soon..

Gotta test more first before I continue with anything else. \n\nIts a bit unfair to compare like this, but I do get a better experience off with a MBP 14 M1 Pro as the laptop seems more fluid compared to this. Currently I am testing the laptop with Best Performance mode; using mainly chrome with a few tabs (shopping + light browsing) and some Excel work.",

  "So, the laptop is pretty awesome. I’ve had it all week and have found that it’s gotten better with use. The first day I almost took it back because the touchpad was so bad and their own Lenovo Vantage application kept crashing. Once all the updates took effect and the laptop had time to settle in, there were no more issues. \n\nThe WiFi is incredibly fast, and I’ve never experienced a faster initial connection and any device ever, including iPads and iPhones and MacBooks. Instantaneous to the router as soon as your password is in. \n\nThe main feature of the snapdragon version was supposed to be the “snappiness” and the battery life. But this thing has been nothing but snappy—everything happens instantaneously. I’ve never had a machine this responsive. It’s like having your car switch gears without ever feeling the change in the transmission, just unbelievably smooth. That being said, nothing will be the battery life on a Mac, so there’s no real reason to compare. Their ARM efficiency is so vastly ahead of the competition that it’s not even a fair comparison. They’re strange machines to me (MacBooks) in that their computing power is unrivaled, but their interface makes them look like toys for kids rather than serious machines, which I suppose they are but just never really feel that way. My use case on the daily is for Windows-based computing, so that’s why I returned the m3 air I bought earlier this year (that and their new keyboard is awful, paper thin and the keys so closely placed I couldn’t type properly. I was going to lose my mind). Was able to get through work days with no battery life issues, ended up around 40% every day with about 5-6 hours of use, so definitely use dependent. I am not sure if the battery is compromised by having to run a virtual desktop all day? I’m sure someone here can better attest to that. \n\nThe screen is glorious—I’ve never been a fan of OLED for a laptop so that’s actually a plus for me. I almost went and bought a refurbished Lenovo for the mini LED screen it featured, but it was much bigger and heavier than this laptop. \n\nThe portability is insane; the engineering to pack a 15.3” screen while using essentially the body of a 14” laptop is mind boggling. I was reliant on my 2018 intel MacBook Air (still just perfect except for the giant bezels and dwindling battery life) until the aura, and, when you place the 13.3” air over the aura there’s only minimal excess laptop all around. Just an exceedingly slim experience. \n\nI wish the materials were just a tad more premium, with the feeling of the sleek aluminum from the Air still more solid in the hand. Being able to open the laptop with one hand would have been nice, but life goes on. \n\nThe x1carbon aura will probably be the perfect machine w the haptic pad and the choice of oled or IPS based on your preference, so if you’re willing to wait and spend double the cash for the same specs and a one pound lighter laptop then I would do so. I didn’t think it was worth all the extra cash for the upgraded materials, essentially doubling the cost. The HD is fast enough, and for my purposes shelling out extra for a 2280 disk would have made no discernible difference in daily use. \n\nAll in all, stunning and I’m glad I waited for this instead of the yoga 9i meteor lake which was what I was considering previously. \n\n32g \n1 tb \nWindows 11 pro\nAt no additional cost on Lenovos website I was able to also add Office Pro and Acrobat 2020, so that’s an extra $500 or so of software. Good deal right now\n\nArrow Lake and Panther Lake look promising. The future is bright for intel, and the spinoff on their design business is going to be one to invest in for sure.",

Prolly cuz Im used to using an OLED panel with my main monitor for my desktop, and I would enjoy the higher contrast and the true blacks more. But the IPS panel imo is not a dealbreaker. \n\n12. It is a software. So if you're concerned, you still need to use a sticker to cover it. \n\n13. I'll get back to you in a bit as the video is still running atm ><\n\n14.

  "Contrast wise, OLED definitely takes the cake. If we put OLED as 100, I'll put this IPS as 90.\n\nOLED will definitely and always be the better screen when comparing to IPS in terms of picture quality. \n\nYou also need to be slightly worried about OLED burn in.\n\nSo far IPS bleed aint really that obvious with a dark screen, I can take a photo of a black screen later. (Right now working on the 1 hour video youtube test)\n\nDepending on your perception, if you're watching a lot of contents, you could do better with an OLED screen.

  "It's made out of aluminum, but when i played around with the yoga 9i and the slim 7x they just felt like better quality. The one thing I didn't mention was the keyboard--it's phenomenal. The main reason I didn't consider the HP or the ASUS, the two main competing lunar lake laptops that look really phenomenal, was that I really disliked their keyboards. This is the best typing experience I may have ever had on a laptop. It's not that this computer isn't well built--it certainly is, it has the military grade durability and so on, but it just doesn't have a \"pro\" look or feel. You can tell it's consumer-grade material. It's like comparing a commercial kitchen product to a consumer grade line--they may be moth stainless steel but there's just a difference in the quality that's probably related objectively in some way, but it's difficult for me to describe or quantify. Please note this is a really nitpicky thing to say--this is the best laptop I've ever owned, and it's not close. I was between this and a macbook pro14\", but I'm super satisfied and felt like it was a great deal to upgrade the RAM to 32 and the 1 tb HD w the free office pro/acrobat std. Really good deal and very high quality with an excellent processor. The silence and coolness of the laptop are really evident as well. I played COD MWIII just to see how it ran compared to my prior Microsoft Surface Book 2 from 2017 which had 16 gb ram and a NVDA 3050 card, and it's not even close how smooth and well this computer handled it. \n\n  \nWould highly recommend if the OLED was an issue for you, because most manufacturers seem to be going OLED route, so if you are happy w the Snapdragon chip and there's no compatibility issues, the only real competitor here would be the Surface laptop, which would cost you another 1500 to have all of the above specs/software. I have been waiting to see what was next for my laptop world since it's been so long, I had to learn a lot about the chip game to understand what I was waiting for. I think the only thing I'd say is if you're not in a hurry, see how these compare to Strix point laptops. If you're like me and have more basic needs that aren't super tech dependent, this is an excellent daily driver. Of course if you have a specialized need you're probably not in this forum anyhow. \n\n\n\nFor the money, you can't get a better laptop. \n\n  \nHope that helps!",

However, if it is a mistake and it lets you place the order, it's possible that they might still honor the purchase and just eat the loss as a result of their mistake and still send it to you.

I only learned this after a month of waiting for it to arrive and it being in the ready to ship stage, still showing that they had stock. When the error was discovered they offered to cancel my order and find a machine that “fit” my needs at whatever price they were selling it at. No, I wanted a machine with the closest specifications at the price that I ordered and paid for the first one that you said you had in stock. They didn’t budge at all. I ordered a machine at $250, the next one that had the closest specifications was $750. The original price of the machine I ordered was $950.

  "Most likely true. I work at a very large company and work in picking and shipping orders, and it's generally the same for every company. If a product is in stock and is purchased, the order is automatically added to the queue and dropped in the next wave of orders for the warehouse workers to pick and ship it. \n\nMany times the packlist/order receipt will show the total price of the order, but nobody really pays attention and even if a warehouse grunt sees it, they will assume nothing and still send it out. No managers or financial workers will see the order until well after it is shipped and delivered in most cases",
  "I have worked at a popular grocery store for over a decade. In the U.S. if a store has a price sign in front of a product that indicates an incorrect price, we have to honor it. Otherwise it’s called bait and switch. I have no idea how this is handled online or internationally however.",
  "They don’t. Law undergraduate here. This falls under contract law. A website listing or product is considered as an **invitation to treat**, and not an **offer**. To define an offer, I will quote it from the case of Preston Corpn Sdn Bhd v Edward Leong: An offer is an intimation of willingness by an offeror to enter into a legally binding contract. Its terms either expressly or impliedly must **indicate** that it is to **become binding on the offeror** (buyer) assoon as it has been **accepted by the offeree** (seller).\n\nEven if the customer were to send an offer (by checking out), a **binding contract** is not yet formed because Lenovo has yet to accept that offer and they can choose to back out as there is no **legally enforceable agreement** yet. (A confirmation email is also not signifying of acceptance of order!)\n\nA similar example to this would be Chwee Kin Keong v Digiland Mall Pte Ltd. TLDR is that an employee keyed in a pricing for a product at $66 instead of $3,854 (MSRP) and the company obviously didn’t want to fulfil orders that were made and got taken to court. Court ruled in the company’s favour.\n\nIn consumer court, courts do consistently rule in favour of the seller during obvious pricing mistakes like a $1 phone etc. because they take the view of a **reasonable person in consideration and apply the objectivity test**. \n\nFor example, in this case, the court said:\n“I find ... that the plaintiffs, given each of their backgrounds, would in any event, each have separately realised and appreciated, before placing their purchase orders,that a manifest mistake had occurred – even if no communications on the error had taken place between them. Further, the character of the mistake was such that **any reasonable person** similarly circumstanced as each of the plaintiffs would have had every reason to believe that a manifest error had occurred.” . \n\nOtherwise, the court would also simply treat it as a **clerical or unilateral mistake** and not punish the seller. Similarly in this case, Lenovo would win.\n\nIf there’s any Law graduates reading this and want to improve on my stand, please do! I’m still studying and open to improvement",
  "Nope where it's clearly a mistake and you know it, they don't need to honour it",
  "They are not and three seconds of googling will support that. Just because you once managed to slip one through doesn’t mean that’s the law.\n\nImagine a computer store mislabelling a €4000 laptop at €1 and a large amount of units are ordered overnight while nobody’s at work. Your argument is that EU law now effectively forces this company into bankruptcy by being required to honor these sales that were clearly made exploiting an error in pricing?",
  "No....",
  "Depends on the Ts and Cs",
  "Yeah.... depends on if that's enforceable to a website in another country.... Much like the GDPR fines the EU charges.... a US website isn't subject to that....  even if they decide to keep data on you... because they're not breaking THEIR laws.",

  "True, but I was just giving an example to explain. However, if we look at it in layman terms, the universal legal principle will be the same. You simply cannot reasonably expect to enforce a contract based on a price that is **obviously an error**. So in any jurisdiction, I’m highly confident that Lenovo would win should this be taken to court. \n\nIf you search up similar topics, you will find that across common law (Singapore, UK, US) and civil law (France, Germany, EU), the courts follow the same reasoning:\n1.\tObvious pricing errors = no binding contract.\n2.\tBuyers cannot exploit a mistake they recognize.\n3.\tThe worst that happens to the retailer is refunding the money.\n\nHowever, if we are referring to say, a $599 MSRP laptop being listed erroneously at $499, the court may order the seller to honor some of the orders, which has happened in many jurisdictions before, since borderline errors (e.g., 10–25% off normal price) can be interpreted as a discount/promotion and would lead a reasonable person to believe that there is no mistake in pricing.\n\nIn this case though, it’s a laptop for $1. So it’s pretty obvious and no court would side with the buyer.",
  "Incorrect.\nTL;DR Lenovo (and most other companies) explicitly states that a confirmation email does **NOT** signify acceptance of the order. **No acceptance = No contract.** (This clause is commonplace for every business) Consumer will lose if he tries to go to court, even if he has the best lawyer. Below, I will cite Lenovo.\n\n**Full explanation:**\n\nA confirmation email, if you dig deep into any businesses’s Terms and Conditions (the thing that everyone ignores), has built in protective clauses in their Terms of Sale, and they’re not obliged to provide the consumer with any goods or service with a confirmation email alone. **Confirmation email ≠ acceptance.** A confirmation email only signifies that they have **received** the order.\n\nHere, I will specifically cite for this case, Lenovo. Under their T&Cs, it clearly states that **a confirmation of Lenovo receiving and/or processing your order does not constitute acceptance of the order.** (1.2)\n\nSource: https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/legal/new-products-and-warranty-services/?srsltid=AfmBOop9YcXqtlgbWWSEtLd4WCy7paTFtCMABKIs8xZmfYyPvIBRyTbc&ut\n\nIt also states under 1.1 that:\n\n1.1) **No contract** for the purchase of Products or Services will be formed until Lenovo accepts your Order by **one of the following**:\n\n**(a)** shipping the hardware Product and sending you a shipment confirmation email; or\n\n**(b)** making the software Product available to you; or\n\n**(c)** providing the Service to you.\n\nTherefore, that confirmation email is **not a binding acceptance** and is more of an acknowledgment that they’ve received your order and are processing it. Until shipping occurs (or software is delivered, etc.), Lenovo **reserves the right** to cancel or adjust your order **even if** you’ve already received a confirmation email or any other form of confirmation.\n\nI personally think that TV shows these days make the law seem very shallow to the average person, like; “Little guy sues company and wins!”. \n\nThe reality is, that every business has multiple built in protective and failsafe clauses layered into their contracts etc. to make sure that real consumers **will never win against them** in court. I feel like the average person should read more into the T&Cs so they know what they’re getting themselves into, but we don’t, so companies take advantage of that; and that is why we have lawyers :)",
  "Do enlighten me. 99% of companies in the EU are labeled “micro scale”. And also, way to deflect from the question about legislation ;)\n\n“A couple ten thousand dollars” in this case would be 5-10 laptops sold at the wrong price. You can see from this topic that ppl flock to these things like moths to a flame.\n\nMy most commonly used online computer store typically has a stock of about 50 of each gaming laptop, do the math on a say 5 of those products being mislabeled overnight and each those selling out at a €3999 discount.

The other two non-touch models are not.\n\nIf you want a glossy screen on a laptop, it is always worth going for a touchscreen model because the anti-fingerprint layer also has built in anti-glossy + anti-scratch resistant feature.\n\nAlso, tandem OLED on Lenovo laptops is absolutely stunning in person.",
  "I could not agree more.  The Dell XPS, starting with 7590 (that I know of) has one of the best OLED anti-reflective treatment.  The recent HP Spectres use the Corning Gorilla DX, which is an anti-reflective variant.  The difference is night and day.  It helps the OLED display work much better and reduce the mirror effect.  \n\nIndeed, the Galaxy Book5 Pro has it too, but the specs are not up to par.  If in fact the Yoga Pro 9i with tandem/touch is like a mirror, that would be a real shame.  I do not know why manufacturers are not including anti-reflective glass.  I'd gladly pay more for it and do not buy computers that don't have it due to my use case.",
  "Hello, I'm torn between the Yoga 7 Pro with an integrated GPU, Ultra 9 185h, and Ryzen 9 Ai 365, and the Yoga 9 Pro with an i7 13705h and discrete GPU, RTX 4050. I won't be gaming much; I'll be using programs like Autodesk, Matlab, and Unity. Which one do you think I should choose?",
  "Did you check galaxy book",
  "On the contrary, they look much better when there is any sign of reflection.  They actually make the computer usable.  I've compared my many OLED laptops side-by-side.  Those with anti-reflective treatment, like the ones with Gorilla DX glass, simply look superior.",
  "🎉",
  "Im thinking about it.  Has everything I want and coupon codes too :)",
  "Yes they are launching in June globally except north america",
  "The earliest will be June if you are not from North America.",
  "I have not read about any other laptop using this panel and reaching this much brightness. Dell has a tandem oled but they have capped the brightness to 400-500 nits. Lenovo might cap at 700 nits or maybe fully unlock upto 1000 nits. Battery life is a concern with high brightness.",
  "Not at all. 14 inches are other variants. You can check them [here](https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/expanding-boundaries-ai-powered-creativity-productivity-and-innovation/)",
  "The specs are totally not out yet.",
  "No matte options wow",
  "hella expensive man",
  "I am very sure touchscreen models have no anti-reflective coating. Matte option is available in non touch model.",
  "I'll know in a few days, but nowhere was I able to find in the specs that the tandem touchscreen is anti-reflective.  I have had several touch OLEDs that do not have anti-reflective.  Their specs show all four display variants use the Dragontrail Glass, which in default format has no anti-reflective.\n\nAre you saying that you have/have seen the tandem touch and compared to a non touch version and the touch obviously has anti-reflective treatment?",
  "the best is I believe is integration of anti-reflective displays in supply chain is still an issue and of course cost is a factor.",
  "Yea Galaxy Books come standard with anti reflective coating and they look amazing.",
  "How much discount per your coupon?",
  "when will north America get ?",
  "And later in the US?",
  "Check the new lenovo legions and in descrivtion it says pure sight true black 1000 so it should be the same tandem oled but nobody speak about it ?",
  "Hi Ok-Algae4024\n\nI was expecting around AU$4,000 which is not unreasonable for a Macbook Pro competitor. However, for my applications the Ultra 9 285H processor is overkill. In fact, the Ultra 7 255H is more than I need. Unfortunately, they have \"bundled\" an $800 extra (Ultra 9 285H) if you want to get the 3.2K Tandem OLED display. I will wait for the reviews WHERE ARE THEY! before I decide if the Tandem OLED is really worth the extra $1,400.",
  "It does. I have the laptop, Yoga 7 16 but with the same OLED touch.",
  "I don't kow about non-touch tandem oled on the Yogas specifically, but I've used several non-touch regular OLED laptops from Lenovo and Asus before which had no coatings. The yoga pro's reduction in reflection is about 40% as effective as a typical Macbook's LCD display. So not quite on the level of a really high-end glossy monitor.",
  "I think it's their patented tech and Lenovo would rather just give an option of matte display than integrating that tech into their supply chain.",
  "Pretty sure june. It's already listed on best buy. As usual, north america will not get the 5070 and 64gb ram variant.",
  "Yes for North America it is scheduled to be launched in the second half of the year.",
  "I don't know where you are getting that info from.",
  "Are there any other windows laptops that are considered MacBook Pro competitors - and out of interest, what makes this model to be one?\n\nI could see details on the Lenovo site about a haptic trackpad etc.",
  "Can you post a review",
  "Hi tinybn\n\nI cannot find a Yoga Pro 7  16 with a tandem OLED display on the Lenovo (US) website. The only model advertised with an Tandem OLED display is the Yoga Pro 9 16 (Part Number 83L0CTO1WWUS1).\n\nCould you please supply a link to the Yoga Pro 7 16 which has the Tandem OLED display.",
  "I just got the Yoga Pro 9i Aura with tandem OLED and touch options.  It is a mirror--just as, if not more reflective than my other most reflective OLED laptop.  Putting it next to a Spectre 16 with Corning Gorilla DX, it is night and day.  The Spectre, though still has some reflection, is very subdued.  The Yoga shows my face and every light source behind me.  Again, this is with tandem and touch.  From my view, there is no anti-reflective treatment whatsoever.  U.S. model.",
  "Per their specs, Lenovo uses the Dragontrail glass, which has an anti-reflective variant.  Corning Gorilla DX would have been another option.",
  "It's not patented, Samsung uses Corning DX. Its basically brands cheaping out by not going for Corning DX. Corning also has DX+. This tech has been available for YEARS.",
  "oh okay cool",

  "swear i've seen true black 1000 but now when i check it says true black 600, 500 nits brighnrss\n\nlmao. XD",
  "I really like it. I specifically wanted the Tandem OLED and it's great for watching HDR content after calibration. And unlike the Yoga Pro 9i which has 275H, the Yoga 7 has a 17watt low-power CPU that gives it much longer battery life. I get 8-9 hours browing multiple tabs. \n\nMy only gripe is 4 key rollover across Lenovo yoga series. 120Hz and Intel ARC grapgics are all great for playing high FPS games, except the keyboard doesn't register multiple presses very well.",

  "Asus ASUS ProArt P16 review. I think it's one of the best laptops in the market for creators. I've had the ProArt P16 review for almost 1 month now and I am impressed. It runs great, feels and runs like a premium device. I bought it for work and personal projects and I'm honestly happy with what I got. \n\nSpecs and Performance 10/10  - The P16 comes with an RTX4070 which is a solid graphics card. The CPU is AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 HX 370 which trumps and out performs the other top of the line CPU the intel ultra 9. The display is one of my favorite things about it, it's a 4K 16” 4K 60HZ OLED touchscreen. It can run anything and everything smoothly no matter what I'm doing. I can export high quality content faster then anything I've seen on my previous laptops. \n\nMUSETREE and ProArt Creator Hub 8/10 - Musetree has no subscription fees. Before I read that, i planned on ignoring the program. I have to say it's an amazing piece of software and I love that ASUS made it available. I've abandoned  programs like Riffusion and others in the same genre after trying out Musetree.\n\nI'm not a fan of the armory crate but thankfully Asus has the ProArt Creator hub to replace it and I think they did justice with it. While I don't recommend it for experienced veterans in the art and music industry. I do think it's good for beginners.\n\nLooks and graphics - The 4K OLED HDR display is beautiful and the image quality amazes me. I can work and focus on the tiniest details. Working with anything life like is another experience. The display really makes it worth it.  The speakers caught my attention. There are a total of 2 speakers, each built it to the sides of the keyboard. I was surprised at how good the sound is. Theres no distortion, no issues. It's feels almost perfect, like when and my friends go to the studio. \n\nBattery and cooling 9/10 - The P16 is at best warm. You can work all day without it getting hot. That being said, if you decide to game. It does get hot on the top side of the laptop. Above the keyboard and speakers. It is very noticeable to the touch. \n\nThe battery is pretty great for working, it will last you hours. If you decide to game... then it's just like any other gaming laptop when it comes to battery life.\n\n\n\nGaming and the display are fantastic on this laptop. I've never had a laptop that would boot up this fast, that would have 0 issues in every possible way when it came to working and gaming. Badly optimized programs and uncompressed videos are nothing when it comes to this laptop. and games run smooth, the experience is just on another level, and it is a future proofed laptop. Everything is so beautiful and on another level.\n\nThe P16 came with 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate that is NOT trial bound, so anyone can use it. \n\nTLDR - New owner of the ASUS ProArt P16  and had to share how amazing it and is and how much I have enjoyed it so far.\n\n\n\nThe model - ProArt P16 (H7606); Copilot+ PC - H7606WI",
  "it is *nearly* perfect. the glossy screen is not for creators. its for consumers. I contemplate returning it every day because of the super stupid reflections. It's unacceptable for creators. maddening because other than that it is spot-fucking-on Edit: one more thing, I liked the dial idea a generation back, this touchpad's halfway nonsense aint it.",
  "I'm really happy for you, lol kind of hate you for taking that pic like that though would love to see more of it.",
  "Damn, this looks sweet. Wonder if they have a 120Hz version",
  "I have mine for about a month now, loving how light it is when commuting. Programs run well but there’s a few little issues I came across. \n\nFirst week of using it I came across the blue screen of death but somehow it fixed itself.\n\nEvery time I unplug and run on battery the screen flickers on and off. \n\nThere’s been a few times the laptop turned off and took awhile to turn back on . Not sure what’s going on there.\n\nGames run well and the 60Hz does not bother me at all.",
  "Re: glossy screen, any matte screen guard won't work?",
  "I'm thinking about purchasing this laptop. I want to know if I connect this to an external monitor, and will it output at the monitors refresh rate? I'm aware the laptop is 60hz, but sure if connected to something like 144hz, the monitor will display in true 144hz?",

  "Yes the laptop screen is 60hz by default but what do you guys think about using this laptop with an external monitor with a higher refresh rate? In my case, I have a Odysee G9 OLED, would this laptop be able to push the 240hz 1440p in gaming?",

  "Any idea on if and when there will be a newer model released? I am about to purchase one of these (I am about 90% convinced currently) But I could easily wait another 6 months before I pull the trigger and I would rather have the latest and greatest as you don't buy laptops very often.",
  "I agree. As a photographer a glossy screen is a no go.",
  "Hey have you considered using a matte screen protector? I'm thinking of buying this but I'm not too sure now.",
  "I'm in between buying this now and waiting for the new version in 6-12mos (a guess).  I purchased a Zenbook and the amount of chrome tabs or digital assets I am viewing seems to push it to it's limits sometimes and disrupt my workflow. \n\nCurious if you'd recommend waiting for the new version or buying this one now? I'm mostly viewing, editing, download photos/videos for marketing and social media mgmt.",
  "Haha yeah it really does not show how thin it is. When I'm back home I'll snap a better picture.",
  "I always wish they’d get a few shots of the laptop then of the side of the box with specs.. so I can really round it out without looking up model numbers.",
  "No. The PX13 and P16 both have professional 3K/4k OLED screens that are capable of 100%+ color accuracy in every category. They don't make panels like that over 60hz unfortunately. Apparently when you raise the refresh rate on these panels, you lose color accuracy. These laptops are for photo and video editing, modeling, and other \"creative\" purposes first. Gaming is not their primary purpose. The Zephyrus G14 and G16 line is made for that.",

  "If you plugged the port thats directed to the dgpu, if flickers as the internal screen uses igpu, there would usually be another port not directed to the dgpu. (you can check this in nvidia control centre)",

  "Such a tough question. Truley a love/hate situation. I might sell this for a new one as well, but I fear they won't add any kind of appropriate MATTE display, which would be the only reason for me to do that. So, I don't think they will address the shortcomings unfortunately. And it is frustrating! Because the laptop is EXACTLY 87.3% PERFECT. The parts that are imperfect are so bad I want to throw it out the window. \n\n**As a Creator laptop:**\n\n**The Good:**\n\n- build quality \n\n- amount, type, and location of ports are perfect. should be standard.\n\n- 4k+ resolution, another thing that should be standard\n\n- battery life (once bloatware and g-helper are sorted)\n\n- led placement and purpose, surprisingly. \n\n- All the hardware is well thought out (yes I'm saying this twice, don't change it!)\n\n\n**The Bad:**\n\n- the touch version of the Aus Dial is beyond useless, it needs to be physical like the original. \n\n- The asus software is silly and bloated. they have around 9 apps and services that can be replaced by g-helper, thankfully.\n\n- The finish (I think there is only black?) is not only a fingerprint and dust magnet, it should be used in police forensics to collect dna. I have to wipe down before and after each use, sometimes with isopropyl. I have never had a laptop this bad (and I've owned a lot)\n\n**The Horrific (should be in prison for implementing):**\n\n\n- the glossy screen. It's a mirror. It WILL give you headaches. It is so bad matte screen protectors do nothing to dim the reflections.\n\n\n- The Soldered, unchangeable RAM. This is a pure cash grab by the industry (thanks apple c!nts), and for creators, it is cutting us off at the knees. \n\n\n- The MAX ram, the highest end unit is capped at 64gb.\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nAs a Gamer Laptop\n\n- Don't buy. look at razer and g14/16.\n\nEdit: My use case is 3d modeling/animation/photography/video editing/gaming/game design...

Even when I'm using something that relies on the dgpu when plugged in like Davinci, the flicker still happens. Used to be a few times a minute and now it's once every 5 minutes. Which adds up over the course of a few hours of work. I turned off V sync and that helped a lot but then affects my video editing though. \n\nMaking progress using everyone's recommendations and I won't return this laptop, but it's getting there.",
  "very important question, did you update bios to 3.12?",
  "Hi, no mine was 3.11. Updating to 3.12 right now",
  "Lenovo Yoga 7i Gen10, 14-inch laptop (2025) review **UK-based Laptop Review**\n\n**1. Title:**  \nLenovo Yoga 7i Gen 10 (2025) Review: power and portability\n\n**2. Introduction:**\n\nThis is a review for the 2025 yoga 7i gen 10 model from Lenovo with intel core ultra 7 258v and 14 inch screen. I bought the configuration from the UK Lenovo website with 32GB RAM, 1TB SDD, 2.8k OLED 120Hz screen, Luna Grey colour and optioned the fingerprint scanner for an additional £10, paying £1090 in total (including the 10% VIP discount for healthcare workers). This is a premium grade 2-in-1 consumer laptop with a solid build, great for anyone who needs a portable and powerful device.\n\nI haven’t seen many user reviews for this particular generation of laptop so thought it would be useful for anyone considering it.\n\n**3. Design and Build Quality:**\n\nThe chassis all metal, which gives it a very solid feel. The build quality is great, there’s very little flex in the case or the keyboard. The body does not pick up fingerprints. At 1.4kg, it’s not the lightest laptop but it’s still very portable. It fits my 13 inch laptop sleeve. I don’t have much use for the tablet mode as I find it too cumbersome when compared with holding an actual tablet. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and the trackpad is smooth and accurate. I appreciate the double height enter key. Coming from the LG gram 16, this is a much better typing and trackpad experience.\n\nPort selection is good. There are 2 USB-C ports, one on either side, with one USB-A, one full-sized HDMI, a microSD card slot and a headphone jack. The power key is on the right side which I’ve mis-pressed a couple of times so I’ve disabled it in the settings.\n\nThe display is a 14-inch glossy OLED touchscreen with 2.8K resolution (2880 x 1800), 500 nits brightness (1100 nits HDR Peak). I find the screen bright and vibrant. Watching video in a dimmed room is fantastic with zero light bleed. Reflections and fingerprints can be an issue, especially when viewing dark things on the screen and there is bright ambient. However it is still useable under these conditions.\n\nThe hinges are solid, with little screen wobble when typing but it does require two hands to open the lid. The look and feel of the laptop is very nice with smooth rounded outer edges.\n\n**4. Performance and heat:**\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 258v is perfectly capable of handling my usual tasks of multiple Chrome/ Firefox tabs, connecting to my remote desktop for work and steaming video content.  I have tried some gaming and the experience with casual  games has been very good. Fortnite runs at 120FPS. Cities Skylines runs great. I’ve tried playing Watchdogs and although it could play it, the framerates were only around 40fps and the processor got quite hot with the fans getting noisy.\n\nThe keyboard and palm rest areas are always cool. The area under the screen gets warm under load but the hot air is blown out through the vents on the back, away from the user which is a good design.\n\n**5. Audio and Webcam:**\n\nThe speakers are fine, they are up firing from the sides of the keyboard and they are rated for Dolby Atmos. I can clearly hear the 3D effects when watching YouTube or Netflix. There isn't much bass but it is acceptable for a thin and light laptop.\n\nThe 5M IR camera is decent for video conferencing. There is a privacy shutter switch just above the camera. Windows Hello usually takes just a few seconds to log me in. I have found the fingerprint scanner works faster, especially when the lighting conditions are not ideal for Windows Hello.\n\n**6. Battery Life:**\n\nThe 70WHr battery lasts all day for me when web browsing/ streaming videos. I use a 100W Ugreen 4-port USB C charger to charge all my devices and the laptop fully charges within a couple of hours.  \n\n**7. Software and User Experience:**\n\nThe OS is Windows 11 Home 64 and comes with some minor bloatware including McAffee Antivirus, Lenovo support/ vantage/ AI shenanigans. The Lenovo Vantage software has some useful features including dimming various parts of the screen to save battery – I only use the taskbar dimming though as I find the background dimming too distracting. It also enables you to switch the laptop on just by lifting the lid, which means the much maligned side power switch is hardly ever used. There have been reports of this power button breaking easily on other models and thus bricking the device.\n\n**8. Price and Value:**\n\nThe base model costs £1000 (£900 for students or those that qualify for VIP member) and comes with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and a14inch WUXGA OLED screen (1920x1200, 400nits, 60Hz). I was happy to pay the \\~£200 premium for the better spec’d screen with double the RAM and SSD. Mine came with a 65W USB-C charger and a stylus pen which magnetically attaches to the lid.\n\n**9. Pros and Cons:**\n\n* **Pros:** Screen, performance, battery life, keyboard\n* **Cons:** Screen reflections, power key positioning.\n\n**10. Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a well-built laptop where the pros far out-weigh the cons. The OLED screen is fantastic and it has been a pleasure watching content in a darkened room. It is very easy to travel with, having all-day battery life and a thin and light form factor.\n\n**Final Rating:** 9/10",
  "Really nice post.\n\nIm looking into this as pretty much the only option as the price is really good compared to others.\n\nIm sceptical about the hinges, but you say they are fine. And also if the performance is okay, if i could spec it id go higher but there arent really any options. \n\nThe next thing is vivobook which goes about 50% more with worse screen",
  "How about the weight, does it feel heavy...do you think it's worth the penny and do you think it's a good investment until 2028 atleast?",
  "Im setting up my 16 inch model right now and the fans are running on low constantly and high pitch too, did yours do the same?",
  "Hey, I am curious how did you opt for the fingerprint scanner. I can't find it in the configurations. Thanks.",
  "Potentially stupid question...\n\nI'm comparing different Lenovo Yoga 7s on their website,  and nowhere does it say which generation is which... How do you guys know this information?\n\nThere's so many reviews out there 😵‍💫",
  "I'm thinking of getting this laptop but I'm wondering about the CPU performance for things like python and matlab number crunching(data/optimization/small simulations etc)\n\nJust curious what kind of work do you do on it and is the CPU fast enough for that? I'm still not sure whether the lesser multicore compared to a 200H arrow lake is a problem or if I'm overthinking about the 258V",
  "hello, here some questions:\n1. what version of hdmi port does it have?\n2. What components could you upgrade? ssd, battery, keyboard?",
  "Just a question: does the screen have a plastic border, or is it all glass? ",
  "[removed]",
  "Hi OP, I read a few other reddit posts regarding poor battery life on this particular screen option (2.8K) compared to alot of the youtube reviews (which seems to be based on the 1200 screen option). When you say all day do you mean \\~7 hours? Are you leaving your screen on 120Hz or reducing it to 60Hz.",
  "Hi, I’ve used a Lenovo Yoga 7 AMD from a few generations back with the Ryzen 6800U for the past 3 years and have had no issues with the hinges for what it’s worth!",
  "Thanks. Only time will tell regarding the hinges but they look and feel sturdy to me and these double hinge designs should in theory spread the force out across the 4 contact points on each hinge, reducing the stress at any one point. I'll update if I have any problems with the hinges",
  "It doesn't feel heavy but it's not feather-light like the LG gram. The LG gram can be lifted from a corner with one hand easily whereas I'd struggle to do this with the Yoga 7i. The Yoga 7i   feels more substantial, more premium. However it is still easy to carry around in a back pack.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase so far - it does everything I need and I feel it is good value for what you get compared to an equivalent from HP or Apple. As long as I keep the battery in good condition and the hinges don't break, I'm sure it'll last a good 3-5 years. \n\nIf I didn't play PC games, I would have strongly considered a macbook air 13\".",
  "The 14 inch model doesn't have this problem at all. It's mostly silent. Your 16 inch model should have even better thermal handling given the extra space. The constant fans might be due to all the updates being installed, see how it goes",
  "It came up as an option for me when I selected luna grey as the colour",
  "https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-pro-series/lenovo-yoga-pro-7i-gen-10-aura-edition-14-inch-intel/len101y0058\n\nIt can be confusing. The UK lenovo website states which gen it is,  the i is for Intel, they usually have AMD in brackets for AMD models. X means snapdragon. I think the gen 10s are sometimes called Aura Edition too",
  "1. The HDMI port is a standard sized 1.4b\n\n2. The SSD can be upgraded via the M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe SSD slot but that's about it. The RAM is soldered on the model I got.",
  "There is a black border around the screen but the glass extends over it. The border houses the web cam",
  "I turned off the side power button and activated the open screen to switch on option which works really well. It means I never accidentally mis-press the power button and it should last a lot longer",
  " battery life has been fine for me, I've kept it at 120Hz and only charge up to 80%. Off power, I've been using it for 5 hours now, browsing/ streaming at 50% screen brightness and there's still 45% remaining, so that's just 35% battery use after 5 hours of light usage. I would expect at least 12 hours from a fully charged battery",
  "So pc games work on this one? How is the performance, which games did you try out and does it heat up?",
  "Do you still see that option? Cause I don't see it when I want to configure it",
  "Interesting... Yea the Canadian site doesn't mention generation. We have all those versions though.",
  "yea the cpu and size are all included in the full model name, but aura edition stands for the optimized intel partnerships versions that have slightly better battery life and perfs",
  "Is it possible to replace the keyboard?",
  "Awesome. Thank you ",
  "[removed]",
  "Whats the thought behind charging to 80% - does this extend overall battery life long-term?",
  "Yes, you can play PC games. Fortnite runs at 100-120FPS on the native screen resolution. Cities Skylines plays well.  I wouldn't expect to be able to run the latest AAA 3D intensive games well, but it can run most of them on low settings but I wouldn't recommend it for that as the fan noise gets quite loud if pushed too hard.",
  "Yes, it's still there as an option on the Lenovo UK website for the Lenovo Yoga 7i",
  "You would have to replace the entire assembly including touchpad",
  "I've used the laptop for a few months now and on the rare occasion that I do need to use the side power button (maybe twice so far), it's worked as it should. I think if the usage of the power button is so low, it should easily last the entire life of the laptop",
  "Yes, it's an option in the power management software to prolong battery health. It's standard practice for all lithium batteries",
  "Lenovo Yoga pro 7 i’m thinking of pulling the plug and buying the lenovo yoga pro 7. it’s for college and it kind of fits all my needs. i can get it for around $1200 cad and i don’t really know if it’s a good deal. Could i get something better for the same price or less or a bit more expensive? please let me know ",
  "Yoga Pros are solid ultrabooks, but whether it’s good for you depends on the exact specs of the laptop and what you are studying/doing/gaming/working on.\n\nwhat’s your field of study at uni? some degrees will require specific hardware, such as a graphics card, and not all of the Yoga Pro models have discrete GPUs which brings up the earlier question about specs.",
  "It's a bit heavy for my tastes at over 3.5 lbs, but it seems like a decently compact powerhouse.\n\nAnother system to consider is the Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition. It's an Intel Lunar Lake machine, about 2.75 lbs, Arc graphics, up to 32 GB of RAM. It's cheaper, and would have a better battery life, but the Arc graphics are slower than the 3050.",
  "mechanical engineering. i do plan to get a desktop with a better gpu in the future but the yoga pro 7 has a ryzen 7 8845hs and 3050",
  "i have been looking at that but it’s pretty much out of stock everywhere i’ve looked. i would get the 4060 of the pro 7 but i can’t find it either",
  "that configuration should be enough for your degree. it’s very unlikely you’ll need more than the 3050 for your undergrad.",
  "Can't help you there. It was in stock on Lenovo.com, but that's pricey. I got mine new on ebay with the full manufacturer warranty for $799 (256V model)",
  "okay that’s good. i see so much 3050 hate online so i thought it wasn’t really worth it😅",
  "well, it’s objectively an underpowered and limited discrete card. the hate is warranted, especially for the desktop variants which are extremely poor performance for the price you pay. **it’s a terrible option if your goal is to play video games**. \n\nits use case is different for laptops and students. for what the 3050 lacks in performance, it makes up for in being a very efficient card that draws very little power. in a laptop, you don’t necessarily want a powerful, power-hungry card that heats up like crazy and drains the battery life in 5 seconds. all laptop card variants are much worse than their desktop counterparts, anyways.\n\nfor you specifically, having a discrete GPU at all is largely beneficial for CAD software and other modeling software. sometimes, these softwares require a discrete GPU to even function properly. \n\na laptop is where a 3050 probably shines brightest. for more context, the 3050 is one of the few relatively modern cards that has a model without a power cable. there’s a low-profile desktop GPU 3050 that draws a max of only 50W and is powered solely through the PCIe connector. cool stuff.",
  "that does make a lot of sense. thanks for the clarification, i mainly wanted something with a dgpu but most laptops with them are heavy and loud",
  "slight update. i just found an omen 14 with an ultra 7 155h and a 4060 for $1300 and i might be going with that because it literally better in every way?",
  "it is a much higher performing laptop for sure in every aspect. like I said, the Yoga Pro is enough for your degree, but the Omen 14 is a gaming laptop and you could legitimately use it to game in many modern titles as well.",
  "okay thanks for the clarification. i might as well get the omen then but ive heard the battery is terrible",
  "it’s a gaming laptop with a powerful CPU. the H model Intel Ultra chips have more cores and faster clock speeds which draws significantly more power. once again, the Yoga Pro is better for battery life and it’s more than enough for your studies, but the Omen is a powerful gaming laptop. its first and foremost built for gaming, which you will never do on battery anyways.",
  "What do you think about the new Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Gen 10?  Ryzen AI 7 350, OLED and 32Gb RAM for 900€ ",
  "I have one but with sadly a ryzen 7 7735hs and not an AI 7 350. But I have all maxed out options.\n\nIt's an absolute BANGER of a laptop. It's very light and thin, build quality is pretty good and the OLED is really bright. \n\nPerformance wise it performs as you'd expect from the specs as far as mine is concerned, but i can't tell for the RAI7 version obviously. \n\nKeyboard is good as well. The integrated microphone is *extremely* good for a laptop, hands down best laptop mic I've heard. I'm running Linux on it, it's very well supported and everything works as expected except the mic which needs a kernel edit to work (I've sent a patch a month or so ago, but i think it got forgotten :/ )\n\nIn the bios you can dedicate from 256mb to 4gb to the igpu. However the bios is fairly limited in terms of what you can do in it.\n\nNow that I know the ryzen ai 7 version exists I'm sad I didn't wait :( \n\nOh and one last thing, at least with mine I bundled a 2year accidental damage warranty for 35€ which is nice, idk if that's still available but it's a nice to know.",
  "[removed]",
  "I got the Ideapad Pro 5 version, I believe Slim is a bit less sturdier. That cpu is slightly better than the 8845HS, but the graphics are worse (780M>860M). Screen is absolutely gorgeous. I would recommend mine, this one probably is also fine (If it has 2.8K 120hz oled, if it doesn’t then an Ideapad Pro 5 would be better in this case)",
  "does it have a haptic trackpad? I can't stand the trackpad on the yoga aura 15 edition",
  "Hi, I just ordered mine ;)  \nSpent some time comparing and looking through different laptops and ended up filtering the lenovo PSREF.  \nthe fact it has  \n\\- 2\\*SODIMM RAM (user swappable DDR5)  \n\\- 2\\*M.2 SSD Slots (2242 preinstalled, 2280 free) => added a 110€ 2TB  WD\\_Black SN7100  \n\\- full aluminium body (unlike previous ideapads)  \n\\- oled   \n\\- the newest gen ryzen with Ai dedicated core architecture  \n\\- 2\\* USB-A + 2\\*USB-C  \nwere my reasons to got for it.

  "Hy , can u provide the link ,\nAnd is the storage upgradable?",
  "You get a think pad for same price but base ram",
  "Is the one you have with amd radeon 660m version? Im looking to buy this model for around 700 euros where I live. I really want a portable lightweight laptop with a nice oled screen, I only play Runescape which is like a 20 year old mmo. And mainly gonna use it for multimedia like youtube and netflix.",
  "what about the hinges? i've read bad reviews about it",
  "Hi man, I am considering buying the same laptop, I would like to know how’s the battery life? Do you have the 13” or 15” inch one? Thank you",
  "Hey mate, i got the same one , waiting for delivery. In this price range I doubt you get anything better.\nHow is the fan noise? I'm a little worried as there are so many people complaining about it and even returning it. Cheers",
  "could you tell me how to increase igpu allocation? I got mine with 24 GB of ram specifically so I wouldn't struggle on light games like minecraft and it's coming in a month or so but I wanna know how to do it",
  "How is it with casual gaming like Roblox and others in the same level? Even if I wouldn't go for AAA gaming I might go for it takes two. Do you think it could run those?",
  "hi, how's going today after 5 months? would you still recommend it? I'm planning to get a 15\" Ideapad Slim 5 with 7735hs and 16/512Gb with an IPS display for 680€.",
  "Have you every noticed any PWM flicker when using it on low brightness?",
  "You're Australian I believe",
  "jesus christ i dont even know what to say..",
  "How's the battery life? I'll use it for programming and/or heavy browser-work",
  "Hey, I am considering getting one myself. Got the Gen 9 just a couple of weeks ago for my wife, and for the price it's really great.\n\nJust wanted to add, that the ram is soldered, not swappable by the user as u stated. Check the Lenovo Product website. It was soldered in Gen 9 as well. You can change the SSD(s) and the Wifi Card. Gen 9 only had one ssd slot for 2242 btw. So that's definately a plus having 2 now.\n\nAh and btw, it has 2 USB-C 40 gbit ports, just like Gen 9 did. From the Lenovo Product Website \"Ports2 x USB-A (USB 3.2 Gen 1) + 2 x USB-C (USB4, 40Gbps, DP2.1, PD3.0) + 1 x Novo Button + Audio Jack + HDMI 2.1\"\n\n\nEdit, sorry. Thought you guys were talking about Ideapad 5 Pro 14.... ",
  "same! what did u end up going with?",
  "Thinkpads are just not worth it brand new, stop recommending those. They’re just absolute trash for their price. Lenovo is surfing on their name.",
  "r7735hs has rx680m",
  "They're fine as of now, they don't feel too flimsy unlike some HP or MSI pos, but they're not the strongest hinges ever compared to the ones of an xps or high end thinkpad. Not super good, not bad, just okay",
  "Hii\n\nIf you're on linux the cpu won't even go above 40°c for general desktop use so the fan won't even spin. It's however not the quietest if you're loading the cpu hard (compiling code, virtual machines or heck even games since the 680m can game pretty well), but nothing too terrible. \n\nOverall on linux it's not even making any noise for most tasks.\n\nAnd yeah, you're not getting anything better for that kind of money. I recommend getting the fat (70wh battery) for best experience.",
  "It's in the bios is dont recall the settings name but you'll find it easily",
  "Is the ram upgradable upto 32 gigs ?",
  "Yeah for sure, the radeon 680m is more than capable for those. But I'd suggest getting an actual gaming laptop if you're only doing gaming.",
  "Hi,\n\nYeah for sure. Still a great laptop. I'd recommend getting the OLED screen if your budget allows for it, it's really worth it in my opinion. Also since the memory is non upgradable getting the 32 gigs of ram is not a bad idea either (and if you can't get both the oled and the ram, get the ram) especially if you're running windows",
  "[removed]",
  "Something around 5-8 hours ? I get 5 because I’m always on HDR at 120hz with the ram set to 7500MT/s (they added a setting in the bios to change it), but I remember getting closer to 7 hours before I did all that, even 8. So with web browsing and programming it’ll last you half a day maybe. It also charges pretty pretty fast.",
  "hi, can you explain why? i've seen a lot of people recommending thinkpads, so i was considering it",
  "hey, could you tell me if the hinges have held up. i have had lenovos before and the hinges are awful , they usually fail in 1-2 years.",
  "Thanks for the detailed reply.\nI'm on Windows. Hopefully it's gonna be manageable, im pretty sensitive to loud fan noise especially for no reason ... Have a good day",

  "Hello, i want to buy a YOGA with either a 256v or a ryzen ai 350, i want a good battery life. i mainly want to use the laptop for websufring and media consumption (streaming and local), which would be the good choice ? thanks",
  "Old ones okay maybe if decently priced. Problem are new ones, being super overpriced while offering very little. An example : A mid range T14 G5 with a core ultra 5 125U, 60hz 1200p sRGB IPS display, 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage, which for those two are getting below today's standard, is priced at 1200€. Those are specs you'd find on a 600-700€ laptop, not a 1200€ laptop. At 1000€ you can already get something well built with a Ryzen 7 8th gen, 32gb of ram and 1tb of storage (Asus Zenbook, HP Elitebook, etc). In this case that laptop OP showed was a pretty fine deal, but if you took a Thinkpad for the same price you'd have an E14 Gen 6 with even worse specs. They stay good, don't get me wrong : but at any price range there's pretty much always a better deal.",
  "They still good",
  "Unfortunately windows randomly spikes the cpu even on idle so a same pc can sometime run *MUCH* hotter on Windows...\n\nBut im confident it wont be too bad, just not as good as on linux.",
  "Keyboard's alright. As for the burn in, I think it'll be fine, especially if you don't run max brightness (the screen is very bright, even half brightness is much brighter than most laptop screens) and auto hide taskbar. Bonus point if you use a OLED friendly theme (iirc the O365 suite has one where the background and ui is pure black). Those are only preventive measures and not really 100% necessary unless you're really scared.",
  "Yeah, I think it’ll perfectly suit your use. You can even play games on it like Fortnite at native res with amd adrenaline’s capper on 75 at 70 fps, Minecraft at 100 fps, the 780M is great.",
  "The AI 350 is slightly better, but the 256v does it all at 17W. Normally the Intel one should have better battery life. Will very easily handle what you said, even some more intensive tasks like gaming.",
  "Hi dear, how about the fan noise? Do you often hear them?",
  "Strangely it's hard to find an 8845hs or 8840u ddr5, good battery life + screen laptop here in India without overpaying a lot. \nBut I found an almost equally good Ryzen 7 AI 350 laptop with 860M igpu, 32 GB ddr5 5600 MT, 60wh fast charge. I think that'll be almost equally good as your laptop?",
  "so the intel would be the better choice ? between it doesn't have the multi threading capabilities, that's why i hesitate",
  "The ai 7 350 has a weaker iGPU but is normally slightly better than the 8845hs, would be close or even better since it also consumes less.",
  "Eh, won’t affect much.",
  "Laptop comparison: Zenbook14 (amd) vs Yoga slim 7 intel vs Yoga slim 7 gen 10(amd) I just graduated and am planning on buying my second laptop. I am considering either a ZenBook from Asus or Yoga from Lenovo. I will probably receive a work laptop so I need a laptop for normal browsing, maybe upskilling, movies and I play Genshin Impact consistently. once in a while i might play valorant, basically light gaming. I would prefer a 16GB RAM and 1TB storage. 512GB is also fine if other features are good. looking for a laptop with OLED Screen.\n\nI have 3 options that I really like:\n\n**1. ZenBook 14 OLED(2025) :  89,990 Rs**  \n[ZenBook 14 OLED](https://in.store.asus.com/ai-powered-light-weight-laptop-asus-zenbook-14-um3406ka-pp240ws.html)\n\nI really like this laptop and wanted a ZenBook for quite some time. I love everything about this laptop - the color, build, display quality. The amd version of this was released in India a few days ago. It has Ryzen AI 5 340 Processor which i know is quite good. Only downside is its 1TB Version is not yet available in India and I am not sure if it will be released any time soon too. I will have to pay extra for warranty too.\n\n**2.

But the display of this laptop is not as good as ZenBook. looks wise i like ZenBook more but this is pretty good too. If i customize this laptop then the cost increases as:\n\n* \\+4000Rs Warranties that are automatically added \n* \\+2000Rs Microsoft office extra\n* \\+4900Rs for 1TB Storage\n* \\+4200Rs for Ryzen AI 7 350\n* \\+3850Rs for *35.56cms (14) 2.8K (2880 x 1800), OLED, Glare, Non-Touch, HDR 1000 True Black, 100%DCI-P3, 1100 nits (HDR Peak)/500 nits (SDR Typical), 120Hz*\n\nThe cost might go upto 93k - 99k depending on the combo.

  "Is this Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 the right price? Hi,\n\nI am about to place an order for this laptop and I would like to hear from those of you more in touch with the laptop market if this looks like a good price for the configuration below:\n\nLenovo Ideapad Slim 3 15AHP10\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS\n\nRAM: 16GB DDR5 5600MHz (dual channel)\n\nStorage: 1TB SSD M.2\n\nDisplay: 15.3\" IPS, 1920x1200 (WUXGA)\n\nBacklit keyboard\n\nBattery: 60 Wh\n\nPrice in EUR: €600\n\nI haven't bought a laptop in many years, as I mainly work and play on a desktop, but I wanted something relatively compact to take with me while traveling this summer, maybe even do some remote work away from the heat of the big city, play an occasional game, nothing too demanding (Skyrim-level games, so to speak)..., yet not too small (14\") either, as I work with documents and text and I do need some decent display area.\n\nAre there other good choices in this price range? I wouldn't spend more for a laptop that would only complement my main desktop system and would only be used while away from my home office.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\nUPDATED post to attach pictures of the one I got:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wgc7pxeovfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53e00558e4cfeada5b062bb88af2c658d8afb3a7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zouejseovfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2608043c183416bc91f1b4e53ecb51e4e36b869\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ks70seovfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=441845193ce0c9d6e918fca80c70abd2ac9cc18f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usfu6seovfhf1.jpg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d58cb129c9f2b934621a7f7ab9c32f42c4c888e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddcubseovfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbbffacd3c18d6f7688383fda4b13cdb84dc32e1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpywsyeovfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b33101e74d288e2ad90e7441717aad31d48803b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p759nveovfhf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0000e4ab1b9a1e366b6dce7c5d9c8c520138bdf8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sqxr2teovfhf1.jpg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd3a4fc9932b78becb0ac618f9b8b535c9240e14\n\n",
  "There will be some awesome sales this black friday so watch out for those!",
  "Trust me, forget about Lenovo Ideapad, the display is horrible. All yellowish and blurred text.",
  "I think for that price you may be able to go up to slim 5 or even pro 5 if youre lucky. Same cpu, try to score more ram too.",
  "TBH I'd recommend Vivobooks over Ideapads 1 or 3 because Lenovo seriously cheaps out on build quality with these, I have a stack of them with dead hinges, one got fried motherboard",
  "Did you end up buying this? I am thinking about buying it myself because its specs at this price feels very value for money. I don't care about gaming myself either. What is your experience so far?",
  "What's the vram of this igpu . Can we increase igpu v ram  from bios",
  "This device is not at all value for money, The Ideapad when overloaded with work tends to slow down and lag, creating a horrific experience for the user and also it starts heating after heavy usage and the battery also drains quickly. The processor is the thing that need to be improved.",
  "I was thinking about buying the similar 24gb variant with 50whr battery for 60k Rs which is nearly €578.I wanted to ask about the display which is 45% Ntsc. Recently bought Ideapad slim 5 gen 10 which is awesome. It has 100% sRGB. So I was wondering how bad is 45%NTSC? And also what games can you play at max experience",
  "im looking buy a laptop mostly for uni, the Ryzen 5, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD version is available for £450, is it worth it?",
  "Hello, im thinking to buy the same one as yours. Could you give me some informations about the battery life and how long it lasts on normal use?",
  "Hey I know it's an older post but how is the laptop holding up so far?",
  "You are right, I had a chance to look at it in person at a local showroom, first of all it is just too dim. At 300 nits it still seems dimmer than my Dell desktop monitor only rated 250 cd/m² / nits.\n\nWhat do you recommend for better display quality? I don't need OLED, just a good decently accurate and colorful IPS.",
  "I avoided a 2-in-1 for the same reason, as I had been reading about the issues with their hinges; are the regular non 2-in-1s just as bad? \n\nI had a chance to see the Slim 3 today in a showroom and it feels kind of flimsy.. the keyboard is nothing like the ThinkPads I owned, it feels soft/rubberized, with a lot of flex.. the keyboard is almost level with the laptop's surface, not enough travel for good feedback.. I'm considering a Thinkpad, even if with a less powerful CPU, but I haven't seen the newer generations, they may just as well not be the same quality as the older ones...",
  "Hi,\n\nYes, I ended up buying it because I could no longer bear all the browsing and comparing and reading reviews... :)\n\nI had used Thinkpads before, and a year ago I had bought the Ideapad 1 for my daughter to use as her first laptop in school, so I was not totally unfamiliar with Lenovo laptops.\n\nWhat can I say, it is kind of what I expected, build quality seems decent, with an aluminium lid, solid plastic/PCB for the rest of the body, and yes, it is very slim, at least compared to what I had been used to. It doesn't look cheap, I got it in Luna Grey, and it's a very nice metallic color, making it look more expensive than it is.\n\nThe display is the regular WUXGA 1920x1200 which for me is perfect in such a compact form factor (it is a 15.3\" display - which I appreciate for portability, while still offering plenty of space for work thanks to its 16:10 ratio). It is \"only\" 300 nits bright, some people complained about it being too dim for them, but I found it perfectly fine, I use it comfortably at 70-75% brightness (my desktop Dell monitor is only 250 nits and it it is still bright enough!)\n\nPerformance-wise it is as expected from a Ryzen 7 8840HS - snappy in all tasks, it won't get hot with regular office work, browsing, watching videos, etc. So far, so good. The fan only starts with some heavy multitasking, such as downloading and installing a large game while also running online tv in the background and working in Office at the same time... but even so, the fan is not loud at all, you can barely hear it.\n\nI've tested it in some games too, again.. it performs as expected, the integrated Radeon 780M is excellent for \"laptop gaming\", it runs games like Syrim, Fallout New Vegas, etc. perfectly smooth in 1080p (or 1200p for that matter). Of course the very slim case is not optimal for cooling, so for extended gaming, even moderate, I would suggest an additional cooler pad/stand. \n\nOtherwise, I'm pretty happy with it, no issues so far.. if I were to be really picky, I'd say the keyboard could be better, it feels a bit soft for my taste, somewhat rubbery. But the backlight is really useful in dark conditions, and I knew I shouldn't expect a \"Thinkpad level keyboard\". I often work on an external monitor, using an external keyboard, so that is not a serious issue for me anyway.\n\nShortly after I bought it, the price was discounted and I could have gotten the 24GB RAM version instead of the 16GB version, for the same price, but I didn't bother trying to return it and order the one with more RAM, I intend to upgrade it to more than 24GB anyway. I intend to add a 32GB DDR5 stick (in addition to the 8GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard) - a total of 40GB should be plenty for the next few years - the added RAM will really be necessary (especially with the integrated GPU), so I would recommend getting the one with more RAM if you don't plan to upgrade it yourself later.\n\n(I would post photos, but I don't think it's possible here.)",
  "The max it can use is 4GB, I don't think you can change that in BIOS (I don't remember seeing any options related to vram allocation). \n\nIn the meantime I upgraded mine to 24GB RAM (8 soldered + a 16GB DDR5 5600MHz stick). Running Task Manager I can see there are always a total of 20GB available for system, thus the rest of 4GB is reserved for the GPU, which is allocated dynamically in games as needed (you can see all those stats live using the in-game overlay provided by the AMD Adrenalin software).",
  "It's not a heavy duty workstation, it's not meant to be \"overloaded\" with work. For regular office work, for students and even for some light-medium gaming it does work well, it doesn't feel sluggish at all. After all, it is an 8 cores, 16 threads, 5.1 GHz boost clock CPU! And the RAM is DDR5 running at 5600MHz! So it's by no means a slow machine, but you really have unrealistic expectations, what does \"value for money\" mean in this case? The performance of a $3,000 laptop in one that costs $600?\n\nThere are two battery versions available for this model, I went for the higher capacity one (60Whr). Coupled with a low TDP of the CPU (only 28W!), the battery really lasts more than many laptops I owned before.",
  "It depends... which Ryzen 5 CPU? The \"U\" versions of the Ryzen 5 CPUs are cheaper (but also slower, such as Ryzen 5 5625U).\n\nAnd what display? The regular IPS lcd, OLED...?\n\nBut £450 seems a bit expensive, for instance I found this configuration online in my country for about £350 (with further 10% off these days):\n\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15ARP10\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 7533HS (up to 4.4GHz)\n\n15.3\" WUXGA, IPS\n\n16GB DDR5\n\n512GB SSD\n\nI'm pretty sure it does the job for uni, office work, etc.\n\n  \nP.S> Oh, and do go for the highest RAM version (I think they come with a maximum of 24GB), it will help a lot for the future, even if all you do is regular work and study, Windows itself and other software are becoming more and more demanding in terms of memory. The price difference is not that much.\n\n#",
  "Hi, mine is the 60 Wh battery (they larger capacity one) and while I haven't used it exclusively on battery yet, from full to empty, it always shows an estimate of 6-7 hours when I unplug it at full charge. It automatically switches to another power plan for better battery life, which you can adjust further manually for even more battery saving, but I guess it also depends on what kind of work you're doing on your laptop while running on battery and the brightness you set for the display. I'd say you can definitely rely on approximately 6 hours of normal office work, browsing, etc. No gaming on battery, obviously.",
  "I only use it occasionally, when I travel or when I spend the weekend away from home and so. No issues so far, it is (obviously) faster than my desktop's i5-9500 / 32GBRAM and I've even played some games, I happy with the performance and the compact size. I've adjusted the display colors to a cooler temperature as the \"built-in\" blue light protection makes the colors slightly too warm by default.",
  "Honestly I really don't know. Everythime it is a surprise when you switch on a new PC. Acer Aspire was good but I have been struggling since the beginning with Touchpad glitches, often it does not work. I think I will give up with PC and buy a Mac At least it lasts forever and no surprises.",
  "Just as bad, the hinges in Ideapads 1 and 3 are painfully weak, also tbh not that many laptops can compare to Thinkpad in terms of reliability. You probably should go with some thinkpad if your budget is limited and under 500$\n\nIf you take T or P Thinkpads, they'll serve you good, new or old ones",
  "Am also in same situation,  I shortlisted this an  Thinkpad with R77735HS",
  "Thanks for taking the time to write this, you really covered everything. I'm also, tired of searching, comparing models and reading reviews... I think I'll buy this one after all, it's also on discount (549€).",
  "Thanks so much for the detailed answer!",
  "i was looking for reviews of this product everywhere, thanks for this. i am also looking at the 24 ram variant.",
  "Hi man thanks for the review.About Display did you find it to have a yellowish tint as many say?!",
  "Hi, the display does show a slightly warm/yellowish tint overall, particularly noticeable with reds - they look somewhat orange, I suspect it's the so called blue light filter built in, but I used the Adrenalin software for the integrated GPU and managed to get reasonably neutral/cooler colors, it now looks similar to my desktop monitor, but if you are a perfectionist, you may need to invest more. But to me, it's not a bad display at all.",

  "Asus ProArt P16 4070 64gb review I've had the ProArt P16 for about a week now and I figured as the information out there is mostly focused on the p13 some people might find this helpful.\n\n(skip ordering if you don't want to see a ramble about what a shit show it was)\n\n**ordering**:  \nMassively lackluster communication in Europe. absolutely no launch day or information regarding the official launch day for any of the ProArt line, just the zenbooks which use the lower clocked AI 300 chips. I got a notification at 1 am on the 27th that they are now available to order for delivery on  the 28th. ordered at 3 am because I happened to be awake, and then the order sat as \"processing\"for over a week. I contact the email support line twice and never heard back, after 5 days, decided to call. first positive part of this is that the phone maybe rang twice and I was immediately talking to a support agent which is very rare in the UK, lovely chap assured me he would follow up on what was holding up the order by the end of the day. never heard back. called again, and again was very promptly talking to a human and he saw the warehouse hadn't answered the first support reps request for an update, and said he would get to the bottom of it, but to wait another 4-5 days til he could guarantee a response. Around 10pm I received an email saying that the order has been \"completed\" and on the order page it gave me a ups tracking number that couldn't be found. At the same time I got an email from the rep I had spoken to earlier in the day confirming that the order had been shipped out and he gave me a different tracking number with a different service which showed it had actually been dispatched that morning before I had called the 2nd time. Overall I'm pretty unimpressed by their entire handling of a product launch for such a premium product, but I'm guessing they just don't care as a more budget focused brand, and they likely don't see the volume on their ProArt line to justify giving more of a toss.\n\nso the shit out of the way, lets get to the product.\n\n**Specs**:  \nCPU: Ryzen AI HX 370 (12 core, 4 p, 8 e)  \nRAM: 64GB LPDDR5 7500  mhz (although I'm getting some strange numbers, sometimes seeing 8400-8500 mhz)  \nGPU: Nvidia 4070 8gb running at PCIe x8 gen 4  \nDisk: 2TB WD SN740 (1.86 usable) (get full speeds, so running on x4 gen 4)  \nDisplay: 4k @ 60hz oled (\\*sad womp noises\\*)\n\n**Form Factor**:  \nGod damn is this thing thin and light. I'm replacing a razor blade 17 and its extremely noticeable at roughly half the weight. Additionally, I've been looking around fro something that can be solely charged with USB C as I'm tired of lugging around several bricks to charge all of my devices, but the power brick supplied is actually remarkably slim and light, making it the first brick I actually wouldn't hate to lug around with me.\n\n**Screen**:  \nbeautiful screen, completely ruined by being possibly the most reflective screen I've ever seen on any monitor. invest in a screen protector with some sort of matte finish because if you run in dark theme, your screen is basically a mirror.\n\n**Touch Pad**:  \nvery nice, only comment is that I have to learn how to hold my hands differently as I frequently move the mouse around and select random bits of text as I type. love the dial, but they really need to work on the palm rejection. Currently I have windows set to disable the trackpad if I have a mouse connected as randomly selecting half the document and overwriting it is annoying.\n\n**Sound**:\n\nspeakers are easily the best I've ever had on a windows laptop and my partner and I really struggled going back and forth comparing it to her 15\" Macbook Air. the air sounds more tinny, but reproduces the balance better at high volumes, where the P16 delivers a much fuller sound, but crowds the vocals at high volume leading to a muddier mix, still I was absolutely blown away by the performance and I had a similar feeling to the first time putting on my HD800s in terms of emotional surprise at the audio fidelity (its obviously not nearly as fine tuned at the HD800's, but with some tuning software, they are extremely good.)\n\n**Fan Noise**:  \nsignificantly louder than most reviewers would have you believe, but it only kicks in if you're playing games at full resolution, max graphics. otherwise its a very slight whisper. even doing several benchmarks didn't even kick on the fans. normal use/ web browsing will be virtually silent. but boy does it take off when gaming.\n\n**Thermals**:  \nnot gaming: you have a laptop.  \ngaming: after 40-50 minutes of pushing the system, upper middle of the keyboard (think the \"6\" key) becomes uncomfortably warm. laptop conveniently converts to \"passive vasectomy\" mode soon after.\n\n**Performance**: (the only thing we really care about)\n\n**Benchmarks**:\n\n**Speedometer**: couldn't get above a 20, quite disappointed with that, but realistically have not noticed even a stutter on anything and I don't necessarily give a lot of stock in a browser based benchmark as there is about a million things that could affect this score.\n\n**Cinebench 2024**:  \nsingle-core: 116  \nmulti-core: 1155  \nGPU: 11038  \nmuch happier with these results, actually beating out each of the systems in my compute cluster which consists of servers running a mix of Threadripper 1950x and Ryzen 5950x, both of which have more cores, all of which are full power cores, which makes the multi-core score even more impressive.\n\n**PassMark**:  \n[https://www.passmark.com/baselines/V11/display.php?id=216744032991](https://www.passmark.com/baselines/V11/display.php?id=216744032991)  \nhonestly kind of surprised the memory score is so low as AFAIK, its absolutely crushing basically any laptop and the vast majority of desktops when you compare the actual benchmark numbers (also intel seems to do almost 2x as well on the same chips over amd, but this is still competing with the top speed intel results, yet still very low overall score)\n\nalso their graphics scores are mega low due to the screen being limited to 60 fps, so tbh this is kinda a crap test.\n\n**Geekbench**:  \n[https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/7300199](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/7300199)  \nagain very nice single and multi-core scores.\n\n**Gaming**:  \nso far its pretty much run everything I have thrown at it with full graphics at native resolution without much complaint. The benefit of the 60 fps limit on the screen means we don't have any high expectation, and it easily handles basically anything up to that 60 fps.\n\n**Battery Life**:  \nlooking at maybe 9:30-10 hours of light use. haven't tested gaming without being hooked up to the wall, because well, whats the point.\n\n**final thoughts**:  \nVery capable machine and I am happy with the sunk cost.  \nAsus could work a little on communication, but the product delivers.  \nthe 60 fps screen has been the only minor gripe, but it looks like the G16 is being released with basically the same specs but a 144hz monitor, so might go with that.  \nAsus for the love of god put an anti-glare coating on your screens.\n\n**most underrated feature: it seems that the sleep mode bug in windows doesn't affect these cpus. in over a week no phantom awakens in the backpack and I even left it off for the weekend and it only lost about 3% battery over 3 days.**",
  "\"looking at maybe 9:30-10 hours of light use.\"\n\nIs the a guestimate, or real-world numbers you have witnessed? because I am only seeing 5-7 hours of web/video on mine unfortunately. \n\n\"Asus for the love of god put an anti-glare coating on your screens.\"\n\nFUCK YES. I look at my reflection more than images on the screen. it's bonkers reflective for a \"Creator\" laptop.\n\nI agree with everything you mentioned in your review. thanks for posting.",

Just using browser, downloading a 1.6gb file, decided to switch wifi to 5g while trying to connect I got the blue screen. Not too excited about this.\n\nRestarted. Tried switching to 5g wifi and it happened again. Something must be up with the wifi device in the laptop. Hope its just drivers. Though at first launch I did have to run a large windows update.",
  "Do you visually notice the touchscreen layer, especially on bright backgrounds?\n\nI've had this problem with most high-res touchscreen laptops where the touch layer grid is just super annoying for my eyes (especially when it's that diagonal grid), and yet finding a glass OLED laptop without touch has been challenging.",
  "u/ClassyBukake Thank you for the review of the P16.  It convinced me to pick one up.  I grabbed the RTX 4060 model and so far I'm loving it.  The battery life is amazing compared to my Razer Blade.  Do you experience the screen dimming after about a minute of idle time?  No matter what my settings are it will dim.  I assume it's to protect the OLED, but I would love to disable it.  Any thoughts?",
  "u/ClassyBukake for the love of god what about Adobe Creative Cloud apps? This is a creator laptop, being able to game doesn't necessarily mean it will perform good with Adobe CC. Not a single word about creator use. How does it perform with Adobe apps under heavy use? Any stutters?",
  "I am looking at the P16, but am worried that the 8GB VRAM of the rtx4070 won't be enough for Unreal engine (especially running the Citysample). Can you comment on 4k editing or software like Unreal Engine or blender?",
  "Just here to drop my opinion.\n\nTL;DR; it looked like a cheap and low quality copy of the m16.\n\nI have seen the ProArt P16 at Bestbuy and I think it's lacking in terms of looks, It looks kinda generic it doesn't have any strong design language. when I first saw it, it was open and I didn't know I was looking at an Asus, I honestly thought that some one was trying to make a knock off M16, I realized after I saw the dial pad that it might be an Asus, that was when I had to check around to confirm.  \nI have nothing to say about performance as I just saw it in passing and I didn't have the time to try any games or benchmark.",

  "Hi, I've recently bought a P16 4070 64GB, and beside few initial problems with Windows (I had to recover the OS 3 times... ffs...) and the included Ethernet dongle that wasn't working 90% of the times, it's been a pretty nice laptop, the only complain that I have (beside a little coil whine while plugged to the charger, both while working and while turned off) are the fans... they sound like they're constantly going up and down every couple of seconds when in \"Standard\" power mode, and the System fan is constantly above 3700 RPM, which makes it a bit annoying; but most of all, the GPU fan sounds like an old HDD when it starts to spin, is it normal? Also, the CPU fan made a cracking noise once, but after a couple gentle hits with one finger on the rear of the laptop, it stopped... should I bring it to an Asus centre to have it checked? I'm a bit worried they'll do more damage than good...",

I'm mainly using Chrome with white backgrounds haven't had done a lot of work in Unreal yet, but curious your thoughts on the screen at this point months later?\n\nI looked into a matte screen protector but couldn't find one that seemed well recommended - seen risks of either negatively impacting the image, and/or risking air bubbles on application (high difficulty level basically)",
  "u/ClassyBukake Hi, I am considering buying this laptop for music production and one of the uses I wanted to give it was the recording of vocals in my home studio, and for that the fan noise is very important to me, because if it is too loud it can sneak through the microphone.

  "I took it into work yesterday without the brick, popped it into eco mode and worked about 6:30-7 hours and still had ~35% left when I packed up. Now in this case I was remote desktopping into a dev cluster was literally standing next to, so it was just decoding a 2k video stream using h.264, which Even a 6 watt pico board can do at 60 fps, so very light workload.\n\nI could see if you were doing a lot of heavy multithreaded workloads, it would probably last a lot less, but so far I have yet to reach the point of charger anxiety. Maybe I'll do some more comprehensive testing if anyone actually gives a toss, but my workloads are largely reinforcement learning, coding, and random bits of fuckery, so probably will absolutely shitbrick my battery life stats due to the near constant 100% cpu and GPU utilization.",
  "The right USBC port and hdmi port are assigned to the DGPU.\n\nThe left side USBC port does DP from the IGPU.",
  "It will as long as you're not running games off of it. Then you're almost certainly gonna be drawing more power than it can provide.",
  "It charges just fine on my 100 watt charger, even doing just fine while gaming (if the battery was full at the start of the session) it'll just downclock the system during low periods so that it can make up the difference. Can probably game for 6+ hours without having a significant power drop.\n\nI think the base CPU can draw as low as 20 watts on low power mode, and the entire system will draw something like 130 watts at max load, but rarely if ever is a game 100% all the time.",
  "Build quality is top notch IMO, similar tier as MacBook maybe just slightly lower, definitely in the top tier for windows laptops.",
  "I own a P16 as well, and yea the hinge is pretty wobbly. But I honestly don't notice it at all unless I'm using the touch screen, in which case yea sometimes I do need to keep my hand on the back of the lid for it to not wobble everywhere. Would have hypothetically loved a tighter hinge but in no way is it a dealbreaker haha.",
  "check if the new zephyrus G16 is available. its got 32GB of ram, but its the same system with a 240hz monitor. probably cheaper as well.\n\ntbh, the only times i have gotten even close to using all the ram is when I had fusion, 3ds max, adobe illustrator up at the same time processing a file with about 30m polies in it. and even then 70% of the memory was being taken by a memory leak (I suspect the asus apps are leaking memory every time the system goes into sleep, because each time it wakes up, its slightly slower until the next reboot).",
  "I noticed that too about a month ago. I bought one from Best Buy as an open box item, and it slowed down and blew screened. I returned it because it made me nervous. It started happening out of nowhere after using it for several hours while setting it up. It was such a great machine. I loved the speaker quality, too. It sounded as good as my TVs sound bar. Amazing! The fans were quiet and didn't heat up much at all under regular but not strenuous load. Have you had any more issues with blue screens? I am really hoping it was just a driver issue or just a bad apple since it was an open box item. Best laptop I've ever used otherwise. I just don't know if I want to spend that much without buying a warranty to go with it. Does anyone know where to buy it with a good warranty? I'm not really keen on Best Buy's warranties.",
  "I'm also worried about it. Tomorrow a proart p16 will be sent to me.I will share velevant experience to you.",
  "I managed to find one in a local store... yeah, it's grainy alright. Not as outright horrible as the comparable QHD+ Lenovo or HP touch-enabled OLEDs on display – if you sit far enough you might _just_ be able ignore the touchscreen layer. But you can very much tell that it's a layer and not just a panel imperfection. To me it would be usable enough, but I would not be super happy.\n\n\n\nComparing it side by side with my non-touch 4K OLED Blade – while white background on the Blade has some different kind of graining, it is by far less noticeable or jarring.\n\n\nI found the QHD+ Galaxy Books to have the clearest OLED, maybe even better than my Blade. But, well, they're not 4K, and otherwise not the kind of specs I was looking for.\n\n\nSadly I don't have a camera good enough to try and capture the difference visually.",
  "I don't even have a P16 (thinking about getting one though), but maybe it's a BIOS setting? Have you tried looking in there?",
  "No, it does just fine in all adobe products. I used illustrator and photoshop a little to make a watch face and as part of a 3d print project, but i mostly used it for fusion 360, 3ds max and blender, and if it can handle those, photoshop is relatively light.",
  "It doesnt handle 10bit 4:2:2 footage well at all, but less intensive codecs it does. And if you proxy, you don't have to worry.",
  "It goes up to the limit. I can edit 8k video, play all games etc, do GPU renders, but you cant do more than one at the same time. It's definitely the low limit for serious work, but it does work",
  "That’s fair. But should be said that the boring looks is why I love it. I take it to client meetings and show buildings on it. Definitely don’t game on it. I still think it looks nice but it’s clearly not trying to be a Zephyrus or anything. He’ll even the logo on the Razer blades ruins the professional appeal of those laptops for me.",
  "I would say it's fine, about normal for a laptop. It's not floppy, but it's also not rock steady.",
  "Strange, I've heard no coil whine what so ever from mine. I'm admittedly no longer in my 20's, but my hearing is pretty good.\n\nBesides the sound of the air moving at high fan speeds mine makes no other sounds, and even then it's very quiet if you aren't pushing it insanely hard (been playing a lot of factorization max settings, currently have a world that's been running for 70 hours, and the fans barely spin up running that long term.\n\nIt definitely hasn't spun up and down repeatedly, it's usually pretty passive, ramps up when it needs too and then goes back to silent once the load is off.\n\nHave you messed with the fan curve settings or maybe they were reset when you reset the computer? Mine are stock on \"performance mode\" and had no issues.\n\nMaybe get it checked out?",
  "Do all P16s come with an Ethernet dongle? Trying to see if I didn't leave it somewhere but I don't remember having one",
  "These have mono-color back lights on the keys, so they can only be white.",
  "Directly from asus's website.",
  "What's your software stack, if I can I can try and run while recording and see if it kicks on the fans.\n\nIf the load is low/medium the laptop is completely silent, if it starts hitting the GPU pretty hard, it'll get quite noticeable.\n\nedit: but i cant think of a laptop that isn't completely passive which would be more quiet under normal load. worse case, you can always temporarily force the fans to go into \"silent mode\" and as long as you don't do something crazy, it'll be fine for 5-10 minutes completely passive without kicking on it's \"drone sound generator\" mode.\n\nedit-edit: currently trying to generate a recording with a frequency analyzer sync'd to it so that you can judge for yourself, and it's picking up more sound from the dish washing marchine 2 rooms and walls away than it's getting from the laptop directly next to it, so I think that accurately conveys the amount of sound this makes.",
  "Hey,\nOverall: very happy with it.\n\nIt does cad / photoshop / illustrator / 3ds max / blender without any complaints, even with relatively heavy projects.\n\nSome times it's gotten a little squirally, but 99.9999% of the time it's been a Windows issue.\n\nStill a thin and light system with serious performance and I would say it trades pretty well with a similarly priced Mac book pro, but it can run windows and Linux at the cost of battery life.\n\nAll in all, I give it a solid 8/10 and would highly recommend it or the gaming varients for anyone looking for a laptop.",
  "Yes, I do see this, how strange. I'm guessing this is a bug between my asus and windows as I've never seen this issue as I never changed the MYASUS setting before.\n\nIt looks like the image desaturates.",
  "Thats great to hear!",
  "Just witnessed this with my own P16! Where is this referenced exactly? Projecting on anything HDMI will drain the battery rather quickly (4hrs) - I'll use a DP to HDMI adapter now on the left usb c DP port to use the iGPU - not ideal, not critical either (at least I have options).",
  "can the right usb c port do dp-alt mode?",
  "Sounds awesome! Thank you for reply!",
  "Is it wobble when you type?",
  "Sorry to bug you, but did you end up getting the laptop? What was you experience with it, if so?",
  "It's because it's a touch screen there is a capacitive layer. That's how touchscreens work.",
  "Funny story since I posted my comment.  I returned the laptop feeling that it was a bad system.  I grabbed a MacBook Pro M3 Pro system.  I used it for a week and decided that the 18GB Ram it had was not enough.  Did some research and somehow found something I must have missed a few times.  \"Stay focused with AI-powered ASUS Adaptive Dimming. It adjusts screen brightness based on your presence.\"  It will dim when it thinks you aren't looking at the screen or around it.  I decided to get the laptop again.  Went to the Best Buy that I returned my laptop to and I was able to my system as an open box.......the one I returned previously.  I originally bought it with a $200 off sale and this time the open box was another $200 off.  I got the laptop for just over $1,400 this time.  I found the setting and disabled it and it's been an amazing laptop.\n\nTL:DR\n\nFound the problem with the dimming and also saved $400 of the OG price.",
  "i pulled the trigger and bought the 64GB RAM version. we'll see how it fairs with Unreal Engine, but mostly  it will be my on the go video editor.  I built a very portable mini-ITX rig with an i9-13900k, 96GB RAM, and and RTX4080-(16GB VRAM) that travels in a pelican case (with an 18.4\" travel panel).  It will be a good comparison.  Stay tuned.",
  "Nope, all I did was set the power mode from the ProArt Hub, or MyASUS... but the fans do make a bit of noise when they start spinning or when they stop... and since you have no coil whine nor fan sounds, I'll probably bring it to a near ASUS centre to have it check... thought, it pisses me off quite a bit since how expensive this thing is... but thanks a lot for the answer!",
  "Appreciate it! I purchased it already, thanks to your post and reply!",
  "Thanks! Okay, looks like it’s the same on all units.\n\nI think it might be related to how this display panel behaves when using Flicker-Free Dimming.",
  "I never found a reference, just through trial and error as I had a device that is usbc, but requires an Nvidia dgpu.",
  "Yes",
  "I was worried about it when watching video reviews but in practice I never notice it. In fact I really forgot it was a “problem” until this comment haha 😂 so don’t worry about it in that regard",
  "That's true, but some manufacturers do manage to have much less noticeable capacitive touchscreen layers. It's probably more complicated or expensive to do though, maybe Samsung can only do it because they produce those screens themselves, who knows.",
  "Sweet! I'm really doubting between the ProArt and an MSI Stealth 16 AI Studio. I really like the design of the ProArt and the fact that it has the more efficient AMD chip than the MSI's Intel Core Ultra 9. I can overlook the ProArt having an RTX 4070 instead of the MSI's 4080, but the big dislike for me is the ProArt having a 'glare' screen, and the risk of OLED burn-in. (don't care about the 60Hz).\nIn your opinion, how 'bad' is the ProArt's screen glare, and do you have to take precautions against OLED burn in?",
  "As an aspiring Unreal dev myself, do you happen to have an update on how it performs? Looking into this laptop for similar usage as well.",
  "Ich habe die gleichen Erfahrungen gemacht, aber nur, wenn man ganz genau hinhört. Bei mir ist ein ganz leises Fiepen auf der linken Seite, nur hörbar, wenn man das Ohr nah ran bringt. Links hört es sich auch so an, als ob der Lüfter Intervall mäßig läuft. Hast du das Gerät überprüft?",
  "Thank you, then I guess it's not too bad. I'm considering the 32GB/rtx 4060/1TB variant. BestBuy has a decent deal at $1599",
  "I haven’t found it to be a problem in the P16 personally. I had the previous ProArt and it was much much more noticeable. I was actually surprised to see your comment because it was one of the first things I looked for when I got it and was like “heck yes” when I didn’t notice it. Maybe my older eyes are finally having some benefits as my attention to detail is going away lol",
  "Where my laptop sits does get a lot of sun light reflecting off the screen.  The glare is bad, but I've also owned a few MacBooks and the glare was bad with those too.  I'm a bit used to it.  If glare really bothers you, it might not be the laptop to get.",
  "Coming off an USB 3.2 enclosure, I am able to load up the City Sample small level (probably a decently heavy task).  Load times seem longer than my ITX case but I can navigate around the city just fine.

For $1586 , at best buy for this deal of $500.\n\nIm little worried about seeing the reviews of battery, bios, display, refresh rate, build quality and soo many.\n\nStill thinking how the laptop will be, I need it for a long run.",
  "Ya the glare is a feature for some and a bug for others. For me, I welcome it. There are so few laptops out there with a glossy screen anymore. It’s probably THE thing that persuades me from other Asus laptops that have a touch more power. But if you can’t do it, there’s way more options that don’t have it.",
  "I've bought a USB 4 enclosure for my external SSD and am considering buying a fast SSD for my D: ... this should increase load speeds by 400%",
  "I didn't buy it yet. I'll wait for CES 2025 to see if there are new cool devices. Also RTX 5000 laptops might be out soon.",
  "What I like about Strix Point is its efficiency, its performance at Quiet Mode is pretty awesome, way better than my 8845HS in balanced mode. But I'd like to see more options from Lenovo before making decision. You can try all you want in the return window.",
