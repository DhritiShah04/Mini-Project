  "Does anyone know anything about Lenovo Yoga 7 Gen 9 2-in-1 I was thinking about buying this laptop (all the specs and link below) for Uni. It suits all my needs with perfect display, ram, storage and even the processor is the latest Ryzen 7 8840HS. The only problem is I can't find a lot of reviews online so I am a bit hesitant. This is also my first time buying a laptop. Can anyone help or does anyone own this laptop?\n\n\n\nLenovo Yoga 7 2-in-1 14\" Gen 9\n16/512 GB\nAMD Ryzen 7 8840HS \n83DKCTO1WWSE1\nhttps://www.lenovo.com/se/sv/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-2-in-1-series/lenovo-yoga-7-2-in-1-gen-9-(14-inch-amd)/83dkcto1wwse1?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F&cid=se:sem:ct8unv&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw9cCyBhBzEiwAJTUWNXUrJ5x-w227jxQp2vYnQ71IqP8y5_VG3k3MMfo0Butw24YpmNvpyhoCZbQQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds#features",
  "I don't have this laptop but I bought and setup my cousin the previous gen yoga 7i and it looks like a good laptop but I would be a bit hesitant about the amd version solely because for some reason lenovo keeps pairing their amd 2 in 1s with sub par screens and with the current gen 7i also receiving a screen downgrade so I would honestly say get the last gen 7i (the one with the 13th gen intel and oled screen)",
  "How has it been? Im looking at this exact model",
  "I actually just bought this computer for Uni😭really hope its good ill comeback once i receive it this Friday",
  "Ok Thanks. But I think the screen on this one is upgradable to OLED. Also if it's a sub par screen in what ways are they bad as in like would they break easily or?? And I'll check out the last Gen 7i",
  "Just bought this model (Lenovo Yoga 7 2-in-1) when I went in dead set on getting a MacBook. I felt like this was more bang for my buck, they also include Xbox gaming on here, which I am a gamergirl so that's a plus.  Although, upon initial start-up it's seeming like this laptop is kinda slow/buffering? IDK maybe wrong choice of words but definitely have experienced some lagging to where I was like WTF? this is a brand new damn laptop.  I also live outside of the local city, my WIFI is bootycon meaning ABSOLUTE TRASHHHHHH so I am just hoping it's because of that.  I bought this laptop instead of the Macbook for 2 main reasons, the 1TB for roughly $700 & I was spoiled to the touch screen concept. (my other/previous laptop is a lenovo 2-in-1 ideapad? thinkpad? IDK but its a small laptop with google chrome), I needed the upgrade bc my exams are required to be proctored online and google chrome blocks the Guardian browser, which is what they use to proctor), Overall I'm hoping I don't regret this buy.  Any one know how long I have to be able to return for a full refund at bestbuy? \n\n\n\nAlso, if you come across any great pros about this laptop I'm here for it, this thing is apparently capable of alot so I want to reap all of it's benefits.",
  "Lmaoo I found a guy who bought it and was really positive about it...I'll also be buying it once I am back from vacation but lemme know when you get it",
  "Hey man, How is the experience with this PC? any heating / battery issues?",
  "updates?",
  "hey can I get a quick review on it ? performance overall, heating and BATTERY LIFE. How is it?",
  "Screen quality, I ordered one, still havent picked it up, but have heard about it not being very color accurate or bright",
  "hello!! Thinking of buying it, what do u think of it now? I personally also need it for school :) Thanks in advance!",
  "Hmm hopefully its just your wifi, ive read it comes with a lot of bloatware sp maybe that? It does seem the best bang for buck especially for a 2 in 1.",
  "Ciao, anch’io volevo comprare questo modello quindi volevo sapere se ti ha dato problemi fino ad ora. Per il gaming com’è? Poi riguardo al riscaldamento e consumo batteria durante il gaming?",
  "Phew okay what a relief that its a good laptop, it was recommended to me by a best buy employee and yk how they be so i HOPED they where being honest, since I was initially going to get the Microsoft Surface 5. yea ill let yk fs🔥💪🏻",
  "Heyy im back i didnt get the ryzen one but i got the intel one, its a solid computer it can handle games, school work, its not heavy or light its okayy, pretty good for school. I didnt find myself using the folding too much other than for movies. Got any questions? I can prob answer them!!",
  "Yea that's what I also saw somewhere...which screen did you get oled or ips?",
  "[removed]",
  "Hellooo did you buy it?",
  "Yea lol it has amazing specs imo I just wanted some reviews and from that one person it seems to be doing well",
  "hows the battery backup? and heating  \n and do the fans get loud?",
  "how long have you had it for? is there any issues?",
  "Ips, got a really good deal for the specs but idk, might cancel and get a Dell XPS (2022) or M1 Mac air (8gb version)",
  "I personally don't mind the color accuracy, I personally don't edit photos or videos, it's just my work laptop, hell I don't even watch YouTube on it. \n\nSo what are my notes:\nGlass: fingerprint magnet, reflective, makes colors more vibrant\nScreen: too dim for outdoor use, perfect for class/work conditions but not great outside",
  "Looking at this same machine. How did it turn out?",
  "The battery is pretty good depends on what you have it doing obviously but if you are doing homework most of the time you‘ll be good. The fans dont get loud. There is different performance settings when I play games i usually set it high and its not really loud but you could hear it. Its good tbh. Keyboard is fine, screen is good, good computer for a uni student although i recommend you get a mouse just cuz, the pad isn’t bad i just Dont really like pads a lot.",
  "Ive had it for about 7 months",
  "I was thinking about macbook but it's not my thing so imma check out the dell xps as well",
  "[removed]",
  "Love it bro got it like a couple days ago and I am very satisfied",
  "[removed]",
  "Yea it's not mine either but price to performance wise it's a smart buy",
  "Yea fs",
  "[deleted]",
  "Thanks for the response!",
  "Yea it works well i suggest you to buy a type of stylus pen obviously, but yea its works good. Theres prob settings to make it better that I dont know of. But i dont really use it a lot.",
  "[removed]",
  "Hello! Can I ask if you bought it? Im also debating whether I should buy it rn. But a lot of people have been complaining about the battery aswell which I assume you've already seen considering that you're asking about it too lol and how it breaks in just a year or two :') , and how about games too?",
  "They seem fine. Idk about 5-10 years of use but they seem sturdy for now",

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "need laptop that'll last me for all of college + more possibly! hi everyone! my dad is offering to buy me a new laptop (budget \\~$860 before taxes), and although i'd like to consider myself a computer nerd, everywhere I go I see mixed reviews on every laptop possible. I'm looking for a laptop with a solid battery life that'll last me for about 9+ hours on battery (although I'll be keeping it plugged in at the dorm), 16gb+ ram, 512gb+ storage, and good cpu/graphics for multitasking and light gaming (Roblox, light steam games, video editing, photoshop, Minecraft etc..). I'm leaning more towards a 2-in-1 as well to have it as a tablet too, but I'm not sure if that's the biggest priority. Any advice/suggestions? I'll link some here that I'm looking at.

  "High performance, long lasting laptop requirement. Budget €2500 Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for a Windows laptop which will do me a number of years. As longevity is important, I believe performance is an important criteria. My current setup is an 8th gen Intel i5 Asus laptop (8/256) and a M4 Mac Mini (24/512) on the desk. I want to replace both of these items with a single Windows laptop and I'll sell the Mac. I find Windows is more natural to me so I'm going that route.\n\nThe laptop will be 80% on the desk, open and the screen being used in addition to my on desk monitors. Although it'll be on the desk, I don't want something that weighs a ton and is practically not portable. Also quieter fans always helps.\n\nMy work is quite varied from Affinity photo, VS Coding/Cursor, Docker, VM's, MS Office, 20-30 browser tabs open etc. Apart from the additional RAM needed for VM's/Docker etc, I probably don't need a very high performing processor but since my last laptop gave me 6 years and the one before that was a 2012 MacBook Air, I expect longevity. While I love the form factor of 16\", I can't stand the numpad on these laptops but I guess it's something I'll have to live with. Budget in or around €2500 but I'd very happily not spend that much.\n\nCurrent machines I'm looking at:\n\n\\- Lenovo Legion 5i (2024) - i9-14900HX, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more). 1TB SSD, 16\" 240Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2000  \n\\- Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 16\" 120Hz 2.8k screen. €1400  \n\\- Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i Aura Edition (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 512 SSD, 14\" 120Hz 3k screen. €1700  \n\\- Asus ProArt P16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 4K 60Hz screen, RTX 4070. €2700  \n\\- Asus Zenbook S16 (2024) - AI 370 HX, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 16\" 3K 120Hz screen. €1700  \n\\- Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (2024) - Ultra 9 185 vPro, 16GB RAM (SODIMM so I can add more), No OS, 1TB SSD,  3K 120Hz screen. €2200.  \n\\- Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) - Ultra 9 285H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, 2 x 14\" 120Hz 3k screens. €2500\n\nI'm finding it very difficult to see past the value proposition of the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (2025) right now considering it's half the price of the ProArt P16 for practically the same (my) real world performance/usage. Any reviews for the IdeaPad I can find are quite positive. Second is the Yoga and I'm half thinking to just buy it and be done. I also realise that it's very early for many laptops to be available with the 200 series Ultra chips but I'm probably not interested in waiting for this or waiting for that. I'll probably buy in the next 2 weeks. I know the Yoga 9i is available in June but I suspect that would be outside my price range.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** €2500 (euro)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** I'd say 80% desk based. Looking for something to last 5 years\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Not overly important\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14-16\" with preference for 16\"\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Mostly web development so not heavy\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** No requirement for a touch screen. Would like a very good screen to look at.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Longevity is important. Do not want a Mac (already have a Mac Mini that I'm moving away from). I don't need a dedicated GPU. With the 200 series of Intel chips out, I'm not overly interested in 100 series. Not overly excited by 14th gen Intel either due to issues. That said, I have included some options.",
  "Have you ruled out Asus Zephyrus G16 (2024 or 2025)? It is a cheaper Asus ProArt with the same of internals.  These Asus model carry the best speakers of all Windows laptops which is nice to have if you have kids or others to share a screen.",
  "Update: Added the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 to the list",
  "Thinkpads amazing for build quality and longevity. The Ideapad 5 you're considering has significant issues with the hinge and will not last years if you use it like a laptop at all. I bought two Ideapad 5's and both failed at exactly 6 months, right after warranty expired. This is a widespread issue with the Ideapads though it's impossible to know with the brand new 2025's. \n\nFor your price range I'd probably say get the Thinkpad P1 gen 7 with OLED 4k. The Intel Ultra processors it comes with are generally efficient and quiet, and if you pick a lower TDP option GPU and something like the Ultra 7 155H it'll be very quiet when plugged in. Also, it has no numpad and a centered keyboard. As for price, there's brand new ones on Ebay with specs above that for about $1800-1900, from Lenovo with no sale it's over $3.5k lol",
  "Question: why are you listing high refresh rate laptops? Is that something you want?\n\nBecause I doubt you’ll max out that refresh rate in games unless you play older games or competitive online games.\n\nEdit: nvm just saw you don’t care about games.",
  "Have you considered a HP ZBook?",
  "T14 Thinkpads",
  "Update: Added the Asus Zenbook Duo (2025) to the list",
  "I did but seems a little difficult to find them not overly priced in Ireland.",
  "I'm doing some research on the P14s this morning.\n\nDirect from Lenovo I can get the Ultra 9 185H, no operating system, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 3K IPS display for €2370.\n\nA local retailer has the Ultra 9 185H, Win 11 Pro, 32GB RAM, 1TB performance SSD, 2560x1600 @ 90Hz display for €1790.\n\nI don't think the better display is worth €600.",
  "Also, unlike the ProArt you don't need to pay for a 4070 you said you wouldn't be using much. The 16:10 screen is also good for web development with it's bit of extra height. P1's are also pretty much the top of the Thinkpad scale, being workstation laptops and thus very solid. P1 gen 7 is also 17mm thick and 2kg so pretty portable.",
  "You're right, I never game but do appreciate a nice smooth screen. High refresh rate is not a must have but more a nice to have.",
  "I will take a look, thanks",
  "Thanks. A lot of praise online for Thinkpads",

  "Pure garbage. Don't buy this thing, many reported hinge problems including mine. Few months after the 2-year warranty expired, my left plastic hinge cover cracked and crushes the display glass.

Unfortunately they couldn't do anything.\n\nThe screen is also dim and muted in colors. The addition of touchscreen is nice, but not as nice when it broke.

  "I have the second one, the Slim 5i and I would not recommend it for $700 in 2025 for three reasons.\n\nIt is slim but takes up a lot of surface area with the taller 16:10 screen ratio.

Has a 45% NTSC rating where everything including YouTube feels washed out with a layer of white colors. Basically the same screen they were using in 2021, and likely just threw it on here because they have a lot of old stock.\n\nThe internals feels underpowered and lacks quality. Trackpad makes a flimsy clicky noise, keyboard isn't as polished with key travel, speakers sound tinny with no bass, webcam feels like a phone camera from 2015, it doesn't have 40 GBps thunderbolt 4 instead just basic 5GBps USB c ports. The Core 7 is a rebranded 2023 processor, not to be confused with the new Core ULTRA 7 processor from 2024.\n\nIf you haven't already you can go to a Costco and see these on display and play around with them. I doubt this lasts anywhere near 10 years like your old laptop, maybe just 3.",

  "new laptop experience: lenovo 9i 2-in-1 & omnibook ultra flip My old Yoga c920 (bought in 2018) ended its own life a couple of months ago, so needed a replacement 2-in-1. Discovered I wanted a Lunar Lake cpu, as on the HW side my main wants are single threaded processing and battery life, so LL suits me perfectly. Also, I care about build quality, I want at least several years of usage.\n\nFound that by far the best reviews are [https://www.notebookcheck.net/](https://www.notebookcheck.net/), but its a bit awkward to get the ones you want listed neatly.  Go there, select \"reviews\", search once & it will show advanced search options, set device class to \"convertible\" and type of review to \"notebookcheck reviews only\".\n\nSeems clear that right now the Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 and HP Omnibook Ultra Flip are the best candidates (also: ASUS Vivobook Flip looks good; and Thinkpads are nice but battery is not so good).\n\nImo Lenovo has an really unacceptable amount of \"bad hinges\" reviews around, mostly on their mid/low end machines: the cause is that they've been using glue where they should be using screws to attach the hinges to the display chassis (many other manufacturers also do/did this - however my old c920 with the \"watchband\" style hinge did it the proper way). For this reason I avoided the Yoga 7 series entirely, maybe they've fixed its problems by now but idk. With the Omnibook Ultra Flip you can check its maintenance manual online and find a diagram showing that all of its hinges are screwed into the metal chassis as they should be (looks not that hard to disassemble either). However Lenovo treats the whole display+hinge assembly as a single \"FPU unit\" which means you can't see inside it in the manuals to find out what's going on, or easily disassemble.\n\nSo I bought the Omnibook and it arrived 24 hours later. Build quality on it felt really great, looked like a really nice machine. Sadly the keyboard was not a proper UK keyboard (tbf to HP they do warn about this  - [https://support.hp.com/sg-en/document/ish\\_7481525-7481612-16](https://support.hp.com/sg-en/document/ish_7481525-7481612-16) \\- but I hadn't noticed it). It is just a US layout with some keys relabelled afaics. Result is that, for the UK, backslash is in totally the wrong place and is obtained as fn+L, also enter and backspace are the wrong shapes & in slightly wrong place. So back it goes, I use all those keys a lot and I'm not spending this amount of money to have to fiddle with a different keyboard layout to all my other machines. HP support was easy to deal with, they accepted the return without any problems or extra cost.\n\nSooo I bought the Yoga 9 2-in-1 as second choice. Only the \"aura edition\" is available currently in the UK, so I have that. On that:\n\n\\- It doesn't feel quite as solidly built as the Omnibook ultra did, but it still feels very good. I'm happy here, but can't tell if hinges are screwed in screen chassis vs some less good construction, so I'll just have to treat it gently.\n\n\\- Screen is awesome. I have the 2.8K screen, which all reviews recommended over the 4K. (Had some fun with my custom rainmeter skins and UI scaling but sorted it out.)\n\n\\- Battery life is very good, I get well over a whole days usage doing light work on it.\n\n\\- Keys and touchpad feel good, I don't think I am very fussy here. See bit below about the \"extra\" keys on the lenovo 9 series.\n\n\\- Ofc I've gone for a 2-in-1 because I sometimes need to write on the screen. It came with a pen that works well. The screen is smooth glass - I guess it is not as nice as e.g. a Remarkable tablet to write on, but it still works well. I made a presentation with 25 handwritten slides as the first usage of the new machine, no complaints.\n\n\\- No fan noise unless it is under load. I'm happy using it.\n\n\\- It took about 3 weeks to arrive.\n\n\\- I got the \"base\" lunar lake 9i 2-in-1 model with the 256V and 16GB RAM. If you need more RAM (I don't) then maybe worth getting one of the other models, otherwise not worth it afaics.\n\n\\- There is some bloatware but its easily dealt with. I have no idea what all the \"aura\" stuff even does, probably uninstalled it without using it, idk. Also my first time doing anything non-superficial with win11...  seems like many of win11s original UI regressions on win10 have been sorted out, but the Win11 taskbar/startmenu is still a horrible disaster (it still looks like it was built for a phone ffs) so I did get Stardock Start11, and that works nicely.\n\n\\- All the \"AI\" stuff isn't much use to me. It's cute that windows Click To Do can recognize text from within images but I can't find anything else useful than it can do (also, that really did not need a special chip with 40 TOPS...). I tried asking questions to copilot a few times and it was waste of time - for simple stuff it was no better than better using a search engine yourself and for complicated stuff it just talks crap.\n\n\\- There is a row of four \"extra\" keys on the right of the keyboard. They get in the way a bit at first but I've got used to them in about a day - had to learn that \"smack little finger down near edge of laptop\" is no longer a good strategy when I want to press enter. Overall I like the features these keys access but I'd rather the keys weren't there, not the best use of space imo, but its ok. (Page up/down + home + end keys would be more useful imo.)\n\nI didn't find much info about the keys online so here goes: one changes the \"power mode\" (3 modes: battery, balanced, perf) and is fairly useful because the cpu has both P and E cores, so (amongst other things) it gives some control over which set of cores you want to be using. Discovered this by running hwinfo whilst changing the power mode.\n\nThe next one changes the \"audio mode\" and is totally pointless, the machine has great sound whatever mode its in. The third changes \"eyecare mode\" and is a slightly useful to me - I have f.lux on constantly filtering blue light, and this key then acts as a toggle to add some extra strength to the filter on top of what f.lux does. The fourth key is configurable, I set it to open my most-used application.",
  "hello there, thanks for this comparison. I'm currently deciding between these two. May I know if you have the 2025 gen 10 for the Yoga? Do you see any screen door effect on the Yoga? I currently have the Omnibook Ultra Flip 14, got it at a really nice price but the screendoor effect on the OLED display is killing the deal for me. I'm wondering if the Yoga also has the same issue?\n\nI was trying out a Yoga 7 Slim (with touchscreen), it doesnt have such issue.\n\nThanks a lot!",
  "Yes, the gen 10 (gen 9 does not have lunar lake). I did not see a screen door effect on either the omnibook or the 9i with 2.8K. Imo the 9i 2.8K has the better screen, but I would have happily had either screen.",

Both would be purchased at similar prices (2nd hand), I just used the bestbuy links as they offered the most information and match the models exactly. \n\n  \nI have gone though many laptops before and impartial to either in this case.

  "Need Help Choosing the Perfect Laptop for Civil Engineering: Overwhelmed by Options! **Hi everyone,**\n\nI'm currently in the market for a new laptop with a budget of $1500-$2000. As a civil engineering student, I need a Windows laptop with strong performance to handle CAD software and, most importantly, one that will stand the test of time. I've been searching for a week now, spending hours each day, but the options are overwhelming, and none of them seem to stand out as the clear best choice. That's why I could really use your help.\n\nI'm far from an expert in this area, so advice from people who know more than me would be incredibly valuable. Here's what I'm looking for in a laptop: a powerful processor (I'm open to both Intel and AMD, though I'm a bit wary of the new Qualcomm chips due to compatibility concerns), 32 GB of RAM, 1TB SSD storage, and I don't really care about the GPU since I don't game.\n\nFrom my research so far, it seems that Asus and Lenovo laptops tend to have better longevity, which is a big priority for me. Here are some of the options I've found that meet my basic criteria (satisfactory processor, 32 GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD):\n\n* **Lenovo Yoga 9i Pro Gen 9:** Looks really promising, but the battery life concerns me, especially at this price point, considering that I don't game.\n* **Asus Zenbook S16:** I've read some reviews claiming this is the best laptop of 2024, while others criticize its cooling issues, particularly the keyboard, and suggest that the processor’s performance isn’t as great as it looks on paper.\n* **Asus Zenbook 14/14X/14 Pro:** This is currently my top contender because it seems versatile and has received a lot of positive feedback. However, I'm still undecided on which model to go for, though the Zenbook 14X looks really appealing in certain configurations.\n* **Dell XPS 13/15:** I've seen many positive comments about Dell's XPS series, but there are also concerns regarding their durability and cooling system.\n\nI've also had Lenovo ThinkPads recommended to me, but there are so many models that I'm not sure which are the most worthwhile. The same goes for Dell Latitude and Precision series.\n\nAgain, I’m not an expert, but this is an important purchase for my studies, and I want to make the best choice possible. What do you think is the best laptop option for me? Thanks for reading, and I really appreciate any advice you can offer!\n\n",
  "Mini review of the Acer Spin 5 2020 edition I am a longtime Macbook Pro 13\" user and mainly use my laptop for programming and photography.  As Windows 10 now comes with a [subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) I was curious to see if a Win10 laptop could work as my main laptop. I have been locking at several alternatives (Lenovo Yoga Slim looked like the best option) but settled on an Acer Spin 5. I could not find any reviews of the [Acer Spin 5 2020 edition ](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/series/spin5) so here is a short writeup of my findings . \n\nI tried to make a list of what I  wanted from a new laptop. On the list was: \n\n* A high-DPI 16:10 or 3:2 screen (better for text than a 16:9) with decent brightness \n* A decent processor upgrade - 10th gen Intel Core i7. \n* 1TB SSD \n* Fingerprint reader \n* At least one USB-C port \n* Backlit keys \n\nAt first I ordered the Acer Swift 3 2020 edition. It had the right specs and had great performance but after a couple of weeks I had to return it for the following reasons: \n\n1. A loud beep every time you plug in the charging cable (after digging around it seems impossible to disable it). Not great if you want to charge while someone is sleeping next to you. \n2. Tiny speakers that sound broken (probably because they are tiny and face downwards). \n3. Silver keyboard impossible to read when it is backlit. \n\nAfter returning the Swift I got the Acer Spin 5 instead. It has  a built-in pen and is a 2-in-1 laptop although that was not part of my requirements. It lacks a dedicated graphics card but has the new generation of Intel's Iris Plus graphics which seems to perform reasonably well. \n\nHere are my findings: \n\n# What I liked \n\n1. The build quality feels decent. Apparently it is made from magnesium-aluminium alloy that sometimes feels a bit plasticky but has  a nice matte grey surface. \n2. The keyboard is great. It is closer to the 2013 MBP. The keys are dark and back lit and after remapping caps lock to escape it only took about a day of typing to make it feel like the new normal.  \n3. The laptop has a great array of ports, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 3 support. \n4. The screen is OK with a DPI that made the transition from retina Mac easy. The extra vertical screen space is great for working with text. The screen is not evenly lit though, but this is hard to notice unless you display a black picture. \n5. The pen was surprisingly good. This is not something I will be using much but doing some simple sketches feels intuitive and responsive. The pen is stored inside the laptop body so it will not likely get lost. \n\n# What I didn't like \n\n1. I spent a couple of hours getting rid of stickers (that weren't even placed straight) and uninstalling Acer software and bundled crap. This is a bad user experience and I wish that laptop manufacturers would just stop placing stickers and pushing bad software. No-one needs a \"HDMI\" sticker on the screen. \n2. There are two hinges that facilitate the flip-over of the screen. The problem is that after flipping it over they get out of sync so you have to fold it completely back up before opening it in laptop mode again. There is definitely a risk of the screen getting bent from this if you do not fold it carefully. \n3. The touch pad is not comparable with the MBP (this one actually moves when you click it but it is OK). The placement of the finger print reader on the touch surface is just weird. It is distracting every time you swipe over it (it creates a hole in the swipeable area of the  touch pad surface but is small enough that your movement is still picked up).  The finger print reader detects my finger on the first try about 75% of the time.\n4. There are vents underneath the laptop (that will get covered up if you use your laptop in bed). On the plus side there is also a vent below the screen that is difficult to cover. It looks like air is supposed to flow from underneath the laptop to the vent under the screen. The laptop runs its fans more often than my MBP does. Hard to know why but seems like having Docker up and running could be a factor. \n5. The charger looks like a cheap power brick, especially with the thin charging pin. This pin feels like it will be the first part to break. The charging port is on the left side of the laptop. The two USB-C ports also work for charging but those are also on the left side so it is not possible to charge it from both sides. I would have preferred one USB-C port on the right side. \n6. Sound is definitely better than the Acer Swift but it is  still not very good. \n\nIf there  is anything you want to know more about, ask away.",
  "How is the battery life during basic office work and internet browsing?",
  "Hey, I'd like to check something with you if it's ok (I have the same laptop)   \nyou speak about \"A loud beep every time you plug in the charging cable\", do you have it with the Spin 5 or not? Because I do. Also, the backlight of the keyboard stopped working for me. Do you by any chance upgraded the bios and still having the backlight working? I try to understand if I have a hardware issue or if the new bios are messed up. I'm also seeing changing battery remaining time reports.",
  "Hello\nThank you very much for your review. I am in the process of also buying a Laptop with a high resolution 3:2 screen (unfortunately there aren't a lot of devices available...). And the Acer Spin 5 is one in which I am very interested. However according to some reviews it uses PWM to regulate the screen brightness with a very low refresh rate (200hz). PWM strains the eyes and make them sore after prolonged use according to the Internet. Do you remark this? Do you have the feelings that your eyes are more strained as with the MBP? I ask as except for the PWM the acer is currently my favorite. Thank you very much for an answer.",
  "I'm interested in whether you are keeping the Acer or going back to Mac. As a longtime Mac user, I sometimes feel like that the PC laptop market is producing more interesting machines.",
  "Great mini review, Thank you! \n\nHow is it holding up? I'm thinking of grabbing one, just waiting to see if there is any pricereductions for black friday. \n\nIf you would care to update how you like it now.   \nAny problems or frustrations? \n\nstill not noticing the PWM ? \n\nFound a workaround of the charger beep?\n\nThank you for your time",
  "It is OK but nowhere near the advertised 15 hours. I would say I get about the save battery life as with the now three year old MBP 2017 I was using.",
  "Well I updated BIOS to v1.05 and there is now a beep when plugging in the charging cable. Extremely irritating. Is there anyone from Acer here?",
  "I have no beep in the Spin 5 (or I would have returned it).  Have not upgraded bios. Do you have the 2020 edition of the Spin 5?",
  "I have not thought about it and had too look it up. I saw [this review](https://laptopmedia.com/review/acer-spin-5-sp513-54n-review-finally-a-worthy-2-in-1-from-acer/) that said something similar. Normally my screen brightness is set to very high so maybe I won't notice it? I have had several multi-hour sessions without thinking about it.",
  "I am keeping the Acer Spin 5. After a couple of weeks now I find it works great for my needs. Win10 with WSL now has the gateway to Linux stuff I need and I can run Lightroom and other software in Windows. A coupe of web apps for iCloud notes and reminders keeps me in the Apple ecosystem (but I lack the phone integration).",
  "Oh and do you still have the keyboard backlight working ?\n(I don't know if Acer would answer there, but given they don't on community forum I won't hold my breath)",
  "Yes, the latest one (SP513-54N). Thanks for your reply it helps a lot.",
  "Yeah this was exactly the review I have also read (unfortunately this is also currently the only one in which they test the screen throughly). As PWM is especially remarkable at low brightness this can give us two possible answers. Either you are not very sensibel to PWM (good for you, you are blessed with good eyes ;), not like me) or Acer fixed it with an update (normally this is entirely an hardware thing, however I have found on YouTube a Polish guy who showed that it is possible for certain acer devices to fix PWM with a low level hardware update (see here https://youtu.be/vdw6n0YhvBQ). I think I will have go to my nearest computer store and look at the device for one hour straight to see if the PWM is a problem for me  or not ;) Still thank you very much for your answer.",
  "Backlight is still working though so maybe that is a hardware issue for you.",
  "I upgraded the BIOS to 1.05 and I now have a beep (with the main charger but not if I use a USB-C charger). After the upgrade there is no keyboard backlight. Any idea how to fix it?",
  "My BIOS version is 1.00. Are you on a later version?",
  "Did you end up finding if the PWM was significant enough for you to not purchase?",
  "No sorry :( Did backlight stop working right after the BIOS upgrade? Because that could be a loose keyboard cable connection inside (I still have to open mine to take a look).",
  "Yes the latest one. I tried them all but the legacy one is not available to download for me to try to switch back. I have not noticed when the issue started.",
  "I've looked at the computer in my local computer store and to say it mildly, I was shocked about PWM. I filmed the laptop screen with my smartphone camera on various brightness levels and if I remember correctly, when staying under 60% brightness a very intense flackering, like seen on the video posted before, was seen on screen. As I have very light sensitive eyes (i usually work with most laptops on 10% brightness or sometimes even less), I concluded that this flackering, seen on camera, will over long work periods also add some eye strains (this is my personal opinion, maybe you are less sensitive, or maybe I imagine things, who knows). \nFinally I bought the Matebook X Pro 2020, i5, (does not use PWM) as in my country these two were similiar priced. Plus I get a better screen (3K instead of 2K, also 3:2), a better keyboard and better overall build quality. However I loose the 360° hinge and the wacoom pen input. I sacrificed these two options, as I have an old Chuwi Hi13 (cheap clone of the surface Book 1), which I can use when I need pen input.",
  ":-( I think it disappeared right after the BIOS upgrade. I am still under warranty so I won't open it myself. Not happy with Acer at the moment...",
  "Thx. Now I may be reluctant to update BIOS:-)",
  "Thanks for the update, I appreciate it!",
  "Laptop recommendation I will be going on a trip for a year, to work and travel. Currently, I work as a software engineer and I'd like to find some software related job during my travels. At home I have a desktop, which I won't be taking with me on the trip. \n\nI'm looking for a laptop to take with me, on which I can do work (coding), consume media and potentially do a bit of gaming.\n\nMy ideal laptop would look like this:  \nGood battery life (like 9 hours of text editing or general web browsing), performance to compile code quickly when needed, something that looks like a GPU for the occasional gaming (something like a Nvidia XX60 series, the mid range), a higher than 1080p (or 1200p for 16:10 displays) resolution screen that is preferably 16 inch for that extra real estate. I also don't want it to look gamery and have good build quality. Also, large trackpad and centered keyboard (no keypad) are a plus. 32 gigabyte of RAM is preferred since that is handy for coding.\n\nSince I code mostly C# for now, I need a Windows laptop. I have never used MacOS and don't really want to get into that, just because I couldn't find a windows laptop. If C# WPF applications ran on MacOS, I would buy a macbook for sure.   \nI'm used to the Windows ecosystem (if that's even a thing).\n\nNon the less, if it turns out that MacOS is actually very friendly to software development, I should maybe consider a Mac? To be clear, software development to me means coding C, C++, C#, Java, Python... Using the full fledged Visual Studio, or creating apps with Qt Creator. No web related things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy budget is between 2000 and 2500 euro's\n\nI've been browsing the web over the last few weeks and I just can't seem to find the one.  \n\n\nI compiled a list of strong contenders but all of these still seem to have downsides.\n\n* Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen5\n   * (+) Good looking laptop, good build quality\n   * (+) Has a  1600p display, 16 inch\n   * (+) Expandable RAM and storage\n   * (+) 3050Ti\n   * (\\~) High capacity battery (it is sadly Intel exclusive and has worse battery than AMD alternatives)\n   * (-) Around 3k, except for when it's on sale.\n* Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i\n   * (+) Very nice build\n   * (+) 3.2K display, 16 inch\n   * (\\~) Intel processor so good performance but bad battery life, I'd rather give in some of that performance and have way better battery.\n   * (-) The base model only has 16 gigs of non expandable RAM, going for the higher spec (64 GB) bumps the price up to 3.3k euros, which is too much. A 32 GB alternative would be the 7i, but that one doesn't offer a dedicated GPU (it did for a few days but then the option vanished on the website), and it's only a 14 inch display, which would be sub optimal.\n* Lenovo T16 / P16s (same laptop different name from what I could gather)\n   * (-) No option at all for dedicated GPU\n   * (+) Has AMD \n   * (+) Right display\n   * (\\~) trackpad / keyboard setup not what I prefer\n* Lenovo Z16\n   * (+) Looks good\n   * (+) Has AMD \n   * (+) Right display\n   * (+) Can game\n   * (+) Good battery life\n   * (-) Seems to have mixed reviews, for one, it does not have nearly as many reviews as other laptops by the big tech youtube channels. People report that there is a hardware issue with the motherboard or something which makes these laptops shut down and whatever\n* Dell XPS 15\n   * No need for description, everyone knows this. Excellent machine and runs too hot so not really usable then\n* Dell XPS 17 2023\n   * Does not run as hot with the vapour chamber cooling but is above 3k\n* Dell XPS 17 2022\n   * Good price, has everything I need, but since I'm from Belgium, I'm used to typing with an AZERTY layout, and this 2022 model only offers English QWERTYs (the letters are no issue, it's all the special symbols that are in other places that would be a pain to learn. But I could get used to it. It's a compromise non the less)\n* Asus Zephyrus M16 or G16 \n   * Has the stupid gamer lights on the back which I can't unspec. I can leave them off but still there are the perforations for the lights and I just don't need that crap.\n   * Also don't know if I trust the build quality and reliability as much as I would trust a Dell or Lenovo\n   * also uses the barrel connector charging with a huge brick which I really don't need. It's 2023, just use USB C already\n   * Minor issue but the font on the keyboard is stupid imho\n* Asus Flow X16 whatever thing\n   * Has the ribbels on the back which are also not needed at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of this just gets me wondering how hard it can be to just design a macbook-like brick that is a square box with a big battery, a lot of slats for ventilation, a bright 1600p screen, centered keyboard, big an haptic glass topped touchpad Windows laptop. I guess the Dell XPS or Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i come the closest but have other issues being either expensive af, and / or run hot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wonder if I'm missing something or if I will have to make some compromises since the perfect laptop doesn't exist.",
  "Lenovo Yoga 7i Gen10, 14-inch laptop (2025) review **UK-based Laptop Review**\n\n**1. Title:**  \nLenovo Yoga 7i Gen 10 (2025) Review: power and portability\n\n**2. Introduction:**\n\nThis is a review for the 2025 yoga 7i gen 10 model from Lenovo with intel core ultra 7 258v and 14 inch screen. I bought the configuration from the UK Lenovo website with 32GB RAM, 1TB SDD, 2.8k OLED 120Hz screen, Luna Grey colour and optioned the fingerprint scanner for an additional £10, paying £1090 in total (including the 10% VIP discount for healthcare workers). This is a premium grade 2-in-1 consumer laptop with a solid build, great for anyone who needs a portable and powerful device.\n\nI haven’t seen many user reviews for this particular generation of laptop so thought it would be useful for anyone considering it.\n\n**3. Design and Build Quality:**\n\nThe chassis all metal, which gives it a very solid feel. The build quality is great, there’s very little flex in the case or the keyboard. The body does not pick up fingerprints. At 1.4kg, it’s not the lightest laptop but it’s still very portable. It fits my 13 inch laptop sleeve. I don’t have much use for the tablet mode as I find it too cumbersome when compared with holding an actual tablet. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and the trackpad is smooth and accurate. I appreciate the double height enter key. Coming from the LG gram 16, this is a much better typing and trackpad experience.\n\nPort selection is good. There are 2 USB-C ports, one on either side, with one USB-A, one full-sized HDMI, a microSD card slot and a headphone jack. The power key is on the right side which I’ve mis-pressed a couple of times so I’ve disabled it in the settings.\n\nThe display is a 14-inch glossy OLED touchscreen with 2.8K resolution (2880 x 1800), 500 nits brightness (1100 nits HDR Peak). I find the screen bright and vibrant. Watching video in a dimmed room is fantastic with zero light bleed. Reflections and fingerprints can be an issue, especially when viewing dark things on the screen and there is bright ambient. However it is still useable under these conditions.\n\nThe hinges are solid, with little screen wobble when typing but it does require two hands to open the lid. The look and feel of the laptop is very nice with smooth rounded outer edges.\n\n**4. Performance and heat:**\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 258v is perfectly capable of handling my usual tasks of multiple Chrome/ Firefox tabs, connecting to my remote desktop for work and steaming video content.  I have tried some gaming and the experience with casual  games has been very good. Fortnite runs at 120FPS. Cities Skylines runs great. I’ve tried playing Watchdogs and although it could play it, the framerates were only around 40fps and the processor got quite hot with the fans getting noisy.\n\nThe keyboard and palm rest areas are always cool. The area under the screen gets warm under load but the hot air is blown out through the vents on the back, away from the user which is a good design.\n\n**5. Audio and Webcam:**\n\nThe speakers are fine, they are up firing from the sides of the keyboard and they are rated for Dolby Atmos. I can clearly hear the 3D effects when watching YouTube or Netflix. There isn't much bass but it is acceptable for a thin and light laptop.\n\nThe 5M IR camera is decent for video conferencing. There is a privacy shutter switch just above the camera. Windows Hello usually takes just a few seconds to log me in. I have found the fingerprint scanner works faster, especially when the lighting conditions are not ideal for Windows Hello.\n\n**6. Battery Life:**\n\nThe 70WHr battery lasts all day for me when web browsing/ streaming videos. I use a 100W Ugreen 4-port USB C charger to charge all my devices and the laptop fully charges within a couple of hours.  \n\n**7. Software and User Experience:**\n\nThe OS is Windows 11 Home 64 and comes with some minor bloatware including McAffee Antivirus, Lenovo support/ vantage/ AI shenanigans. The Lenovo Vantage software has some useful features including dimming various parts of the screen to save battery – I only use the taskbar dimming though as I find the background dimming too distracting. It also enables you to switch the laptop on just by lifting the lid, which means the much maligned side power switch is hardly ever used. There have been reports of this power button breaking easily on other models and thus bricking the device.\n\n**8. Price and Value:**\n\nThe base model costs £1000 (£900 for students or those that qualify for VIP member) and comes with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and a14inch WUXGA OLED screen (1920x1200, 400nits, 60Hz). I was happy to pay the \\~£200 premium for the better spec’d screen with double the RAM and SSD. Mine came with a 65W USB-C charger and a stylus pen which magnetically attaches to the lid.\n\n**9. Pros and Cons:**\n\n* **Pros:** Screen, performance, battery life, keyboard\n* **Cons:** Screen reflections, power key positioning.\n\n**10. Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a well-built laptop where the pros far out-weigh the cons. The OLED screen is fantastic and it has been a pleasure watching content in a darkened room. It is very easy to travel with, having all-day battery life and a thin and light form factor.\n\n**Final Rating:** 9/10",
  "Really nice post.\n\nIm looking into this as pretty much the only option as the price is really good compared to others.\n\nIm sceptical about the hinges, but you say they are fine. And also if the performance is okay, if i could spec it id go higher but there arent really any options. \n\nThe next thing is vivobook which goes about 50% more with worse screen",
  "How about the weight, does it feel heavy...do you think it's worth the penny and do you think it's a good investment until 2028 atleast?",
  "Im setting up my 16 inch model right now and the fans are running on low constantly and high pitch too, did yours do the same?",
  "Hey, I am curious how did you opt for the fingerprint scanner. I can't find it in the configurations. Thanks.",

  "hello, here some questions:\n1. what version of hdmi port does it have?\n2. What components could you upgrade? ssd, battery, keyboard?",

  "Yoga Slim 7i 14\" Gen 10 vs Yoga Slim 7i Gen 9 15\". Oled or Ips, that is the question! Hello everyone, I should buy a new laptop and I am very undecided between these 2 Lenovo models:\n\n* Yoga Slim 7i 14\" Gen 10, Oled screen\n* Yoga Slim 7i 15\" Gen 9, Ips screen\n\nboth with same cpu, ram, etc. (Ultra 7 258V cpu, 32 Gb) at the same price.\n\nHere are the pros and cons that result from my point of view and for the use that I would make of them:\n\n**Yoga Slim 7i 14\" Gen 10**  \n  \nPros: perfect size and superior quality screen (I think!).  \n  \nCons: The Oled screen scares me for the burn in (does it still exist in 2025?) and for the PWM even if I do not know if I am sensitive to this effect (is there a way to check it quickly?). No reviews of this model.\n\n**Yoga Slim 7i 15\" Gen 9**\n\nPros: Ips screen that does not have problems with either burn in or PWM and perhaps it reflects less light (but I'm not sure about this). A lot of enthusiastic review.  \n  \nCons: Slightly larger dimensions. I don't need a touch screen. Lower quality of blacks compared to OLED screen.\n\nDo you know if the 2 battery chargers are the same size for both models? My priority is to have a device that lasts a long time (the one I'm replacing lasted almost 10 years!).\n\nWhich one would you choose and why?",

  "Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9 (2024) vs. HP Spectre 14 (2024) - Quick Comparison / Personal Impressions Hi all,\n\ndecided to post a quick review / comparison because I see a lot of people are facing similar buying decision.\n\nI own an Intel 11th generation Yoga 7 Slim 14 inch laptop and am looking for something new. The Yoga 7 is really creaky, has really bad speakers and - main reason I want to switch - only has 60hz. My main monitor and smartphone have 120hz and for me its the biggest innovation in years. I only have a laptop paired with an eGPU (RTX 3060) for desk setup, which works pretty well. I also thought it would be nice to have a 2-in-1 laptop for travelling, long haul flights etc.\n\nTo cut a long story short, after some research I decided on the HP Spectre 14 and the Yoga 9i 2-in-1, both with the latest Intel CPU. I pre-ordered both, so I received each of them with almost no reviews (and therefore no BIAS) out there.\n\nBoth versions had new Intel CPU 155H, 120hz (glossy) OLED screen. The Spectre came with 32GB, the Yoga 2-in-1 with 16GB. I wont talk much about performance because it doesnt really matter for me. There are now benchmarks out to compare.\n\nthe sad news first: I returned both laptop\n\n||HP Spectre 14|Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Design|+/- Personally, I didnt really like the design. Its way better / professional predecessor, but I still dont like the bulkiness and the cut corners of the spectre. Looks somehow awkward for me.|No great design as well. Its somehow looks like an unproportional burger. The top of the laptop is smaller then the bottom, in combination with its rounded and glossy edges it looks very akward. I chose colour \"cosmic blue\" which is okay, but a fingerprint magnet|\n|Build Quality|+ Very nice build quality, solid materials - not creaky at all. Very good hinge.|+ Very good, cant complain. Not creaky at all.|\n|Speakers|+ Very good speakers. Quality reduces drastically if you use in tablet mode, since the speakers actually play in the opposite direction|+ I think the best speakers I ever heard on a laptop, since its basically a huge rotating soundbar. This is great in tablet and tent mode as well, because the sound is still going in your direction|\n|Trackpad|+ Very nice haptic trackpad, definitely the best trackpad I ever used (on track with Macbook Pro)|-/+ Trackpad is only ok. Its not haptic, which is a dissapointment in their flagship|\n|Keyboard|+/- Keyboard was ok, but I don't understand the hype about it. I might be biased because I use Lenovo notebooks at work and home for years.|+ Keyboard is nice. But as said, Im biased / used to use Lenovo keyboards. I didnt like the additional row right to the \"return\" button|\n|Display|- Overall, a very nice OLED screen. But no matter.  The screen was absolutely terrible in terms of the 'screen door effect', I couldnt stand the graininess. I had read before that this could be a problem, but I was sure I could get used to it, but in reality it was an absolute nightmare.                   - Another annoying issue with the screen is that it is barely dimmable. I often use the laptop in bed/dark surroundings to stream something before going to sleep. The lowest dim level is still super bright. You have to use extra software to dim it.|- Nice OLED as well. Drastically less Screen door effect to a level I could live with. Also, its dimmable to very low brightnesss out of the box. Unfortunately the screen is super glossy. I mean, so glossy that in dark enviroment even the backlight of the keyboard is reflected.|\n|Other|- The \"Power On\" button is illuminated constantly, which is very annoying|-|\n\nAs I said, I have returned both laptops. I paid around €1700 for each and each had major faults that did not justify the price for me. The main reasons were the displays, I think glossy is just not for me. While I could live with the Yoga's display, I really missed the haptic touchpad and hated that it only came with 16GB.\n\nThe search continues. I think im done with looking for 2-in-1 and will get a tablet instead. Basically all I need is \"good/very good speakers, haptic t rackpad, non glossy and minimum 90hz screen\".  I have now pre-ordered the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4, which has a matte display and a haptic touchpad, unfortunately it is only 13.5\".  I also assume that the speakers will be bad. Will keep you posted :)\n\nHope it helped!",
  "I'm deciding between these 2. The 2-1 format would be useful for document reading etc, but the glossy screen issue is a deal breaker.   \n  \nCan anyone attest to the effectiveness of a matt screen protector to counter act the reflection?",
  "THANK YOU. Finally, someone who actually addresses the screen door effect in both flagship models. I work in the professional visual industry and need crystal clear displays, or at least with less graininess like e.g. Surfaces. I got both the Yoga 7i and Spectre for comparison and it drove me insane. I'm returning both and ordered the 9i now after reading your review - I found a model with 32GB RAM.\n\nOut of curiosity (and to better justify my money spent...) - Would you surmise you would've kept the Yoga 9i if only it had 32 Gigs of RAM?",

  "Hey so I've also been tied between the Lenova Yoga 9i pro and HP Spectre 360 16 inch. Both in 32 GB. The main difference is HP uses a OLED screen but 2800X1800 Res while Lenova Uses LED 3200X2000 Res. The lenovoa looked brighter. The other difference is the HP is 2 in 1 where as the Lenova has the Ultra 9 core processor and HP has the Ultra 7 core processor. So one is newer processor and higher resolution. The other is 2 in 1 and OLED screen oh and the HP has much better speakers. My issue now is that there is another Lenova yoga 9i option which is only $200 more which comes with a Mini LED screen, a higher graphics card 4060X, and 1200 Nit brightNess which is exponentially higher then HP and most other Laptops. The ONLY problem I've seen with that higher Lenova 9i option is that the battery is listed at 5 hours but people have claimed it barely lasts 3 hours. Sigh* If it didn't have the battery issue, I'd get the fully loaded yoga 9i in a heart beat so now I'm still tied between the original 9i or HP Spectre both in 16 inch 32 GB with same graphic card.",

  "Dell Inspiron 14 7445 (2-in-1) (AMD) vs Lenovo Yoga 7 Gen 9 14 (2-in-1) (AMD) Hi, my Dell XPS 15 (2019) recently died and I am considering buying a new laptop (800-900 euros budget) as a temporary solution while waiting for the new RTX series 5x, after which I plan to build a high-end gaming pc.\n\nI need a laptop that can do some light gaming (eg Overwatch, League of Legends, ...), while being portable and looking professional. With my budget in mind, I reduced the choice down to:\n\n* [Dell Inspiron 14 7445 (2-in-1) (AMD)](https://www.dell.com/de-de/shop/dell-laptops/inspiron-14-2-in-1-laptop/spd/inspiron-14-7445-2-in-1-laptop/cn74802sc): discounted to 854 with student discount.\n* [Lenovo Yoga 7 Gen 9 14 (2-in-1) (AMD)](https://www.lenovo.com/de/de/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-2-in-1-series/lenovo-yoga-7-2-in-1-gen-9-(14-inch-amd)/83dkcto1wwde1) discounted to 917 with student discount.\n\nThe specs should be very similar (Ryzen 7 8840HS with 780M iGPU, 16GB RAM, comparison on Nanoreview: [https://nanoreview.net/en/laptop-compare/lenovo-yoga-7-gen-9-14-amd-vs-dell-inspiron-14-7445?m=c.2\\_d.1\\_r.2-and-b.1\\_c.2\\_r.2&ws=a.1\\_d.3\\_g.4\\_y.4](https://nanoreview.net/en/laptop-compare/lenovo-yoga-7-gen-9-14-amd-vs-dell-inspiron-14-7445?m=c.2_d.1_r.2-and-b.1_c.2_r.2&ws=a.1_d.3_g.4_y.4) ), here I summarized the main differences:\n\n* Dell pros: bigger SSD, fingerprint reader.\n* Lenovo pros: faster RAM, bigger battery, better screen brightness, lighter, digital pen included, longer warranty (2 years).\n\nMaybe the Dell has better build and screen quality? The Lenovo screen looks like a mirror, and it's quite annoying. But I will anyway mostly use it plugged to an external monitor.\n\nI saw the Lenovo in a shop and it looks nice and slim, but I am worried about the heat under stress, fans management and noise.\n\nWhat would you suggest based on my needs?",
  "What did you end up going with?",
  "Which one did you choose? I am also making this decision at the moment.",
  "I do have this exact Dell Inspiron since 2 days and I must say I’m very impressed by the chassi‘s build quality. The screen is quite dim but acceptable to me. When I did look up thing correctly you are even able to upgrade the ram to 64gb on your own, since it’s not soldered which is quite surprising to me. Compared to my Lenovo t14s gen4 the Dell Inspiron feels more sturdy to me. Compared to my zbook 14 gen 10 it comes close. But the Dell feels a lot heavier than the other two and the fans are quite audible. Also the cpu seems to throttle in my unit. My zbook has an amd ryzen 7840hs which gets a score of 800+ on cinebench r24. The ryzen 8840hs in my Dell only scores 600-700 (it is basically the same cpu but the 8840hs has a faster NPU for AI processing).\n\nI also tried Halo infinite on the Dell, just out of curiosity. On low preset I get around 50 - 60 fps.. the Dell comes with a 1920 x 1200 screen.\n\nThe zbook has the same igpu and comes with a 2560 x 1600 screen. Here I do manage to get stable 60- 80 fps on halo infinite.\n\nSo the same igpu scores a better frame rate, at a higher resolution than the Dell Inspiron.\n\nBut the price difference between those machine 850€ (Dell) to 1500-2200€ (zbook)\n\nI do not regret getting the Dell, I really do like it. For that price I think you will not find a laptop with such a good build chassis again.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the power switch at the side of Lenovo Yoga’s do convert the mechanic force from the side to another button which is located at the top of the motherboard. This mechanism fails more often and is very hard, if even possible to replace (of course it does not happen to every unit but the chances are higher than with a conventional power button)",

  "The cpu's (according to benchmarks) are almost identical in performance. The ultra 5 will have a much better igpu as arc is a big step up from iris, and it has an npu which is going to be more future proof and useful for ai related tasks. You also get the benefit of a 7 nanometer process, and more cores and threads. They both have really nice screens, although I would stay away from the oled display on the yoga as it would likely have burn in issues and reduce battery life. Finally the yoga has faster ram which can definitely make a difference. I'd say decide whether or not you'd be fine using an oled display on the yoga, and dealing with a few extra things (like auto hiding your taskbar, and using windows spotlight to change your background daily, and using dark mode). The yoga is the better laptop in my opinion.",

  "HP Spectre x360 vs. Lenovo Yoga 9-series Hey all! I have been using a Lenovo Yoga C940 since 2020 but the i5 and 8 GB of RAM have been letting me down recently. Other than the performance, I have loved the computer and want to know if I should stick with Lenovo for a new 2-in-1. I checked out an HP Spectre x360 today and really loved the design of that, but I'm not as familiar. I'm a college student and would use it for homework, notetaking, and some light coding.

  "Lenovo Yoga 710 14\" Review Video: [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lnk4Jm7l6ds)\n\n**Intro**\n\nUnveiled at MWC in February, 2016, it comes in three screen sizes: 11 inch, 14 inch and 15  inch. The model I bought is the 14 inch variant. This seems to be a successor to the Yoga 700. Even though the specs of the 710 are very similar to the 700, the 700 is currently out of stock everywhere, so it seems Lenovo may have discontinued the 700 a bit prematurely.\n\n\n**Specs**\n\n * Intel (Skylake) 6th generation core i7-6500u processor @2.5 GHz (Turbo boost up to 3.10 GHz)\n * 8GB DDR4 RAM (upgradable)\n * 256GB M.2 SSD on a SATA III interface (upgradable)\n * An NVIDIA GeForce 940MX GPU\n * 14” 1080p touch IPS display\n * 802.11ac (upgradable)\n * Bluetooth 4.1 (upgradable)\n * JBL speakers\n\n\n**Ports**\n\nOn the left side we have a power jack, a charging indicator light, an SD card slot, a headphone/microphone combo jack, and a small pinhole for accessing the recovery mode.\nOn the right side there’s a power indicator light, the power button, a micro HDMI port and two USB 3.0 ports. The last USB port is an “always on” port that you can use to charge your phone even when the laptop is off.\nOn the front there’s nothing and on the back there are plenty of ventilation holes and really solid hinges.\n\n\n**Keyboard**\n\nThe keyboard has two levels of backlighting which isn’t very evident when the lights are on, so one doesn’t really need backlighting in a well-lit room, unlike some other laptops as the key lettering has very good contrast. It is very similar in feel to the MacBook Pro keyboard, with the only quirk being that the right \"Shift\" key is to the right of the arrow keys and is smaller in size. It would take a bit of time to get used to it though.\n\n\n**Trackpad**\n\nThe trackpad is good and recognizes gestures well for the most part. It’s not a glass trackpad unfortunately, but that’s by no means a deal breaker.\n\n\n**Built**\n\nDimensions\nInches: 12.68\" x 8.78\" x 0.68\"\nmm: 322 x 223 x 17.3\nWeight: 3.42 lb (1.55kg)\nBeing a Yoga machine, you can use it in the four \"modes\" that Lenovo calls: Laptop mode, presentation mode, tent mode and tablet mode. Yes, it is a bit heavy for one-handed use and one wouldn't use it like an iPad as a tablet but is quite comfortable in tablet mode when sitting on a couch. \nBecause the entire body is made of aluminium, there’s no flex on the keyboard, or rather anywhere on the laptop. There screen is pretty rigid even when I try really hard to flex it. Same thing goes for the body of the laptop, it’s really well built. It’s got chamfered edges all around, which gives a really premium feel to the laptop and makes it quite comfortable to use in the \"tablet mode\", unlike the HP Spectre X360 which has very sharp edges.\n\nThere’s lots of ventilation, with the intake at the bottom and the exhaust ports at the back, which do a great job of pushing the heat away from the user. Since there are vents even at the top edge, so they won’t get blocked no matter how you place the laptop.\nAnother benefit of the entire body being made of aluminium, is that it also acts as a heatsink, which further assists in keeping the machine cool. There are two fans inside that rarely kick in under light to moderate use and are very silent when the do kick in. The only time the machine gets hot is under extreme load, like when rendering a video in a video editor. Even then the palmrest area and the touchpad are very cool to the touch.\n\nThe two hinges are absolutely solid. They're sufficiently stiff so the screen also doesn’t wobble back and forth much when tapping on in.\n\n**Display**\n\nThe screen is a 14 inch full HD one. Being an IPS display, the viewing angles are great even from extreme angles with no apparent color shifting. It’s not a super sharp QHD one like on the Yoga 900, but the upside of having a 1080p display is that it required much less power, as fewer number of pixels means less power is required. It’s a perfectly sharp display from normal viewing distance of 1.5 to 2 feet from the screen. The brightness gets up to 300 nits and has adaptive lighting which isn’t intrusive at all and can be easily disabled if needed. It supports 10-point multi touch and gestures like pinch to zoom work great. The bezels are super slim, almost like the InfinityEdge display on the Dell XPS 13 and 15. As a bonus, the 720p webcam is placed in the right position (the centre top of the screen). Opening the screen is definitely a two-handed affair as the screen is held down by what seems to be some very strong magnets. For connecting an external display, the micro HDMI port supports 4K displays.\n\n\n**Speakers**\n\nThe JBL branded speakers are downward firing and are decent enough to fill up a 16x12 feet room with sound. They don’t have much in the name of bass though (compared to my old machine: a 2011 Dell XPS L502X). It also comes with Dolby surround software and it does a surprisingly good job of making a virtual surround effect. I didn’t know about this and I kept getting up to look out the window wondering where certain sounds were coming from when I would be watching videos.\n\n\n**Battery life**\n\nThe battery life is really good for the Yoga 710. It comes with a 53 WHr battery. With the screen brightness set at 60% it lasts for over 9 hours with light web browsing (6-8 tabs open), some MS Office work and a few YouTube videos.\nIt has a “express charging” mode that you can enable which charges the battery almost 30% faster than normal. The charger is small and lightweight, making it easy to carry around in a backpack. I wish they would have retained the USB charging port from the Yoga 700 though.\n\n\n**Shortcomings**\n\n* No USB Type-C\n* No full-sized HDMI port\n* Only two USB ports\n* Small right \"Shift\" key\n\n\n**Price**\n\nIt retails for $799 in the US ($899 for i7) and Rs 85,000 in India at launch, which I feel makes it great value for money. \nWhere I live, the lower-spec Yoga 900 retails for $1850 (due to import duties), making it prohibitively expensive. I got the Yoga 710 for $1300 (which is the actual price for the Yoga 900) but I'm still happy with the purchase.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any questions you may have, I'll be glad to answer them.",

  "Hey man, you still got the laptop? I've had it for a few months now and I really dont like the build quality. Whenever I lift it or generally move it with one hand, or simply move the position of the screen it makes these cheap \"creaking\" noices (sort of similar to when you walk on old wooden floor , just quicker kinda). Like something you would expect out of a cheap plastic laptop. If I lift it up and \"wiggle it\" it makes these small sounds, and if I press the edge on the bottom of the keyboard/touchpad I can clearly hear and even feel it \"depress\" slightly, the metal clearly moves and is not really that stuck and solid. \n\nI love the laptop overall, but the build quality at times worries me. ",
  "The SSD is manufactured by Hynix, and all Lenovo laptops seem to have this manufacturer's components in them. Although I haven't run any benchmarks on it yet, but it seems to be at par or sometimes a bit faster than the Samsung 850 EVO I have in a separate machine, if that comparison helps. It can be easily swapped out as there's just a single screw holding it (as with all M.2 form factor SSDs). The BT and WiFi are on a single Broadcom chip and can easily be replaced as there are just the two cables and a screw holding it in place on the motherboard. I haven't had any issues with the signal and it seems to be doing a better job than the Intel wireless chip I have in my old laptop. The RAM is protected by an electromagnetic shield, which too can be removed by a couple of screws, giving access to the single DIMM memory, which I believe can be increased to a maximum of 16GB. Even the battery replacement (after some years) is extremely easy. I have opened up a fair number of laptops from various manufacturers in the past and this one scores very high on the reparability/replacement factor.",
  "I bought it from India from a lenovo retail store. I hope it becomes available from the website as well or you could try Amazon/Best Buy. \nI haven't been able to test it with any pen input, but since it doesn't come with a digitizer, I'm assuming that it won't really support any pen input, apart from the usual capacitive ones. \nIf portability is your main concern, then this laptop is fantastic, but then it's not a workstation laptop. For film editing, I suppose you could use it, but it's not the same as a dedicated desktop. I used DaVinci for editing a video and I had the free version, so it was a bit slow. I suppose rendering could be improved if I used a better software. But if your primary purpose is film editing, then I highly recommend that you wait a few days (if you can) and get a MacBook Pro. It really flies for video editing. But for all other purposes, I'd prefer a Windows machine. I hope this helps and really sorry for such a late reply.",

  "Hey there! I agree that it must feel really bad to see such issues coming up in such a new machine. I recently went with a friend to purchase the same laptop. When the sales rep opened up the box and started the machine, I could clearly see that there was a huge gap in the chassis, where the keyboard deck and the bottom plate meet. We refused to purchase that particular piece and walked out empty handed. Reading your experience and seeing what my friend almost bought, I consider myself lucky that I'm not facing any such issues. I'm frequently asked if I'm facing an issue with the fan being constantly running even at idle, but that too doesn't happen. Are you facing this particular issue too? \nHappy new year! ",

  "Thanks for the detailed reply! I think I'll get this whenever I save up enough.",
  "Happy new year to you too! Damn, glad to hear your friend was able to check the laptop before you purchased it! Seems like Lenovos quality control is extremely tacky. \n\nI sorta want to try to get my money back, but I guess the sales rep won't see my issues, especially not in a busy store with a lot of sound so they won't be able to hear the noises anyway. I mean, it really ain't something \"wrong\" as in the product still works, but it is annoying and obvsiouly a fault at production. The problem with getting my money back is that there is no other laptop in that price range that is as good as the 710 has potential to be.  I live the look, size, feel and speed of the 710. Too bad the build quality isn't as good as it should be. Do you not hear any noises at all if you lift your laptop with the corner and shake it a little or when having the screen in one position for awhile and then changing the position of the screen? \n\n\nAnd yes, while I do not have the fan issue was extreme as others, it does turn on fairly quickly even when doing non-intensive tasks. Seems like my laptop also almost always uses at least 50% of the RAM too. \n\n\n",

It's the budget 7320u and the 7520u that you'd want to avoid the most. They use the old Zen 2 architecture and only have 4 cores. Basically comparable to a 4th gen Ryzen 3, or a Ryzen 3 5300u. Shitty iGPU too.\n\nThe 7530u and 7730u are good if you're on a budget, they use the Zen 3 CPU architecture which still holds up very well and have 6 and 8 cores respectively.

If you can afford it they're amongst the best laptop CPUs you can get for Windows if you want good performance, a good iGPU and good battery life. The 8th gen Ryzens are basically the same as these 3. The new Ryzen AI 300 CPUs which have recently been release are now a better option than these.\n\nThere's also the HX CPUs like the Ryzen 7745HX, 7845HX, 7945HX and others which are basically desktop CPUs in a laptop.

It helps the OLED display work much better and reduce the mirror effect.  \n\nIndeed, the Galaxy Book5 Pro has it too, but the specs are not up to par.  If in fact the Yoga Pro 9i with tandem/touch is like a mirror, that would be a real shame.  I do not know why manufacturers are not including anti-reflective glass.

In fact, the Ultra 7 255H is more than I need. Unfortunately, they have \"bundled\" an $800 extra (Ultra 9 285H) if you want to get the 3.2K Tandem OLED display.

Putting it next to a Spectre 16 with Corning Gorilla DX, it is night and day.  The Spectre, though still has some reflection, is very subdued.  The Yoga shows my face and every light source behind me.  Again, this is with tandem and touch.  From my view, there is no anti-reflective treatment whatsoever.  U.S. model.",

They essentially double your battery life, as well has being handy when your phone is about to die too. \n\nThe laptop also does get hot. That is a notable concern, as thermal throttling is an issue, as with any other gaming laptop.

  "General info, judge the model not the manufacturer, if u are talking asus, they also had multiple lawsuits about crappy tech support , with cases of sending the wrong/lower model of the product, in a case they denied sending a replacement to a user cuz of the shipping issue on their side and went the lawsuit route to get it 3 months later\n\nSo here is asus for you, for Lenovo, depends on the model, on the business side, you already have the thinkpad series on top with the highest market share among the companies for a reason, same company makes ideapads, had very bad hinges/bad quality, though in the last generations they got better, like LOQ series are basically ideapads with older gen Legion chassis, and u got the Legions, u got the really sold unit with price cheaper than competition, with a community and support better than competition (due to market share ofc), lots of tweakers out there\n\nSome goes for other companies, hp famous for making laptops that lasts 2 years at most before hinges breaking,\n\nSame company makes Spectre x360 series that my cousin has for the last 8 years and got fked and yet still going, so yeah",

  "I have this laptop with the i9 chip and it's branded as the Slim Pro 9i, but it's the same as the Yoga. I would recommend it for general use, stationary gaming, and multimedia applications. It has tons of power, great speakers, and an amazingly vibrant and clear display. HOWEVER, it's probably overkill. It's very heavy and has terrible battery life. So unless you plan to park it on your desk and never move it, get something more portable and whose battery will at least last though the end of class.",
  "I find that any of the Asus Zenbooks are great for school and have great build quality and design. I would go for their mid tier ones or get a slightly older model, they are perfect for school and can handle some editing if you want it to. Search up reviews to understand what I mean.",
  "I have been seeing quite a few comments on this thread where they are either confusing this with the 2023 model, a 2in1 model and some were even referring SKUs with AMD CPUs which this laptop never even had to begin with, so let me clear this up a bit. \n\nI'd like you to confirm one thing, which is whether you'll need a dGPU because if your work doesn't need it, then you can get laptops with similar specs but without the rtx4050 for less than $1000. Not all codes and programming will depend on GPU, most of them only rely on a powerful CPU. \n\nIf you do need a dGPU, then this would be a pretty decent laptop choice for this price, particularly because of the amazing build quality. This has better battery life than the 2023 model, and should suffice for your needs. This is not a Yoga 2 in 1, which usually have weaker hinges like some comments mention. This has a better and sturdier hinge than those. Not the best hinge, but then again, that's the case for all the manufacturers rn except maybe for Apple and this is better than the ones with plastic lids.\n\nHowever there are better alternatives based on your usecases. If you want a touchscreen, then this is the best one for this price unless you go above $1500. Keep in mind that this is ~2.2kg, it is almost the same as the 16\" MacBook Pro for reference, so you have to decide that you are fine with that. If not, go for something like Asus Zephyrus G16 2024 edition, but you'll lose on the touchscreen and numpad. You can also look at Asus Proart P16 which gives you both numpad and touchscreen. You can also look at some other gaming laptops like LOQs and Legions, they will have slightly better performance, however their build quality is lower than this and they have not as good webcam, mics etc and have much worse speakers and similar weight, if not more. \n\nIn comparison, this is a more all-rounder laptop. If you can stay connected to a power source and are fine with a single type c port (which is TB4, so you can still use high speed docks), then you can also look at the 2023 edition (called Slim Pro 9i in US). Best buy has manufacturer refurbished model (so you still get 1yr warranty from Lenovo and all the perks of a brand new laptop) for less than this price and it includes a mini LED screen, which is much better and brighter. \n\nHope this helps 🙂",

  "Laptop comparison: Zenbook14 (amd) vs Yoga slim 7 intel vs Yoga slim 7 gen 10(amd) I just graduated and am planning on buying my second laptop.

  "New Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Review: The laptop for most people This is my review of the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, which has been hyped up as the “supreme being” of Chromebooks thanks to the new MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. I’m just a regular tech nerd who loves Chromebooks but can still look at things objectively, especially when something costs close to $800. This is an honest review, no marketing fluff of just reading the specs. I do reviews as a hobby because I genuinely love tech and enjoy spreading the gospel.\n\nWhile I was overall impressed, I think this machine is overhyped, mainly because of the chip. It’s not quite ready for the big leagues in some areas. I’m coming from using devices like my Galaxy Tab S9+ with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which **EATS UP** anything I throw at it (AI, photo/video editing, multi tasking, video calls). That’s my dream: give me that level of power from a Galaxy Tab S series in a Chromebook with a great keyboard with zero compromises.\n\nSo here’s my category breakdown after using the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for a week, alongside my trusty daily driver, the [HP Chromebook x360 14c](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-first-impressions-great-build-quality-in-a-smallish-high-performing-package/) (i3/8GB RAM), which is still a beast since 2021.\n\n**-----------------**\n\n# 🔧 Build & Design\n\nThe Lenovo is thin and light, but solid. It gives off premium MacBook vibes in build quality, especially when typing. It's so light, it almost feels like a dummy unit, but clearly isn’t. It definitely feels like the next generation of Chromebook hardware.\n\nOnly downside? The bottom is plastic, so it lacks that full premium unibody feel. But unless you’re carrying it around a lot, it’s a non-issue. People mentioned keyboard flex but I didn’t experience any in daily use. And I’m a weightlifter and former lineman with 10.5-inch bear paws. I only got flex when I intentionally tried to flex the keyboard by pressing hard.\n\nThe hinge is firm, you can’t open it with one hand, but once open, it holds its position perfectly.\n\nCompared to the HP 14c, the Lenovo is a little longer and wider but way thinner and lighter. My HP is a full aluminum tank, it’s been a champ for years. The Lenovo feels like it’ll hold up, but its lighter build will need to prove itself over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cx1remd5ugf1.jpg?width=3946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fc512c4967fd3d9b6ea3b537f575ffb690dff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m1a8ard5ugf1.jpg?width=3924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efab4b1846b64e7727b72556ddd716a9c3daaf11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdn5xkwd5ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665327d55e809b4a4685834ce4593af80b4fe985\n\n**Build Grade: A**\n\n**-----------------------------------**\n\n# 🔋 Battery Life\n\nLet’s be real: I never got anywhere near the advertised 17 hours. But that’s OK, because I still got a solid 9–10.5 hours under heavy, real-world use:\n\n* 20–30 tabs open\n* Zoom app + Teams (web)\n* YouTube music streaming\n* Constant typing\n* Screen at \\~70%\n\nCompared to my aging HP, which lasts about 4–5 hours now, this is a major win. For comparison, the [HP Dragonfly Pro ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review-the-pixelbook-of-2023/)from 2023 with an i5 is the worst battery life I ever had on a high powered Chromebook that gave me a max of 3 hours. That thing didn’t last the weekend before it went back.\n\n**Battery Grade: A+**\n\n**-------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⌨️ Keyboard, Trackpad & Fingerprint Reader\n\nTyping on this was a breeze, even with my bear paws. No real keyboard flex during regular use. The keys feel a little shallower than on the HP 14c, but once I got into a groove, I had no complaints.\n\nTrackpad is large, smooth, and accurate, feels close to a MacBook in responsiveness. No lag, no misclicks.\n\nThe fingerprint reader? 🔥 One of the best I’ve used on a Chromebook or any computer. I tried to fake it out with weird angles and different parts of my finger, but nope, still unlocked instantly.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**----------------------------**\n\n# 🔊 Sound & Speakers\n\nThe Dolby-branded speakers had me hopeful, but they’re great for a Chromebook, but average overall. My HP PC from 2013 would blow these out of the water, so it's nothing special there. They do have more depth than 99% of all Chromebooks and are a little louder overall, it's still Chromebook speakers, so they are decent in a small room.\n\nThe HP DragonFly Pro was also hyped up to have amazing speakers, but again, good for a chrombook, but in real-world usage, they are just ok.\n\n**Grade: C overall | B+ for a Chromebook**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------**\n\n# ⚡ Chip & Performance: Kompanio Ultra 910\n\nHere’s where the hype train slows down.\n\nIn benchmarks (Jetstream, Speedometer), this chip was twice as fast as my HP’s i3. In real-world use? Not really. It’s only slightly faster, like a 0.5-1 second lead in page loads, even for heavy sites like ESPN and data heavy Google Sheets.\n\nYes, it wins technically.... but it was often a photo finish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erj1q9w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9612c64acde7e2224c924ad258d9bfc6a111dcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0brf8w35ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cad7a55498ced4378d570f2a42a10285385f394\n\nI **ran into consistent problems** using Teams in the browser. Video calls would freeze, the screen would stutter, and it even blinked to black unless I turned off the camera. Reddit confirms I’m not alone on this. Zoom (via app) worked fine, but Teams was rough. No such issues on my HP.\n\nBut, the Mediatek chip does allow you to download ALL of THE APPS in the Play Store, which opens up the full world of Android on your Chromebook. The i3 in my HP doesnt allow that, and each day more and more apps that I could download are no longer supported, so that gives it the edge to usher in the full Android Laptop experience, as some of the apps would be better on a full-screen computer with a keyboard compared to the phone.\n\nI tried video editing on the Lenovo using my favorite video editing app on Android called [InShot](https://inshot.com/), and it temporarily presented a dream come true, to have InShot on a laptop, not a tablet with an added on keyboard, where I could edit videos comfortably on my lap. But then I tried to edit together 4 different 15-second 4k files, and that's when it went to crap fast. As soon as I added in a transition, it became super laggy and jittery, and adding in more transitions and text almost made the computer quit. So video editing on the Lenovo is not ideal.\n\n**Video editing on this is about as good as a groundhog trying to make a beaver dam; it looks like it should work, and has the same shape and characteristics, but no, it won't do at all.**\n\nAI features like background blur or object removal? Not there yet. Definitely nowhere near Galaxy S phones or tablets.\n\nMy last point about the chip is, why not use past (1-2 year old) true flagship chips that can do it all, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (from the Galaxy Tab S9 series)? If they are going to charge such a premium price and say it's because of the chip, bring in a true elite chip that can handle everything like AI, multitasking, video editing, and more, all at the same time, and then Chrome OS would be a monster.\n\n**Grade: B**\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# 📺 Screen & Camera\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ualptw55ugf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23693f067cae0fa1665c752c8052afbdcf8eb7f5\n\n\n\nNow this screen, WOW. It’s a 2K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful. I watched an [8K Planet Earth video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JWxHy0C_pI&list=RD6JWxHy0C_pI&start_radio=1) and it felt like I could reach into the screen and touch it. The best screen I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Also, they list the Lenovo at 400 nits, but it feels much brighter than 400. I kept the screen constantly at 60-70% and that was perfect for me in all of my use cases.\n\nBUT… a few things:\n\n* Some images/web pages looked oversaturated\n* No screen tuning or adjustment in ChromeOS\n\nThe camera is also surprisingly good. Not Galaxy Ultra good, but very usable for video calls even in tricky lighting.\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n**------------------------------------**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is a great machine and a peek into the future of Chromebooks, especially with ARM chips. The design is sleek (though I wish they offered a deep gray or navy blue), the screen is stellar, battery is excellent, and it handles most tasks with ease.\n\nFor most users who use nothing but web apps (Google Docs, Office, email, YouTube) this is more than enough. People spending $2,000 for email machines should seriously consider this and Chrome OS as an alternative.\n\nBUT… looking at the complete picture of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, this would be the no-brainer recommendation of the year (for any laptop, especially a Chromebook) at $500, as $750 feels like a reach when you can get a MacBook Air for $850. If Best Buy does their normal act of putting this on deep discount after a couple of months, and this goes down to $450-550 for a new one, **run**, don't walk to get one if you need a new laptop. At that price, this is the no-brainer Chromebook of the decade.\n\n**Overall Grade: B+**\n\nMe and my bear paws are off to test the next device.",
  "This is cool, but for $800, it better deliver without hiccups. Why risk it when you can grab a MacBook Air for a bit more?",
  "I have found my LCP14 to be fast, but I think the glowing performance reviews may be a bit overstated. I get some freezing/non-loading tabs with maybe 7-10 open (some of them being Google Docs or Gmail), which was unexpected. I also noticed it can't handle 16k (4320p) videos with 60fps on YouTube—not that this is a dealbreaker by any means, but I was still surprised. I typically use that as a test for a machine's horsepower.\n\nI assume all this has to do with the ARM processor and the extended battery life, which may come at a cost. The above tasks would never challenge my HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, but that machine had historically bad battery life. Overall, I'm happy with the LCP14 so far, but I thought I'd add this context.",
  "This is the review I've been looking for and have been going back and forth with a MacBook Air for the exact reason on price. I don't want to switch my ecosystem so I'll wait for a sale. Thanks for your hard work!",
  "Great review, thanks a lot. Very well written and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nEdit: I have one more question. How well or poorly does the touch display respond? And were you able to test Android games on it? Did they run better or worse than on Intel devices?\n\nTwo questions. Those were two questions. Sorry.",
  "Thanks for the insightful review! One question though, as I couldn't find this information anywhere. How far does the screen open? Maybe show pictures of maximum opening angle or a value in degrees would be fantastic :)",
  "[deleted]",
  "Well for those of us who love Chrome OS, its an alternative to Windows that faster and lighter, but as you mentioned for this price, it needs to be flawless, or we can grab a MacBook \n\nLike I said, for around $500 this is great, at its current price and chip flaws I see why people are taking it back (I have seen this a lot on here)",
  "See, you are a person who has actually used the machine and not just had one tab open and is hyping the machine up.   The Lenovo is fast, but the jitters and lag it has when doing real-world stuff are unacceptable for me at that price.  As I said, comparing it to my HP Chrombook with an i3 from 2021, they are neck and neck in real-world speed tests, but the i3 never stutters with 20 tabs open, playing 4k videos, and video calling at the same time. \n\nYes, the battery life is not great on my older HP, but I never experienced any hiccups like I did on the Lenovo, just doing what we have come to consider basic things, like video calling, when the Lenovo about aborted on me. \n\nI think the Mediatek chip is ok, but it's not as powerful as they make it seem.  As I said in my review, they need to take older top of the line chips like thise from a Galaxy s tab and put it into the Chromebook so that it cna do EVERYTHING with ease, and then it will be perfect.",
  "So which one are you going to get, the MacBook or the Lenovo?",
  "Thanks, I appreciate you!!\nThe touch screen is amazing, no issues the at all and it was good to use at times for certain things but it does leave a lot of smudges on the screen. \n\nGaming I don't do, but there's a video by Lon Sibon on YouTube that he talks about gaming.  Again I'm not sure how it will hold up because the chip is not as strong as they make it seem, you can download all the apps yes, but raw power is questionable in real world use cases as I mentioned.",
  "It goes all the way flat, or 180 degrees and the hinge is very firm  \nThis is not a convertible.  But, Acer is launching a 514 chrombook plus with this chip in it next month that will be a convertible and I think they will have he chip tuned better than I experinced on this Lenovo",
  "I agree with you, and the fact that the chip was struggling with certain task makes it even worse \n\n$450-500 it's a steal, but anything above $550 is a no",
  "I'm leaning Lenovo because of the ecosystem, but the m3 or m4 MacBook Air is on sale for ~$800 and seems like it would have better longevity than what the Lenovo may have (both based on past experience). I have a Lenovo duet 5 now which I love but the snapdragon is feeling a little long in the tooth when I have more than a few tabs open.\n\nI guess my heart says Lenovo but brain said MacBook Air.",
  "Thanks a lot for the feedback! 180 degrees would be perfect for me. I got a Acer Spin 513 (the one with the previous top ARM model) which is a convertible, but it turned out I hardly use it as a tablet. 95% only as a laptop. Having good speakers is a great bonus for the Lenovo for me, as well as a bright screen. Don't need maximum power as for heavy workload I want to rely on remote desktops.",
  "Check your local best buys, in my area (SE Michigan) the Lenovo is on BB as a used excellent for $530 which is the right price point. So see if you can find one in your area for that price",
  "Unfortunately not near me but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nWhat do you think the chances of the kompanio lasting close to apple silicon?",
  "Not sure, thats a ChatGPT quesiton lol \n\nHappy hunting, hopefully you can find one soon.   I hear that they are high-end Chromebooks with Spandragon x Elite processors coming; I'm hoping they are here just before the holiday season.",
  "Ended up with the m4 MacBook air. It went on sale on Amazon for 750(!) and I can't find the Lenovo near me. Also mixed in the surface laptop for fun but the air just seems too good. Thanks again for your help!",
  "Lenovo Yoga 7 Pro vs Asus Zenbook 14 OR Lenovo Yoga 2 in 1 vs Zenbook S14 Hi, so I am looking for a premium thin and light powerful laptop with great battery life in the premium segment. I have shortlisted to 2 categories and 4 laptops which I have mentioned in the title.\nHere are some basic configurations :-\n1) Lenovo Yoga 7 Pro \n- Intel core ultra 9 285H\n- 3K Oled display\n- Intel arc 140T graphics card\n- 32GB RAM / 1TB SSD \n- Aura édition 8853 MT/s\n- Touch\n\n2) Asus Zenbook 14\n- Intel core ultra 9 285H\n- 3K Oled display\n- Intel arc 140T graphics card\n- 32GB RAM / 1TB SSD\n- Normal édition and less than 8853 MT/s\n- Touch and stylus support\n\n-> 3) & 4) Both have Intel core ultra 7 258V processor which I'm worried won't be sufficient for tasks such as light gaming even. \n\nPlease provide your valid inputs with your reviews and also I would consider yoga 7 Pro but it comes in a single color which I found a little bit unsatisfactory than the zenbook's looks.\nInputs are welcome! Thanks\n\nP.S. - I am going to buy the laptop tomorrow so I need quick suggestions please.",
  "I have the Zenbook 14 (mine has the 1920x1200 OLED, otherwise specs as you listed) and would definitely recommend it. In mixed use (some Youtube, web browsing, a couple hours playing 9 Kings) I've been getting 8-9 hours of screen on time out of the battery, and performance has been excellent. Battery might be slightly better or worse on Windows (I am using Debian Linux), but for the performance I think that much battery life is still mindblowing. The hardware is 100% a premium device. If I could do it over, I would buy this laptop again.",
  "Damn, but didnt you consider yoga 7 Pro cuz it has better features otherwise",
  "Been looking everywhere for someone who has this OLED! The 3k doesn’t appear to be available in the UK. Do you have the reported issues with seeing dots on the digital layer for the touch screen? Do you do a lot of reading and typing as supposedly it’s not great for that either?\nFinally, how is wifi 7 card?\nThank you",
  "I did not. The Yoga 7 Pro doesn't appear to be readily available in the US (where I live) in anything close to the spec you listed, so that takes it out of the running for me. I did find a listing for $200 more than I paid for the Zenbook, which doesn't inspire me much. Are the prices for the two similar where you are?",
  "> Do you have the reported issues with seeing dots on the digital layer for the touch screen?\n\nI don't; however, those seem to be reported by people who view a lot of white backgrounds. I just checked out a white background myself to try to look for it and I *think* I saw a little of it on a fully white screen, but frankly the sheer amount of white light was far more offensive than any pattern that may or may not have been there. With anything not majority pure-white I can pretty confidently say it's not an issue.\n\n> Do you do a lot of reading and typing as supposedly it’s not great for that either? \n\nNot sure how a screen would be bad for typing, personally - if this is re: the keyboard, I have found it to be very solid as far as laptop keyboards go. Primary use case for this for me is as a web browsing machine/capable PC on the go, but it is not my main PC. I have not noticed anything that would lead me to say it's not great for reading, though.\n\n> Finally, how is wifi 7 card?\n\nWorks well, though I can't speak to the Windows-specific aspects of it. No complaints once it was up and running (If you're a Linux user, it wasn't detected by the Debian installer, so I had to use a USB-C-to-Ethernet dongle to get the OS installed; worked fine out of the box once the OS install was complete. If you're a Windows user I am sure it will be perfectly fine out of the box.).\n\nOverall, I'm really happy with this laptop. I bought it as a secondary device as mentioned, but I could happily use it as my main PC (outside of graphically-demanding games) if needed. It's got tons of power in an extremely portable form factor with an excellent screen, which is exactly what I wanted from it.",
  "Well well it's even about a 100$ cheaper here the yoga",
  "Really appreciate you taking the time to reply, thank you.\nI think the reading/typing comment was tied to the screen in the sense of it being suitable for that type of work (coding, desktop publishing etc) vs gaming/entertainment, but I’m satisfied hearing from a real world not review world use case. \n\nI’m probably going to go for ultra 7 rather than 9 - my use case won’t really benefit from the extra power when the trade off for the power is slightly less battery time , and more heat and subsequent fan noise. \n\nThat conclusion is also formed from reviews though, so if you’ve an opinion on that I’m all ears! (I will be running Windows)",
  "I may be wrong (going off of the US website as that is where I am based) but it looks like the Ultra 7 variant is the older 155H, whereas if you want the current crop of CPUs the Ultra 9 285H is the only option; from what I was able to find the 155H and 285H get similar battery life, but you get a healthy chunk more performance with the 285H (as you'd hope). If the pricing is similar imo go for the 9. Haven't found heat or noise to really be an issue with this machine anyway (yes the fan can be heard when it's on like any laptop, and yes putting a big fat 16 core CPU into a thin and light chassis like this means the fan will be coming on regularly - that will be the case both with the 155H and the 285H, so I would not consider it a factor in purchase decisions personally). Obviously, if the 155H meets your needs and comes at a decent discount, then it makes sense to go for it.",
  "Laptop thoughts suggestion This is the laptop I’m interested in buying, hoping it goes on sale for Black Friday! I’m curious if there are cheaper laptops that are similar.

  "HP Victus Ryzen 7 (more stats in pic) for basic gaming?

  "This is a nice budget gaming laptop, and for that price, I would get it.",
  "For the price, it isn't too bad.\n\nKeep in mind that the CPU is not really a Ryzen 7, it's based on Phoenix 2, the low end to mid range CPU die.\n\nThe 7445HS is closest to a R5 8500G or R5 7545U.\n\nSomething like the R5 7640H is faster than the R7 7445HS",

  "Np man, i just wanted to point that out so that any comparisons are easier if you find alternatives while in store or smth",
  "i appreciate it, i don't know much about laptops hence why i bought a surface go 3 lol",
  "What would be the better option between these two? HP seems to be better value. So I currently have a Lenovo Yoga 7i pretty the much the same specs as the 9i I would just appreciate the OLED screen and 2-in-1 capabilities. My plan was to originally return the 7i and pay the extra $100 for the OLED screen, and 2 in 1 capabilities. But when looking again, I found this HP for even cheaper with seemingly better specs. The 2tb SSD seems pretty sweet plus a slightly more powerful processor. What I'm worried about tho is I hear a lot of talk of HP's software and battery life as well as the build quality not being as good as the Lenovo's, so im wondering how true this is, and if it would be worth it to get the HP for the cheaper price, the Ultra 9, and the extra tb of storage. If it matters im currently in high and planning to use the laptop for an IT degree throughout college. Idk if this is correct or not but I think the HP's have more upgradeability as well?

  "The discrepancy here is that the Yoga 9i Aura isn't discounted like the OmniBook X Flip is. You never want to purchase a laptop at MSRP 'cause they're all overpriced.\n\nThat said, if these two were similarly priced, you should pick based on display size 'cause that's the biggest difference here; essentially 14\" vs 16\". That, or the stock SSD. I believe both laptops are upgradeable in this department, but you won't need to think about it if you have 2TB.\n\nThe Yoga 9i Aura should beat the OmniBook X Flip in build quality, or just overall quality across the board. The OmniBook X series is a lower mid-range series more comparable to the Yoga 7i (and even in that comparison, the Yoga 7i is considered better built, of the two in 2025), while the Yoga 9i Aura is premium class. The OmniBook Ultra series is more premium than the OmniBook X and broadly comparable to the Yoga 9i Aura.\n\nMy advice is to wait for a discount on the Yoga 9i Aura if you want to upgrade, but that's 'cause I trust the build quality and keyboard quality (coming from a current 2025 Yoga 7i owner), and I'm more partial to a 14\" display.",
