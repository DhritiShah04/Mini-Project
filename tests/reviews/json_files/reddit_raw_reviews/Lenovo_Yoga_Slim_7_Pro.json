  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",
  "This is why I'm planning to upgrade my X1 carbon g5 to g13. It will be expensive, but it will be worth it I hope.",
  "i have one, i love it and find it enjoyable but im not a lappy connoisseur like you ive only had desktops for last decade, i will monitor this touchpad thing and touchscreen issue, but i use a bt mouse mostly, and i dont have this glow on the screen, or not that i notice, everything else seems manageable\n\ntry one more replacement, what other options are there right now? i dont think it looks or feels cheap. i like same things as you, the usb c on both sides, i like the weight and solid feel, the shiny bright screen, speakers, fast solid bt and wifi, keyboard, low bloatware, amazing battery and playing gta v\n\nmy bt 5.3/4 can let me use my earphones all the way in the shower room which i couldnt do with my previous 5.1 or whatever, thats big life immprovement for me\n\ni feel the top function row of keys the backlight bleeds through the bottom of the row a bit much depending on angle but not a big deal",
  "This is a very interesting review. Currently not many reviews for this model. Have you got chance to try other Lunar Lake models?",
  "Nice review! Would you mind sharing how the Aura's screen compares to the SL7 you previously had? And how the fan noise in the SL7 was for you in the same setup you mentioned with external monitor?",
  "Thanks for this insightful review.\nRegarding the fan noise, is it possible to use tpfancontrol (or more recent) to customise it ? On both T15 (Gen 1) and L14 they work well to start the fan sooner than the firmware does, but I do not know whether it is possible to delay the fan startup...\nThanks,\nP.S. : additional question : what is the lowest rpm that tpfancontrol can achieve ?",
  "I noticed a big difference in performance after uninstalling the bloatware. Battery is great, response is snappy, touchpad is fine, not great, screen is lovely.

Best non Mac I’ve ever owned, and I think the x1 carbon will be better in terms of build quality but couldn’t see myself doubling the cost for materials and same specs. \n\nAll in all, a very solid, reliable piece of equipment.",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down. Also the laptop self shut down in standby mode e.g. overnight or for a couple of hours not of use\n\nCasual gaming like Valorant is working good and the 15'' IPS panel so far is great! also the thin and lightweight build.\n\nBut Im not 100% sure if I want to keep it. Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",
  "For me, the biggest issues so far:\n\n1. Occasional phantom touches - similar to the OP\n\n2. eGPU compatibility (GPD G1) - it used to work with meteor lake laptop which I had (YogaBook 9i).

  "  \nI have had this laptop for a week. I have updated everything that needed updating (Windows and all relevant drivers). Everything is fine except for the Wi-Fi, which is very slow. I usually connect it to my phone’s hotspot (an S23 Ultra), and when I tested it with Ookla Speedtest, the download speed never exceeded 180 kb/s (0.18 Mb/s), while the upload speed reached up to 4 Mb/s. It’s been so bad that I couldn’t download files from OneDrive, nor have I been able to install Quick Share due to the slow speeds.\n\nI have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website and followed various troubleshooting steps (including disabling IPv6, resetting the Wi-Fi driver, restarting, etc.). The connection was so poor that I couldn’t even complete the online Lenovo hardware self-diagnosis.\n\nWhat can I do? I bought this from BestBuy in the U.S., but I’m currently not in the United States. While returning it is not impossible, it would be very difficult, and I would prefer to resolve the issue without having to return it.",

  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues.

For example, unless it's one of the newest MacBook pros, you might be used to an incredibly glossy screen that leads to a busted user experience if there are windows or uncontrolled lights nearby.\n\nMy M1 Max MacBook Pro was also incredibly laggy for things like window snapping and some other things where I couldn't get rid of the animation and you just have to wait for part of a second from time to time before you can do things.\n\nPretty amazing that it compares to a multi-thousand dollar laptop, but also multi-thousand dollar laptops these days can be pretty disgusting, or at least that has been my experience with the M1 Max, and some Windows laptops from Dell, Asus, and Framework being laggy with windows 11.\n\nMaybe it's just a software problem though and I shouldn't be comparing wildly inefficient operating systems like Mac OS and Windows 11 to things like debloated Windows 10 or Linux on a 12-year-old Thinkpad originally rated for 24 hours of battery life.",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "How do the speakers compare to the MBP?  Thx",
  "I currently have the G16 and the aura and when it comes to speaker quality, these two are pretty close. the G16 has a slightly fuller bass and slightly wider sound stage. In my opinion if the G16 are a 10, the Aura speakers are a 9.5. I also feel the browsing experience to be much better on the Aura. I experience more lag on the G16 and the fans kick on, the SOC can get too hot for the G16 to sit on the lap, even with light browsing. That being said the track pad on the G16 is better. while the keyboard on the Aura is much better",
  "I was thinking of buying this but it has way too much bass, since I listen to music a lot that's a dealbreaker for me. Also, the bass resonates across the laptop body which creates a weird sensation if you're typing while listening to music. I tried adjusting equalizer in dolby software but still couldn't get the sound right. Did you find a solution to eliminate bass (so chassis doesn't resonate) and music becomes clear?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "I just did, looks good from any angle.",
  "Thanks for your review. I finally decided not to buy this model (it's in my cart for a few days).",
  "Thanks for the insight. Where did you see others complaining about the touchpad issue? If it's not isolated to my machine I'm afraid it may be drivers / firmware.",
  "sounds like an issue with Intel ultra series 2 to be honest.  \n  \ncan anyone who has tested other series 2 intel laptops confirm?",
  "I wud return it for the annoying spinning wheel alone",
  "I wish the X1 carbon line still had good IPS panels. OLED isn't for me. P14s gen 5 has a nice 120hz 3k IPS, I might consider that one.",
  "Hey, I'm thinking of picking up this machine, but I'm curious to know how much battery life you're getting?",
  "Haven't tried any other Lunar Lake laptops as of yet. There will allegedly be a SL7 for business with Lunar Lake next year, thinking about waiting for that. Though knowing Microsoft they'll charge an arm and a leg for 32Gb.",
  "I also posted a review of SL7 a few months ago if you wanted to have a look. The SL7's display is pretty comparable to the Aura's. It had worse PPI (201 vs 222), and worse subjective calibration making it bit washed out, but didn't have the IPS glow issues of the Aura. The AR coating was also better. I'd take either display, both good IPS panels.\n\nThe Surface was pretty much silent at all times, largely due to an overly conservative fan curve. The chassis would get way too warm in heavier tasks and the fan would hardly do anything. But still, I prefer the SL7's acoustics. No noise in a docked setup.",
  "Cant seem to get it working on the Aura.",
  "What did you uninstall? ",
  "Which bloatware did you remove?",
  "is the IPS display good for an external use? I work from home and sometimes i'd like to work from outside in the garden (emails, office Suite)",
  "Thanks for the recommendation on uninstalling the bloatware.  Any update on the laptop?",
  "It's annoyingly reflective. And it's a pitty because under the perfect conditions it's really nice to look at. But it's a laptop so conditions change and are rarely perfect",
  "Is it a problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "The low RPM noise isn’t too bad, it’s just the fact it’s there at all that irks me. It’s completely unnecessary to have such an aggressive fan curve with a Lunar lake chip inside, but I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker. \n\nThe eye strain comes from the GPU, not the glossy display surface. Same strain when docked. Seems to be recent intel GPU’s from what I’ve read, causing issues for those sensitive to dither, or whatever rendering technique it is that causes the pain.",
  "The Aura screen dimensions are compatible with the MacBook Air 15. Get a MBA 15 compatible matte screen protector, and it'll greatly reduce glare and reflections on the Aura.",
  "was this 16 or 32gb of ram?",
  "BTW, as an update to my experience, I have my touchscreen replaced as it seems to be touchscreen issue instead of touchpad. For a week, touchwood, no such touchpad issues anymore.\n\nThe only remaining gripe I have would be the lack of compatibility with my GPD G1.",
  "Have you uninstalled McAfee already? It will greatly improve system performance. The Microsoft antivirus software built in Windows is better. That's probably the first thing to do after unpacking a new Lenovo laptop.",
  "It's really subjective. Do you have any issues with other modern devices? In laptops I find Intel Xe iGPU's to be bad for eye strain, Nvidia perfectly fine, AMD tolerable but not ideal.",
  "For my ghost touches issue, turns out I went to Lenovo repair centre to have screen replaced, then as of these weeks the ghost touch issue is gone for me.",
  "how did it go? did you send it in and is it still working?",
  "Hello \n\nI am going to buy this laptop soon.\n\nIs there display glare problem a deal breaker?  \nSome people mentioned : glossy displays leading to poor battery life because you have to crank up brightness to max to combat glare.\n\nThanks",
  "Its not easy to buy a laptop nowadays. many models and there are issues on each model. No windows laptop is perfect it seems, unless you pay big amount to Thinkpad series highend one.",
  "Luckily the 15.3\" screen is the same size as the Macbook Air 15, so you could pick up a matte screen protector.",
  "[I just reviewed it](https://smbtech.au/features/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-aura-edition-laptop-review/) and got 26.5 hours. That's a new record on my site.",
  "After using for some time, I think it’s similar to surface laptop screen. It’s reflective but with decent resolution. Colors are vibrant. I mostly work inside so it’s been fine. Working outside might be slightly tough because the screen is pretty reflective (not as good coating as MacBook). If you turn up the brightness to 100% that might make it better for outside work.",
  "I think the same, if not even better.   So loud and clear and good bass too.   I've tested both the 14\" and the 15.3 and had zero issues.  I think the one this person is talking about was just a lemon",
  "Not really, I just got used to it.",
  "Barely but yes. You can be outside (in the shade of course) and make do while in light mode. It's a mirror though, so you gotta find the right angle.",
  "Thank you so much - I really appreciate it. This makes it a buy for me. ",
  "Glad I could help make that tough decision! Not many choices right now that are similar to Yoga 7i Aura Edition but hoping we get some new releases soon...",
  "I read about a couple folks mentioning unresponsive touchpad in some YouTube comments and in r/lenovo comments as well",
  "You probably don't need this anymore but its around 8 hours minimum for demanding stuff, WAY higher with regular use. Much more than one needs. If you plan on using it for several days in a row, just bring the charger.",
  "As I sit here looking at my non-upgradeable to Windows 11 Surface Book 2.  You felt and looked premium, I paid a lot for your middle tier processor, I learned what heat throttling was, sometimes you think the screen is disconnected when it isn't, we had a good run. No more MS laptops for me thanks.",
  "Just read it, some great detailed insights there. Definitely swaying me towards getting the SL7, especially given the low/no noise from the fans which is very important to me. Thanks for replying!",
  "How would you compare the screen reflectivity between the SL7 and the Aura? Still waiting for my Aura to arrive",
  "OK, thanks for trying, it is good to know that it is not compatible... by the way, there are several variants, depending on the model (eg 1 or 2 fans) : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qjlal2/tpfan_control_on_newer_thinkpads_share_your/\n\nOn the Aura, there is also a built-in BIOS configured power management, accessible through Fn+Q command : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1fufeoa/lenovo_yoga_slim_7i_aura_edition_ama/lqcjek5/",
  "What if you set the performance/fan mode to quiet? Does that make it quiet enough? I'm thinking of getting this too and have heard mixed reviews about fan noise",
  "Ya, it’s been hit or miss on battery life. Touchpad gets finicky w longer use, appears to be pretty sensitive to the oils on the skin and any grime so I try to use the mouse. I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",
  "Its actually not too bad in person (at best buy) when viewed side by side to the book 4 screen.   I think the book 5 screen has more anti-reflective coating and they did not have that model for testing.",
  "Is the reflection problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "Does anyone tried this?",
  "It had been on sales for £1100 for the Aura 258V 32GB RAM model in the UK (e.g. Lenovo Store, Currys).",
  "Yes the 32 GB version with Intel 258V. Seems like some of the discounts are now gone.",
  "I have the same ghost touch issue, sending it in for repair under warranty in 2 days.  \nhow was you experience with the repair and is it still working?  \nAsking since i have heard many bad things about Lenovo's repair service.",
  "May i ask if you’ve found a solution for connecting to the gpd g1? I am looking to buy a compact egpu to use with the slim 7i aura on the go. 🙏",
  "That was one of the first things I did",
  "I'm looking to replace an old Dell XPS 9360 laptop with the following specs: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz 2.00 GHz. If I had no eye strain issues with this, do you think I should be ok with the Slim 7i Aura?",
  "Tell me how the type of graphics card can affect eye strain. Eye strain and other discomforts are caused by PWM and temporal dithering. These are defects or characteristics of displays, and intervening components are unlikely to be the cause, but I could be wrong. Please comment.",
  "I exchanged it",
  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast. The screen is very glossy though. if you work in a very bright room with bright background/light behind you, then yeah it can be very annoying to clearly see your reflection on the screen even at 80% brightness. it's depends see if you can find a sample in the nearest store.",
  "I like your little candy cane for scale",
  "Can you share me the settings that you have used while testing this and was there any major tweaks done to this? I got the same laptop but seems like my idle drain is little bit higher, although I did clean install of windows.",
  "Is it good?",
  "HP's new OmniBook Flip looks good, but its battery is a bit small. Maybe I'll wait for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura edition. It'll be very expensive at the release time though.",

  "You could try to check if the problem is related to your Windows install, or a hardware issue (e.g. WiFi chip, antenna connection). \n\nOne relatively easy way would be to create a Linux bootable USB stick (e.g. Ubuntu).

Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",

  "If it's dropped like that again it will be Number 1, or very near it. Prices are a rollercoaster at this time of year and there's not much in it. There's a whisker between these and choosing what suits you best will leave you with a great laptop either way.",
  "The 9i looks like a nice machine especially with mini-LED, but the chassis is quite cheaply made, like the Pro 7. All plastic interior, including the hinge assembly.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo. I have a desktop that goes 165hz and that's more for gaming. sure it's smooth and all but eh not worth the batt life tradeoff).\n\nif you realllly wanna stretch the life, use MS edge as ur browser cuz that's the least battery draining browser out there.

Cannot for the life of me find a single review directly of this model. Or a related one with different specs. It's all Slims and 2-in-1s. \n\n\nWHY AM I LOOKING AT IT?\nNot for gaming, other than maybe a light cozy thing here or there. It's so I can do office type and browsing functions while I am on the move and potentially some light music production. \n\n\nThin and light would be good. Want to be able to carry it around without hassle. \n\n\nNeed a good battery life but not insane. 8 hours would be fine. Sales tech said this would get at least 10. I'd reduce the refresh rate to 60hz, I won't need 120 most of the time. Presumably that'll eek more time out. \n\n\nBest I can tell CPU should be pretty future proofed. Seems basically as good as it gets for this category. \n\n\nRAM is confirmed by sales tech as dual channel. Unfortunately there doesn't seem an option to do 64gb instead which would give me future proofing comfort. \n\nBut as far as I can tell the RAM (LPDDR5X-8533MT/s) is basically top of the line for portable laptops. \n\n\nWHAT AM I WORRIED ABOUT?\nMain thing keeping me from pulling the trigger is glossy screen as I like bright rooms and sitting outside haha but... seems like nearly all of then have that. I assume I can maybe put a screen film over it of some kind? \n\n\nSecond thing is overheat potential. Without reviews on this specific configuration, seems a risk the ultra 9 285H might get SPICY.

I liked it because it felt quite sturdy compared to the other displayed laptops, and very compact and lightweight.\nI have seen that there is a ryzen version 14\" , and also a 15\" version but only with Intel processors. Unfortunately the ram is soldered, so I don't know if I should go for 32Gb or 16 Gb are enough. \nThey cost approximately the same.  Which one is better? \nOr could I find something less expensive, in the 900-1200 range for example?\nProbably I need more the ram than a fast processor...? \nI think the modern integrated GPUs are better than the old dedicated ones so I don't think I need a dedicated gpu anymore..\n\nThanks\n",
  "For the Firefly, you can also look at reviews for HP Elitebook 845 G11.  Exactly the same machine, the ONLY difference is the BIOS.  Physically identical machines.\n\nI have a Firefly G10 A (7940HS) and an Elitebook 845 G11 (8840U) and I'm impressed with them.  I have the 2.5K 500-nit screen for both, and they're very powerful, INSANELY nice displays, with better than I would have expected battery life given the lcd.",

  "Choosing between a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro X 14 & Macbook Air M2 So I am shopping around for a laptop due to upcoming travels and I am torn between these two. The specs of each system are as follows:\n\n**Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro X 14**\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS CE / 3.3 GHz\n\nRAM: 32 GB (6400Mhz) LPDDR5 SDRAM\n\nHDD: 1 TB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 x4 - NVM Express (NVMe)\n\nDisplay: 14.5\" - IPS / 3072 x 1920 (3K) / 120 Hz /400 cd/m²\n\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 / 4 GB GDDR6 SDRAM (integrated GPU: AMD Radeon 680M)\n\n[Macbook Air M2](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/midnight-apple-m2-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-512gb)\n\nThe base version of the more expensive one:\n\n* Apple M2 chip with 8‑core CPU, 10‑core GPU, 16‑core Neural Engine\n* 8GB unified memory\n* 512GB SSD storage\n\nThe price points are roughly the same (buying in Sweden FYI) so it's all down to choosing the rig I want really.I certainly understand that I get \"more\" hardware with the Lenovo option but would like to hear what the better pick would be in your opinion and what you would consider before choosing.\n\nI never owned a laptop before, strictly a desktop guy and I am not looking to replace my desktop. I am happy if I can watch movies (Netflix & downloaded), manage 15+ tabs while browsing and play some lightweight games (like Hearthstone) while traveling, obviously I wouldn't mind playing some more demanding games but it's just a bonus. I don't do any video editing or anything like that. I would use it mostly for the things mentioned and work related tasks which is mostly trading via web browser.\n\nI can not upgrade anything on the Macbook Air version without getting outside of my budget. I would have looked at Macbook pro 14 m1 if I had US prices, alas I do not.\n\nI really like the design/look of the M2 and the fact that it has a long battery life. Since I also handle sensitive data I like that Mac inherently have less malwares going around and being developed to target them (even though that number is steadily increasing). It also feels like less of hassle when on the go, lighter, won't have to always bring a charger if I know I have a full charge when heading somewhere etc. My concern is that 8 gb of ram will be pushing it even for non heavy workload stuff (I heard conflicting things, as a PC user 8gb ram sounds like nothing in 2023 tbh) as well as being shoehorned into not ever doing anything demanding would the need arise (I really can't think of anything myself on the spot though).\n\nThe Lenovo clearly is a stronger machine (not in all, but most areas) and since I am a PC guy it's slightly more intuitive to use (I have a Macbook pro from 2015 and honestly, I never found it very confusing when I used it either). Another positive is that I can simply transfer a lot of the stuff I need from my desktop, mostly a convenience thing though. I have tried my best to find reliable reviews of the Lenovo as specced above but they are rare to find, I am concerned that the battery life would be a disappointment.\n\nI am a Android user so I won't be syncing anything with the Macbook if that is a consideration at all.\n\nAny advice or just ideas that could tip me in either directions would be great. Thanks a bunch!",

  "What did you end up with if you dont mind me asking? Are you happy with the decision?",
  "Thanks a bunch for your input. I think the price is due to Apple being significantly marked up in Sweden and there's no costco/amazon to bail us out either :< The Lenovo is a returned unit so it's marked down about 100 bucks or so which helps as well. I am def. leaning towards the Lenovo at this point.  \n\n\nEdit: I did some research, seems like the Lenovo is on sale for [1099 USD at costco](https://www.costco.com/lenovo-slim-7-pro-x-14.5%22-touchscreen-laptop---amd-ryzen-9-6900hs---geforce-rtx-3050---120hz-3072-x-1920-display---windows-11.product.100976621.html).

  "My review of Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro 5900HX, provides surprisingly good CPU performance for its slim factor. **Info:**\n&nbsp; \nThe performance is incredible for its thin form factor; read further to understand why.\nThis laptop was bought from a nordic retailer called Elgiganten\n\n\n[Retail store](https://www.elgiganten.se/product/datorer-tillbehor/barbar-dator/windows-laptops/266806/lenovo-yoga-slim-7-pro-14-barbar-dator-r9h161tb)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nHere's a pic of the laptop: \n[Pic here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/583295616470220811/856933484484362300/IMG_20210622_182621.jpg)\n \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\nThe price is pretty hefty, but this was the one with 8 cores in stock, so I went with this after waiting almost 1 year since the announcement of AMD Lenovo Yoga slim 7 Pro 2020 August.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI will be using laptops performance mode called extreme capacity and a third party software called AMD APU Tuning Utility (that allows the cpu to consume higher power in longer run) AATU for short which will be used as comparison reference to see if there's performance difference with and without AATU during benchmark.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/JamesCJ/amd-apu-tuning-utility\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinnebench 20: Extreme capacity mode:**\n\nMulti Score: 4520\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 64 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 45 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/DvmFls1.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinnebench 20: AATU:**\n\nMulti Score: 4891\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 72 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 60 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/Dw1aXon.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinebench 23: Extreme capacity mode:**\n\nSingle score: 1470\n\nMulti score: 11442\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 65 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 44 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/1GeKm4H.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Cinebench 23: AATU:**\n\nSingle score: 1478\n\nMulti score: 12547\n\nPeak Cpu Watt: 73 Watt\n\nSustain Cpu Watt: 60 Watt\n\n[Sensor showing power, cpu frequency](https://i.imgur.com/UFIqDe8.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Geekbench 5:**\n\nhttps://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/8527380\n\nEDIT: redid the geekbench putting the laptop under ideal condition this time\n\nhttps://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/8539588\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n**Aida64 Memory Benchmark:**\n\n[Benchmark](https://i.imgur.com/ZDONu1F.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**LatencyMon:**\n\n[Result](https://i.imgur.com/qXYhvga.png)\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Keyboard and trackpad:**\n\nThe key travel is a bit short to my liking, but I get used to it eventually. Lenovo comes with FNlock in escape key, which makes it easier to disable and enable. This is still a better keyboard to type than M1 macbook, though.\n\nTrackpad is a glass surface; while it's not that good compare to macbooks, it is still pretty damn close. Very smooth and enjoyable surface to touch. \nThe trackpad has a quiet click and doesn't rattle at all. The trackpad is firm in its stationary position.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Battery:**\n\n6 hours, with 60hz enabled and using multiple battery optimization. The screen itself chugs a lot of watt due to the resolution. Considering I'm primarily at the library with power plugged in, I don't find the low battery performance an issue. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nLenovo has built an excellent cooling solution wherewith restrictions temporarily removed, and it can sustain 60 watts in such a slim form factor that provides fantastic performance. Gaming laptops with 5900hx scored 4912, while my laptop with AATU reached 4872, which is incredibly impressive considering how thin the laptop is. \nSee hardware unboxed score of 5900hx [HERE](https://youtu.be/pdO4u87UCYI?t=229)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe build quality is up there with m1, and has a premium quality feel to it. The chassis doesn't budge when twisting the base. The screen hardly wobbles, although you kind of struggle to open the lid with 1 finger. The structure rigidity in this laptop case is excellent.\nCuriously, Lenovo decided to throttle performance, capping the max temp at around 85-89 degrees celsius. Doing this prevents the cpu from consuming more watts, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. \n\nAATU bypasses Lenovo throttle restriction and allows the cpu to get a bit more hotter while still staying within acceptable temperature according to AMD. This removal allowed us to consume higher power consumption which brings us better performance. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe fans are also pretty good at idle, where its very quiet and also very good when it ramps up to faster rpm speed. It's very subtle when the fans adjust the RPM speed. \nThe laptop fans stay very quiet even when watching twitch streams in 1080p streams, which is fantastic.\n\nThis laptop came with a lenovos premium warranty service where they offer live support and send technicians to your home to fix the laptop. I've waited close to 1 year for this laptop ever since lenovo announced the 4800H version of this laptop, and I'm delighted with this laptop.",

  "I have the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Aura 15ILL9 with IPS glossy touch screen. There is no matte screen version. Both IPS and OLED display models are covered by glass and reflective.",
  "Great job! 👍\nThank you.",
  "nice job! I'm also in hunt for intel lunar lake, and your research definitely helps! I hope HP Elitebooks and LG 16 Pro launch soon, I agree, both looks promising!",
  "An update on the Asus ExpertBook P5.\n\nAccording to this Czech review (which gives machine translations a hard time! 😄 )\nhttps://www.czechgamer.com/41586/asus-expertbook-p5-recenze.html\n\nAsus should release a version with Wi-Fi 7 and HDMI 2.2 later this year.",
  "Thanks for writing this down. What are the release dates of these devices?",
  "Just for future reference, the Surface Laptop 7 for business 15, 13.8 and 13 inch laptops have lunar lake cpu options.",
  "Quick question the power draw on the chips is limited to 37 , if i connect a external egpu will the power draw increase to match the gpu or is it calculated separately?",
  "Thanks for the hint, its now corrected.",
  "Thanks, I keep working on it. Overall happy to see more matte screen options than glossy. There were some more lenovos announced at ces 25. For me the new HP Elitebooks and LG 16 pro looks promising. The LG also allows 2 ssds.",
  "Thanks for the info and review link. I ordered a cheap version for 880 Eur and will have a good look at it and test if the screen and performance is good for photo editing using lightroom.",
  "You are welcome. Availability depends on your place in the world. Some are already available for order in Europe, like the Asus, Lenovos and Dells and others like the LGs will be released in Feb. To be sure check the manufacturers online shop, contact sales and let us know if you found it out :)",
  "I see you half corrected it haha\nThe IPS model is glossy and touch.",
  "👍",
  "Any idea about the Vivobook?",
  "Thanks",
  "I tested two p5 models a 226v and 258v.\n\n**Price / Performance:**  \nThe Price difference was 880 to 1300 Eur. The technical difference is 16 to 32 gb, 512gb to 1tb and a bit more cpu / gpu power which according to benchmarks results in only 7%-14% performance increase.\n\n**Screen wobbling:**  \nSome reviewers complained about the screen wobbling and the mouse pad clicking. The screen is a non issue in standard settings like using the laptop on a desk or when sitting in a room.\n\nHowever when typing while resting it on the lap a screen wobble is noticable and gets more intense when hitting the same key several times, for example the delete key.\n\n**Mousepad:**  \nThe glas mousepad is decent and very large with some special swipe on the side functions (loudness, brightness, etc..) by a asus tool .\n\n*Quality variations?* The first model had a unproblematic mouspad. The 2nd showed the follwing issue. When resting a finger on a the lower left or right clickable part of the pad and just raising the finger again, the pad bounces up a tiny bit. This is enough to produce an audible damp sound which I find irritating.\n\n**Keyboard:**  \nThe keyboard sounds a bit loud compared to thinkpad for example. It has not much damping. The press depth is decent and overall the typing feels reassuring and comfortable. The big keys which are not flat but slightly convex help with finger center alignment. I noticed not much flex, only when forcefully pressing on the keys, for me nothing to complain about when typing on the keyb. Minor problems: The small up and down keys are somehow easier to misstype and the delete button is not on the very edge.\n\n**Screen:**  \nThe screen is quite good with 144Mhz with a measured contrast ratio of 1:1800 after calibration with sufficient deep blacks:\n\nscreen report before calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX](https://ibb.co/WvGz9fX)\n\nscreen report after calibration\n\n[https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x](https://ibb.co/qrGCr8x)\n\nIn both laptops when looking at a black screen in a dim environment I noticed a several points of backlight bleeding at the bottom screen.\n\n**Speakers:**'  \nThe sound quality is decent and included mid levels and some bass. An wow, the volume can be turned up to a very high level!\n\n**Noise:**  \nThe only point that was initially a minus was the fan, which even in balanced energy and silent fan mode has a tendency to spin up and down when the CPU got anything to do, and the sharp spin up is very audible. I tried a lot of Fan Control tools and the \"[Asus Fan Control V5](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/asus_fan_control.html)\"  allows to set the fan to a constant 2000rpm. This becomes barely audible as background noise and could easily be the default for working with power supply in balanced mode. I still have to test the normal fan behaviour in energy saver mode. Using the Asus Fan Control .dll one could also develop a plugin to work with the much more customizable \"[Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/)\" open source software.\n\n**Fingerprints:**  \nFingerprints are a non issue since the overall body is silver.\n\n**Overall:**  \nAs described the lower priced model can be a good price/performance buy for people needing an enduring office laptop for overall media consumption.\n\nHowever when looking for a machine for media editing/creation I would reccommend the 32gb version. At that price point there are offers for similar performance products from manufacturers with higher quality standards.",
  "Thanks for the review, especially regarding the build quality and in particular the infamous \"weakness of the screen hinge\".\nIf I understand correctly, unless perhaps one does an extraordinary number of openings and closings, it is a non-issue.\nAnd once the screen is opened, it does not oscillate during use, i.e. typing.\nIs that right?\n\nAlso interesting is the information on the fan and how to work around it to make it less invasive.\n\nGive us updates when you have tried it even more.\nThanks again and good work, or rather .. have fun! 🙂",
  "Correct, there is no wobbling while typing on a flat surface and not shaking ground. Opening/closing wear ican only be determined over time. Any questions welcome.",
  "I mostly use my laptop on my lap lately (or rather, on a plank on my lap). Would you expect screen wobble to be an issue then? When typing or otherwise.",
  "Yes, I have a question.\nDoes the Asus ExpertBook P5 notebook support Wake-On-Lan in the BIOS?\n\nI ask because the notebook does not have an RJ-45 Ethernet port, but Asus provides an accessory (90XB05WN-MCA010) which is a USB dongle that also has a physical Ethernet connection and is declared to support Wake-On-Lan (WOL).\nI imagine that by connecting it at least to the USB-A port on the left side, which supplies power to external devices even when the PC is off, it should be able to turn on the computer.\n\nAlthough such a feature may seem futile for a notebook, since I will keep it as a second home PC (when not travelling) it can be very convenient to manage it, at home, from the main PC (with TeamViewer or similar software).\nI have already done it for my new GMKtec miniPC, which I use as a multimedia PC connected to a TV, and it is very convenient! 🙂\n\nThank you.",
  "I am currently typing this on my lap using the p5. While typing I look at the edges and notice a wobble. The screen does not stand still. It is especially noticable when hitting the delete key several times to delete more characters, then the wobble is more pronounced and could be irritating. When I just concentrate on the written text field it does not take the concentration too much. Hope it helps.",
  "I have the 258v here. In BIOS you can set Boot to UEDI: PXE IPv4 Network Card. Seems like you are lucky. I updated my P5 Review post.",
  "Ah thanks! I've bought one by now and have about the same experience. Maybe a bit less wobble even.",
  "Thanks! 🙂",
  "Which laptop for engineering studies? Hi, I'm a 3rd year chemical engineering student who needs to buy a new laptop. I need to be able to do programming in Python and Matlab, have multiple programs open: PYmol, Chrome/DuckDuckGo, Slack, Zotero, Word, Excel, Schrödinger Maestro etc. with very often multiple tabs (minimum 10 tabs) open in Chrome/DuckDuckGo due to literature research/general learning.\n\nI'm currently doing the 3rd year/bachelor thesis, which is a literature survey and my current laptop is seriously lagging, freezing etc. I also use the laptop for taking notes during lectures, which can be up to 8h per day. So a good battery is prioritised, as well as good enough power to compile code for programming courses and some maths courses where we use Python to solve some assignments. My budget is around 17000 SEK (Swedish krona), which is equivalent to 1767 USD.\n\nI'm currently pending between these models:\n\nYoga Slim 7i Gen 9 Aura edition (15\")\n\n15 027 SEK (lenovo website), Intel Ultra 7 258v, Integrated graphics, 32GB RAM LPDDR5X 8533MT/s, 15.3\" 2.8k IPS, touchscreen, HDR 400, 100% DCI-P3, 500 nits, 120Hz, Wifi 7, 70Wh battery.\n\nYoga 7i 2-in-1 Gen 9 14\"\n\n12 779 SEK (lenovo website), Intel Ultra 7 155H, Integrated graphics, 32GB RAM LPDDR5X 7467MT/s, 1TB SSD, 14\" 2.8k OLED, touchscreen, HDR 500, 100% DCI-P3, 400 nits, 120Hz, Wifi 6, 71Wh battery, Support for pen.\n\nYoga 9 2-in-1 14\" 14IMH9\n\n15 428 SEK (online store), Intel Ultra 7 155H, Integrated graphics, 32GB RAM LPDDR5X 7467MT/s, 1TB SSD, 14\" 2.8k WQXGA+ OLED, touchscreen, HDR 500, 100% DCI-P3, 400 nits, 120Hz, Wifi 6E, 75Wh battery, Support for pen.\n\nYoga Pro 7 AI 9 14.5\" 14ASP10\n\n15 490 SEK (online store), AMD Ryzen AI 9 365, Integrated graphics Radeon 880M, 32GB RAM LPDDR5X-8000, 1TB SSD, 14.5\" 3K OLED, touchscreen, HDR 600, 100% DCI-P3, 500 nits, 90Hz, Wifi 7, 84Wh battery.\n\nI've also had a look at a Thinkpad T14s Gen 4 (15 927 SEK) which is within budget, but I've read that it has bad battery time (57Wh)...\n\nWhat should I choose? I've been reading so many reviews and can't make up my mind. I like the 2-in-1 for taking notes and anotating articles. But I can continue with writing on paper or buy a cheap tablet for that purpose.\n\nMy priority is multitasking and compiling power with low fan noise as well as lasting a full day of studying/note taking during lectures. And minimum 14\" screen.\n\nThank you in advance! Really appreciate any advice\n\n(Crossposting here and on r/lenovo)",
  "Looking for durable, long lasting, quiet, bright laptop. Doesn't have to be really performant. Good day!\n\n**===== Mandatory requirements =====**\n\n**\\* A good battery life**. So CPU+GPU isn't needed, APU should be enough. For communication, light programming, light 3D design, light music production in Ableton with not many VSTs, and similar tasks. Kind of \"a machine for a student\", I guess?\n\n**\\* A good build quality**. Probably full metal then, right? I don't want to deal with broken hinges and similar problems. I'd like to be able to throw it into my backpack and don't worry too much about breaking it (to an adequate limit, of course).\n\n**\\* A silent cooling solution**. I shouldn't hear fans at all in any tasks except heavy ones: VS+VSC in debug + browser with many tabs opened + etc.; Ableton in high quality with many VSTs. If APU is relatively weak, so it's not able to deliver high performance, but it never makes the laptop noisy too -- alright, that's fine too. It doesn't have to be the latest tech.\n\n**\\* A bright, colorful screen**. I have a bad experience with other laptops (some were older models, some were newer) loosing maximum brightness relatively rapidly. So, as for a typical no-brain consumer, my first though is to battle this with the higher maximum brightness, say 500+ nits. What, in most, but not all, cases, automatically means an OLED screen. What lies along the \"colorful\" requirement. I don't have a huge fear of burn-in, I'm using a Steam Deck OLED since launch and an OLED smartphone for a few years; but feel free to warn me if you see a need, you're welcome. IPS is fine too, but OLED is preferable. But overall, if you think that the idea of battling the problem of \"loosing maximum brightness\" with higher maximum brightness is dumb -- I'm all ears.\n\n**===== Optional requirements =====**\n\n\\* Small pleasant touches that everyone wouldn't be against having in their own laptops. Like a **comfortable keyboard** (I type a lot, like really a lot, well, you see yourself), **precise touchpad** (this would be great, to be able to finally efficiently use laptop without mouse), **nice sounding speakers**, **many ports** (especially USB-C), **fingerprint reader**, **low weight**, **fast and stable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth**, etc. Would be nice to be able to charge it with USB-C port, not DC, but probably that's already included in modern laptops, and I'm just not aware. Okayish webcam (if it doesn't have a shutter -- no problem, I'll glue it with a tape myself 😄).\n\n\\* **I have nothing against ARM** APUs (M1, M1 Pro or Snapdragon; I don't see a need in M2 and newer, but we'll see), but I don't want to be a beta-tester and especially pay for it with my own money. I don't want to have VS/NPM/VST/.NET (not .NET Core) and other more common-usage (old software) compatibility problems. May this even cost me a small(!) downgrade in price, performance, or battery life -- reliability is more valuable to me. So **x64 is preferable**. But if you have pleasant personal experience with ARM -- I'll gladly listen to your arguments, why not.\n\n\\* If the laptop doesn't suck air from the bottom (or does, but not only from there), so I **can calmly throw it on any surface including a sofa or a pillow** \\-- that'd be nice.\n\n\\* **A touchscreen, or even a transformer**. Just a nice feature in some apps, say in Internet browsing, but I can live without it. By the way, I just caught myself thinking that, on practice, transformers may actually be even more durable because of those 360-degree-rotating hinges. I wonder if that's true 🤔\n\n\\* Size? Hm... 14\" is probably alright, but I lean more towards **15\", and even 16\"**. Less portable, sure, but it's worth it. I have a moderately performant device with a small screen already -- my smartphone.\n\n\\* I think **16 GB of RAM** should be enough for a device of such performance. As for the **SSD capacity -- the more -- the better**, depending on the price. To the point of also having a quiet but big (few TBs) HDD inside as well (but that may be too old-fashined and so rarely present nowadays, I assume 😄). **I have no problem with opening a laptop** and replacing the SSD, if I feel satisfied, and I'm going to keep it. Same about adding more RAM in the future (if it's not soldered, of course).\n\n\\* **Antiglare screen coating**. Not a matte, but a slightly matte -- antiglare. After using a Steam Deck OLED 1 TB with such a screen coating I've started loving it and would like to have it here too. If can be purchased separately -- no big deal, I can purchase and apply it myself. But, probably, then better the screen be glossy, right? To not end up being too matte, after applying the external antiglare coating.\n\n\\* **If x64 then AMD APU**. I have trust issues towards Intel. But if you see them pointless -- alrighty, I can try Intel too.\n\n\\* **60+ Hz screen, preferably 120 Hz**. Yes, even OS UI animations become more pleasant to look at.\n\n**===== What about examples I've found already in this subreddit and not only =====**\n\n\\* **Macbook Pro 16\" M1 Pro 16/512 or 16/1024**. Yes, ARM, compatibility problems (potential and confirmed). But if x64 alternatives are much worse and/or much pricier -- seems like I'll have to deal with those problems then, spend personal time on relearning a lot of things (never used Mac before).\n\n\\* **Macbook Air 15\" M2 16/512 or 16/1024**. Older 13\" is way too small. And this is at the same price as a Mac Pro higher, so I don't see a point in this one.\n\n\\* **Asus Zenbook 14 OLED UM3402YA**. A lot of complaints on the noise, but an interesting variant.\n\n\\* **Lenovo Yoga 6/7, Yoga Slim 6, Yoga Pro 7, Yoga Slim 7 Pro**. Brightness looks very low (300-400 nits), but except that -- this is the closest I've found. There are complaints about noise too, but, in comparison, there seem to be not as many of them (of complaints).\n\nThank you in advance and take care of yourself 👋 Ready to answer more aiming questions if needed. Will look for it in Europe. Budget: \\~€1000 for something interesting just not performant, \\~€2000 for something both interesting and performant (Mac Pro).\n\n**===== Updates =====**\n\n1. [Asus Zenbook 14 UM3402Y](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Zenbook-14-UM3402Y-laptop-review-New-Ryzen-7-7730U-name-old-Zen-3-performance.724864.0.html)\n\n*\"Asus advertises a peak brightness of 550 nits which we can confirm only when displaying HDR content. When running* [*this HDR test*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlAsAuBtmps)*, for example, we're able to record a maximum brightness of 542 nits on our test unit. Otherwise, maximum brightness is limited to just \\~340 nits when displaying SDR content which is still in line with most IPS-based subnotebooks.\"*\n\nWTF Asus? I've been relying on this characteristic so much. Welp, at least taking this into account will now add quite a bunch of other models into the pool of \"interesting\" ones. A lot of IPS screens, for sure.\n\n2. Apple MacBook Pro 16\"\n\nThe same, 1000+ brightness is awailable only in HDR, in SDR its \\~500. WTH?",
  "Yoga Pro 9i vs ThinkPad P16s Gen 2 (AMD) \nReally struggling to decide between the two machines. I am about to start studying product/industrial design at uni.

I came across the Yoga Pro 9i on the Lenovo outlet store and I was impressed by the specs. Having a Dgpu is tempting, even though it isn’t an accredited piece of kit by Dassault.

  "Help me decide on snapdragon vs core ultra laptops, please!  Hi guys.\n\nLooking for a new laptop in 1500-2k$ budget. \n\nUse cases with context: \n\nMy bread and butter comes from financial modelling for which I have to extensively use MS Excel. My excel models have ~30 sheets (at max 40-50) with up to 1000 rows filled at max. File size ranges up to 20-25mb.\n\n I have multiple models open at a time (3/4) along with extensive web browsing (20-25 tabs for chromes, sometimes even 50) for research, 5-10 pdf files opened for reading, and usual PowerPoint/Word stuff. \n\nI’m also an amateur photographer. Currently I own a MBA which I use for raw image editing using the default Apple Photos app. I intend to keep doing it on my windows device as well (but maybe shift to photoshop if default windows photo app is not good). \n\nI also want to have the liberty of running python/R scripts on my laptop for basic automation, data analysis from time to time. But nothing hard core. \n\nPriorities: \n\nAbsolutely need strong battery life along with good keyboard and trackpad. \n\nDisplay: Need at least 90hz display if not 120hz. Will prefer OLED displays. 2k resolution at least. Also, touch screen functionality will be preferred as I read a lot. \n\nLooking for a premium laptop which weighs less than 1.5kg and does not get overheated/loud on fans. I’m going to start my post graduation soon, so will prefer something lightweight. \n\nWhat are my options?\n\nAs per my research, 16gb ram is the minimum I should go for but 32gb ram will make it more future proof. Processors that I want: Core Ultra 7 155H, Snapdragon X Élite 78/80. Can’t really decide which way to go. Reviews on snapdragon are good with significant battery life. However, if I similar decent performance and battery life in core ultra laptops, I am good with them too. \n\nSnapdragon Laptops that I like: \n\n-> Lenovo Yoga Slim x (cannot find any fault in this one. Only that 32gb ram/512gb hdd isn’t available readily) \n\n-> MS Surface 7 (only negative seems the keyboard which looks like from a MacBook which I am not a fan of; also IPS screen)\n\n-> Galaxy Book Edge (negative reviews on keyboard/haptic, small battery) \n\nIntel laptops: \n\nI like Galaxy Book Pro 4 and Lenovo Yoga Pro 7. \n\n\nSorry for the long post, but will really appreciate inputs! Thanks in advance! \n\n\n\n",
  "Could look for something with a Ryzen 8845HS if you want both performance and battery life. There's also the AI 300 series CPUs AMD is releasing soon that might be worth looking at. Snapdragon CPUs often have compatibility issues, though there's nothing else at the moment that beats it in battery life for a Windows laptop. Intel Core Ultra tends to be more expensive than AMD options despite not being any better.\n\n\nMight also want a GPU for photo/video editing?",
  "My vote is with Ryzen. Core Ultra is too new for me to say with certainty how good battery life with performance is, but we know that Ryzen had been very good with battery and performance. Not to mention that depending on the Ryzen chip you choose, as long as it's modern, the iGPU on those things range from as good as a GT1030 to up to near GTX1060.",

Can you recommend me some laptops? Also, don’t think I need a dedicated graphics. It’s mostly photo editing and rarely video. Integrated graphics with 32gigs of ram ought to take care of that.

  "Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9 (2024) vs. HP Spectre 14 (2024) - Quick Comparison / Personal Impressions Hi all,\n\ndecided to post a quick review / comparison because I see a lot of people are facing similar buying decision.\n\nI own an Intel 11th generation Yoga 7 Slim 14 inch laptop and am looking for something new. The Yoga 7 is really creaky, has really bad speakers and - main reason I want to switch - only has 60hz. My main monitor and smartphone have 120hz and for me its the biggest innovation in years. I only have a laptop paired with an eGPU (RTX 3060) for desk setup, which works pretty well. I also thought it would be nice to have a 2-in-1 laptop for travelling, long haul flights etc.\n\nTo cut a long story short, after some research I decided on the HP Spectre 14 and the Yoga 9i 2-in-1, both with the latest Intel CPU. I pre-ordered both, so I received each of them with almost no reviews (and therefore no BIAS) out there.\n\nBoth versions had new Intel CPU 155H, 120hz (glossy) OLED screen. The Spectre came with 32GB, the Yoga 2-in-1 with 16GB. I wont talk much about performance because it doesnt really matter for me. There are now benchmarks out to compare.\n\nthe sad news first: I returned both laptop\n\n||HP Spectre 14|Yoga 9i 2-in-1 gen 9|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Design|+/- Personally, I didnt really like the design. Its way better / professional predecessor, but I still dont like the bulkiness and the cut corners of the spectre. Looks somehow awkward for me.|No great design as well. Its somehow looks like an unproportional burger. The top of the laptop is smaller then the bottom, in combination with its rounded and glossy edges it looks very akward. I chose colour \"cosmic blue\" which is okay, but a fingerprint magnet|\n|Build Quality|+ Very nice build quality, solid materials - not creaky at all. Very good hinge.|+ Very good, cant complain. Not creaky at all.|\n|Speakers|+ Very good speakers. Quality reduces drastically if you use in tablet mode, since the speakers actually play in the opposite direction|+ I think the best speakers I ever heard on a laptop, since its basically a huge rotating soundbar. This is great in tablet and tent mode as well, because the sound is still going in your direction|\n|Trackpad|+ Very nice haptic trackpad, definitely the best trackpad I ever used (on track with Macbook Pro)|-/+ Trackpad is only ok. Its not haptic, which is a dissapointment in their flagship|\n|Keyboard|+/- Keyboard was ok, but I don't understand the hype about it. I might be biased because I use Lenovo notebooks at work and home for years.|+ Keyboard is nice. But as said, Im biased / used to use Lenovo keyboards. I didnt like the additional row right to the \"return\" button|\n|Display|- Overall, a very nice OLED screen. But no matter.  The screen was absolutely terrible in terms of the 'screen door effect', I couldnt stand the graininess. I had read before that this could be a problem, but I was sure I could get used to it, but in reality it was an absolute nightmare.                   - Another annoying issue with the screen is that it is barely dimmable. I often use the laptop in bed/dark surroundings to stream something before going to sleep. The lowest dim level is still super bright. You have to use extra software to dim it.|- Nice OLED as well. Drastically less Screen door effect to a level I could live with. Also, its dimmable to very low brightnesss out of the box. Unfortunately the screen is super glossy. I mean, so glossy that in dark enviroment even the backlight of the keyboard is reflected.|\n|Other|- The \"Power On\" button is illuminated constantly, which is very annoying|-|\n\nAs I said, I have returned both laptops. I paid around €1700 for each and each had major faults that did not justify the price for me. The main reasons were the displays, I think glossy is just not for me. While I could live with the Yoga's display, I really missed the haptic touchpad and hated that it only came with 16GB.\n\nThe search continues. I think im done with looking for 2-in-1 and will get a tablet instead. Basically all I need is \"good/very good speakers, haptic t rackpad, non glossy and minimum 90hz screen\".  I have now pre-ordered the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4, which has a matte display and a haptic touchpad, unfortunately it is only 13.5\".  I also assume that the speakers will be bad. Will keep you posted :)\n\nHope it helped!",
  "I'm deciding between these 2. The 2-1 format would be useful for document reading etc, but the glossy screen issue is a deal breaker.   \n  \nCan anyone attest to the effectiveness of a matt screen protector to counter act the reflection?",
  "THANK YOU. Finally, someone who actually addresses the screen door effect in both flagship models. I work in the professional visual industry and need crystal clear displays, or at least with less graininess like e.g. Surfaces. I got both the Yoga 7i and Spectre for comparison and it drove me insane. I'm returning both and ordered the 9i now after reading your review - I found a model with 32GB RAM.\n\nOut of curiosity (and to better justify my money spent...) - Would you surmise you would've kept the Yoga 9i if only it had 32 Gigs of RAM?",
  "Do you know if either laptop supports legacy S3 sleep?",
  "lmfaooo please give an update fast. I was looking to buy either of these and now I don't want to.",
  "I am looking for a similar laptop. Thinkbook 13x is really tempting but 14“ would be even better. A bit outside of the box but the new DELL precision 5490 is on the game for me. 14“ Matte bright IPS touchscreen, nice CPUs, etc. You can choose it without dGPU.\nOr maybe upcoming new HP elitebook x360 if it comes with a H CPU.\nMaybe Huawei Matebook X 2024 is an option, no release date on Europe yet.",
  "u/peyta30 FYI, the 2-in-1 Gen 9 is now available with a Sensel haptic touchpad upgrade in the \"Build Your PC\" tool. Right now it's showing as a $60 upgrade, but once the 2-in-1 goes on sale, that discount will also apply to the haptic touchpad.\n\nFYI, the haptic touchpad in the Thinkbook 13x Gen 4 is not from Sensel.",
  "Hey so I've also been tied between the Lenova Yoga 9i pro and HP Spectre 360 16 inch. Both in 32 GB. The main difference is HP uses a OLED screen but 2800X1800 Res while Lenova Uses LED 3200X2000 Res. The lenovoa looked brighter. The other difference is the HP is 2 in 1 where as the Lenova has the Ultra 9 core processor and HP has the Ultra 7 core processor. So one is newer processor and higher resolution. The other is 2 in 1 and OLED screen oh and the HP has much better speakers. My issue now is that there is another Lenova yoga 9i option which is only $200 more which comes with a Mini LED screen, a higher graphics card 4060X, and 1200 Nit brightNess which is exponentially higher then HP and most other Laptops. The ONLY problem I've seen with that higher Lenova 9i option is that the battery is listed at 5 hours but people have claimed it barely lasts 3 hours. Sigh* If it didn't have the battery issue, I'd get the fully loaded yoga 9i in a heart beat so now I'm still tied between the original 9i or HP Spectre both in 16 inch 32 GB with same graphic card.",

  "What do y’all think of this laptop? This laptop just got released i think, it’s an updated model of the 2023 Yoga Pro 7 (or Slim 7 Pro if you’re in the US i think?) it’s got 32 gigs of lpddrx5 7467, rtx 4050, and the new core ultra 7 155h. It’s more expensive here due to taxes and all that. It’s more compact than a gaming laptop (which is important because i wanna study IT in university and is planning to keep the laptop for 4 years or even more). Has anyone had this laptop? And if you have, could you review it? iirc the last year’s model had some complaints of the screen not being large enough. \n\nThe second slide is the previous year’s model with a 16gb lpddrx5 5200, with an intel i7 13700h. It’s about $200-$250ish dollars cheaper. The question is, is 16gb ram enough for the next 4 years? (I do play some games on the side, but nothing triple A).\n",

  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",
  "Which laptop GPU is quieter? NVIDIA RTX 3050 or GTX 1650 I need to choose between a config with a GTX 1650 or RTX 3050. Same laptop (Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro), though the 1650 comes with a 4600H while the 3050 comes with a 4800H (pure overkill for me). I have zero interest in gaming and would gladly go with an internal GPU if that were available. Unfortunately that would mean waiting 6 weeks for Lenovo, instead of just 2 days.\n\nCurrent laptop (ASUS) has an RTX 2060 with a noisy GPU fan. Hardly ever goes quiet even when I manage to get the CPU fan to quiet down. That's the main reason I'm replacing it.\n\nI thought the more powerful 3050 GPU would be louder but online reviews seem to imply the 1650 is actually quite noisy. Would really appreciate thoughts from actual users. I just want a laptop that runs very quiet.\n\nPosted this again so I could add the option to view poll results.

  "I have a GTX 1650, and the fans only start up when I start gaming. And for a few minutes every now and then, but it’s quiet. If you don’t plan on heavy gaming, definitely go for the 1650.",
  "The gpu does not matter the laptops cooling capability. If you are not gaming the gpu isn’t being used to the point where the fans need to be on. Most of the time the fans might be on either side but they are dissipate heat from heat sinks that are shared between cpu and gpu. So if you cpu is hot you wil hear both fans. I own a laptop with a 1650 ti max q in a hp spectre. The fans spinning has no correlation with the gpu as the gpu isn’t on most of the time. A cpu will draw more power than a gpu at times resulting in the fan noise. \n\nIf I were you assuming you have the budget go for 3050 it is faster on a newer more efficient node and you have 8 cores which seems overkill rn but won’t be soon.",

  "Theoretically you are absolutely right. Unfortunately my experience with my ASUS ROG Strix with the RTX 2060 GPU has been different.\n\nThe GPU fan comes on all the time. Maybe it's damaged. I've tried absolutely everything. \n\nTried using ASUS laptop management software. Set it to Silent mode. Reduced the CPU processing power in the Power Settings. Even disabled the actual GPU itself. The best I've been able to do is turn off the CPU fan but the GPU fan is relentless. Even MSI Afterburner (the darling of the Internet) doesn't help. So perhaps you understand my worry here.",

  "What I can suggest you try to trouble shoot the asus to rule the gpu out is disable it in the bios and see if the occurrence happens if it still does then it might be a thermal sensor triggering the fan not related to either the cpu or gpu.

  "The RTX version will provide a better experience. The 1650 will also run things, but not as smoothly and with not as good graphics. Tbh, the only reason I would tell you to look for a different laptop is the screen. 200 nit LCD is not too good. It doesn’t have HDR either.",

  "So, the laptop is pretty awesome. I’ve had it all week and have found that it’s gotten better with use. The first day I almost took it back because the touchpad was so bad and their own Lenovo Vantage application kept crashing. Once all the updates took effect and the laptop had time to settle in, there were no more issues. \n\nThe WiFi is incredibly fast, and I’ve never experienced a faster initial connection and any device ever, including iPads and iPhones and MacBooks. Instantaneous to the router as soon as your password is in. \n\nThe main feature of the snapdragon version was supposed to be the “snappiness” and the battery life. But this thing has been nothing but snappy—everything happens instantaneously. I’ve never had a machine this responsive. It’s like having your car switch gears without ever feeling the change in the transmission, just unbelievably smooth. That being said, nothing will be the battery life on a Mac, so there’s no real reason to compare. Their ARM efficiency is so vastly ahead of the competition that it’s not even a fair comparison. They’re strange machines to me (MacBooks) in that their computing power is unrivaled, but their interface makes them look like toys for kids rather than serious machines, which I suppose they are but just never really feel that way. My use case on the daily is for Windows-based computing, so that’s why I returned the m3 air I bought earlier this year (that and their new keyboard is awful, paper thin and the keys so closely placed I couldn’t type properly. I was going to lose my mind). Was able to get through work days with no battery life issues, ended up around 40% every day with about 5-6 hours of use, so definitely use dependent. I am not sure if the battery is compromised by having to run a virtual desktop all day? I’m sure someone here can better attest to that. \n\nThe screen is glorious—I’ve never been a fan of OLED for a laptop so that’s actually a plus for me. I almost went and bought a refurbished Lenovo for the mini LED screen it featured, but it was much bigger and heavier than this laptop. \n\nThe portability is insane; the engineering to pack a 15.3” screen while using essentially the body of a 14” laptop is mind boggling. I was reliant on my 2018 intel MacBook Air (still just perfect except for the giant bezels and dwindling battery life) until the aura, and, when you place the 13.3” air over the aura there’s only minimal excess laptop all around. Just an exceedingly slim experience. \n\nI wish the materials were just a tad more premium, with the feeling of the sleek aluminum from the Air still more solid in the hand. Being able to open the laptop with one hand would have been nice, but life goes on. \n\nThe x1carbon aura will probably be the perfect machine w the haptic pad and the choice of oled or IPS based on your preference, so if you’re willing to wait and spend double the cash for the same specs and a one pound lighter laptop then I would do so. I didn’t think it was worth all the extra cash for the upgraded materials, essentially doubling the cost. The HD is fast enough, and for my purposes shelling out extra for a 2280 disk would have made no discernible difference in daily use. \n\nAll in all, stunning and I’m glad I waited for this instead of the yoga 9i meteor lake which was what I was considering previously. \n\n32g \n1 tb \nWindows 11 pro\nAt no additional cost on Lenovos website I was able to also add Office Pro and Acrobat 2020, so that’s an extra $500 or so of software. Good deal right now\n\nArrow Lake and Panther Lake look promising. The future is bright for intel, and the spinoff on their design business is going to be one to invest in for sure.",

  "It's made out of aluminum, but when i played around with the yoga 9i and the slim 7x they just felt like better quality. The one thing I didn't mention was the keyboard--it's phenomenal. The main reason I didn't consider the HP or the ASUS, the two main competing lunar lake laptops that look really phenomenal, was that I really disliked their keyboards. This is the best typing experience I may have ever had on a laptop. It's not that this computer isn't well built--it certainly is, it has the military grade durability and so on, but it just doesn't have a \"pro\" look or feel. You can tell it's consumer-grade material. It's like comparing a commercial kitchen product to a consumer grade line--they may be moth stainless steel but there's just a difference in the quality that's probably related objectively in some way, but it's difficult for me to describe or quantify. Please note this is a really nitpicky thing to say--this is the best laptop I've ever owned, and it's not close. I was between this and a macbook pro14\", but I'm super satisfied and felt like it was a great deal to upgrade the RAM to 32 and the 1 tb HD w the free office pro/acrobat std. Really good deal and very high quality with an excellent processor. The silence and coolness of the laptop are really evident as well. I played COD MWIII just to see how it ran compared to my prior Microsoft Surface Book 2 from 2017 which had 16 gb ram and a NVDA 3050 card, and it's not even close how smooth and well this computer handled it. \n\n  \nWould highly recommend if the OLED was an issue for you, because most manufacturers seem to be going OLED route, so if you are happy w the Snapdragon chip and there's no compatibility issues, the only real competitor here would be the Surface laptop, which would cost you another 1500 to have all of the above specs/software. I have been waiting to see what was next for my laptop world since it's been so long, I had to learn a lot about the chip game to understand what I was waiting for. I think the only thing I'd say is if you're not in a hurry, see how these compare to Strix point laptops. If you're like me and have more basic needs that aren't super tech dependent, this is an excellent daily driver. Of course if you have a specialized need you're probably not in this forum anyhow. \n\n\n\nFor the money, you can't get a better laptop. \n\n  \nHope that helps!",

  "I haven't seen any malware that attacks android phones and modify the webpage content / hosts file to redirect you to a phishing page. Looks like a real website, but the pricing is definitely a glitch, which they would either honor it as another redditor mentioned, or cancel the order if you place it. Yet - the company has all rights to cancel an order at anytime and refund you the money. \n\n  \nI'd go for it and see what happens if I were you, no harm in losing a rupee. Virtual cards are best, I remember SBI had this feature at least 10 years ago but not sure now. Proceed with due diligence.",

I only learned this after a month of waiting for it to arrive and it being in the ready to ship stage, still showing that they had stock. When the error was discovered they offered to cancel my order and find a machine that “fit” my needs at whatever price they were selling it at. No, I wanted a machine with the closest specifications at the price that I ordered and paid for the first one that you said you had in stock. They didn’t budge at all. I ordered a machine at $250, the next one that had the closest specifications was $750. The original price of the machine I ordered was $950.

If a product is in stock and is purchased, the order is automatically added to the queue and dropped in the next wave of orders for the warehouse workers to pick and ship it. \n\nMany times the packlist/order receipt will show the total price of the order, but nobody really pays attention and even if a warehouse grunt sees it, they will assume nothing and still send it out. No managers or financial workers will see the order until well after it is shipped and delivered in most cases",
  "I have worked at a popular grocery store for over a decade. In the U.S. if a store has a price sign in front of a product that indicates an incorrect price, we have to honor it. Otherwise it’s called bait and switch. I have no idea how this is handled online or internationally however.",
  "They don’t. Law undergraduate here. This falls under contract law. A website listing or product is considered as an **invitation to treat**, and not an **offer**. To define an offer, I will quote it from the case of Preston Corpn Sdn Bhd v Edward Leong: An offer is an intimation of willingness by an offeror to enter into a legally binding contract. Its terms either expressly or impliedly must **indicate** that it is to **become binding on the offeror** (buyer) assoon as it has been **accepted by the offeree** (seller).\n\nEven if the customer were to send an offer (by checking out), a **binding contract** is not yet formed because Lenovo has yet to accept that offer and they can choose to back out as there is no **legally enforceable agreement** yet. (A confirmation email is also not signifying of acceptance of order!)\n\nA similar example to this would be Chwee Kin Keong v Digiland Mall Pte Ltd. TLDR is that an employee keyed in a pricing for a product at $66 instead of $3,854 (MSRP) and the company obviously didn’t want to fulfil orders that were made and got taken to court. Court ruled in the company’s favour.\n\nIn consumer court, courts do consistently rule in favour of the seller during obvious pricing mistakes like a $1 phone etc. because they take the view of a **reasonable person in consideration and apply the objectivity test**. \n\nFor example, in this case, the court said:\n“I find ... that the plaintiffs, given each of their backgrounds, would in any event, each have separately realised and appreciated, before placing their purchase orders,that a manifest mistake had occurred – even if no communications on the error had taken place between them. Further, the character of the mistake was such that **any reasonable person** similarly circumstanced as each of the plaintiffs would have had every reason to believe that a manifest error had occurred.” . \n\nOtherwise, the court would also simply treat it as a **clerical or unilateral mistake** and not punish the seller. Similarly in this case, Lenovo would win.\n\nIf there’s any Law graduates reading this and want to improve on my stand, please do! I’m still studying and open to improvement",
  "Nope where it's clearly a mistake and you know it, they don't need to honour it",
  "They are not and three seconds of googling will support that. Just because you once managed to slip one through doesn’t mean that’s the law.\n\nImagine a computer store mislabelling a €4000 laptop at €1 and a large amount of units are ordered overnight while nobody’s at work. Your argument is that EU law now effectively forces this company into bankruptcy by being required to honor these sales that were clearly made exploiting an error in pricing?",
  "No....",
  "Depends on the Ts and Cs",
  "Yeah.... depends on if that's enforceable to a website in another country.... Much like the GDPR fines the EU charges.... a US website isn't subject to that....  even if they decide to keep data on you... because they're not breaking THEIR laws.",

  "True, but I was just giving an example to explain. However, if we look at it in layman terms, the universal legal principle will be the same. You simply cannot reasonably expect to enforce a contract based on a price that is **obviously an error**. So in any jurisdiction, I’m highly confident that Lenovo would win should this be taken to court. \n\nIf you search up similar topics, you will find that across common law (Singapore, UK, US) and civil law (France, Germany, EU), the courts follow the same reasoning:\n1.\tObvious pricing errors = no binding contract.\n2.\tBuyers cannot exploit a mistake they recognize.\n3.\tThe worst that happens to the retailer is refunding the money.\n\nHowever, if we are referring to say, a $599 MSRP laptop being listed erroneously at $499, the court may order the seller to honor some of the orders, which has happened in many jurisdictions before, since borderline errors (e.g., 10–25% off normal price) can be interpreted as a discount/promotion and would lead a reasonable person to believe that there is no mistake in pricing.\n\nIn this case though, it’s a laptop for $1. So it’s pretty obvious and no court would side with the buyer.",
  "Incorrect.\nTL;DR Lenovo (and most other companies) explicitly states that a confirmation email does **NOT** signify acceptance of the order. **No acceptance = No contract.** (This clause is commonplace for every business) Consumer will lose if he tries to go to court, even if he has the best lawyer. Below, I will cite Lenovo.\n\n**Full explanation:**\n\nA confirmation email, if you dig deep into any businesses’s Terms and Conditions (the thing that everyone ignores), has built in protective clauses in their Terms of Sale, and they’re not obliged to provide the consumer with any goods or service with a confirmation email alone. **Confirmation email ≠ acceptance.** A confirmation email only signifies that they have **received** the order.\n\nHere, I will specifically cite for this case, Lenovo. Under their T&Cs, it clearly states that **a confirmation of Lenovo receiving and/or processing your order does not constitute acceptance of the order.** (1.2)\n\nSource: https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/legal/new-products-and-warranty-services/?srsltid=AfmBOop9YcXqtlgbWWSEtLd4WCy7paTFtCMABKIs8xZmfYyPvIBRyTbc&ut\n\nIt also states under 1.1 that:\n\n1.1) **No contract** for the purchase of Products or Services will be formed until Lenovo accepts your Order by **one of the following**:\n\n**(a)** shipping the hardware Product and sending you a shipment confirmation email; or\n\n**(b)** making the software Product available to you; or\n\n**(c)** providing the Service to you.\n\nTherefore, that confirmation email is **not a binding acceptance** and is more of an acknowledgment that they’ve received your order and are processing it. Until shipping occurs (or software is delivered, etc.), Lenovo **reserves the right** to cancel or adjust your order **even if** you’ve already received a confirmation email or any other form of confirmation.\n\nI personally think that TV shows these days make the law seem very shallow to the average person, like; “Little guy sues company and wins!”. \n\nThe reality is, that every business has multiple built in protective and failsafe clauses layered into their contracts etc. to make sure that real consumers **will never win against them** in court. I feel like the average person should read more into the T&Cs so they know what they’re getting themselves into, but we don’t, so companies take advantage of that; and that is why we have lawyers :)",

  "No coil whine and I don't believe this one has liquid metal, so no leakage issues there. Overall, it's been great. The build quality is pretty solid, but it's not as good as the MacBook or the Razer Blade I had. However, Razer got rid of the glass on their displays, which has led to them feeling lower quality to me, and lesser in comparison to the Macs that still use glass. The bottom panel is a cheap plastic one which again, feels lesser in quality vs those other two, but it's not something I notice in my regular usage because it's either docked or on a desk and then going in and out of a bag. \n\nIt has a minor issue on the trackpad, but it's still very usable, just annoying. Since I rarely use the trackpad and use external M&K when at home, or a mouse and the built-in keyboard while traveling, it's not a big deal. \n\nPerformance-wise, I'm still able to max out all of my games on absolutely Ultra settings including Path Tracing on Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2 with good frame rates on my external 34\" Ultrawide. When playing on the 2560x1600 internal display, performance is obviously even better. \n\nI bought this because I needed the absolute most power possible in the lightest, most portable package possible. I traveled for work weekly for the past few years, and I travel regularly, so having this has been a godsend. I remember playing Warzone in LaGuardia at one of the bars when my flight got delayed and blowing off steam was great. I took this to QuakeCon for 3 years now, and the ability to pack more power than my desktop into something that fits in my backpack is amazing.  \n\nComing from a Mac, probably your biggest hurdle is going to be battery life, but the latest CPUs are supposedly much better in that regard (though we hear that every generation so YMMV).",

  "I really like it. I specifically wanted the Tandem OLED and it's great for watching HDR content after calibration. And unlike the Yoga Pro 9i which has 275H, the Yoga 7 has a 17watt low-power CPU that gives it much longer battery life. I get 8-9 hours browing multiple tabs. \n\nMy only gripe is 4 key rollover across Lenovo yoga series. 120Hz and Intel ARC grapgics are all great for playing high FPS games, except the keyboard doesn't register multiple presses very well.",

  "Old ones okay maybe if decently priced. Problem are new ones, being super overpriced while offering very little. An example : A mid range T14 G5 with a core ultra 5 125U, 60hz 1200p sRGB IPS display, 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage, which for those two are getting below today's standard, is priced at 1200€. Those are specs you'd find on a 600-700€ laptop, not a 1200€ laptop. At 1000€ you can already get something well built with a Ryzen 7 8th gen, 32gb of ram and 1tb of storage (Asus Zenbook, HP Elitebook, etc). In this case that laptop OP showed was a pretty fine deal, but if you took a Thinkpad for the same price you'd have an E14 Gen 6 with even worse specs. They stay good, don't get me wrong : but at any price range there's pretty much always a better deal.",

  "Keyboard's alright. As for the burn in, I think it'll be fine, especially if you don't run max brightness (the screen is very bright, even half brightness is much brighter than most laptop screens) and auto hide taskbar. Bonus point if you use a OLED friendly theme (iirc the O365 suite has one where the background and ui is pure black). Those are only preventive measures and not really 100% necessary unless you're really scared.",
  "Yeah, I think it’ll perfectly suit your use. You can even play games on it like Fortnite at native res with amd adrenaline’s capper on 75 at 70 fps, Minecraft at 100 fps, the 780M is great.",
  "The AI 350 is slightly better, but the 256v does it all at 17W. Normally the Intel one should have better battery life. Will very easily handle what you said, even some more intensive tasks like gaming.",
  "Hi dear, how about the fan noise? Do you often hear them?",
  "Strangely it's hard to find an 8845hs or 8840u ddr5, good battery life + screen laptop here in India without overpaying a lot. \nBut I found an almost equally good Ryzen 7 AI 350 laptop with 860M igpu, 32 GB ddr5 5600 MT, 60wh fast charge. I think that'll be almost equally good as your laptop?",
  "so the intel would be the better choice ? between it doesn't have the multi threading capabilities, that's why i hesitate",
  "The ai 7 350 has a weaker iGPU but is normally slightly better than the 8845hs, would be close or even better since it also consumes less.",

  "Lenovo Yoga 7i Gen10, 14-inch laptop (2025) review **UK-based Laptop Review**\n\n**1. Title:**  \nLenovo Yoga 7i Gen 10 (2025) Review: power and portability\n\n**2. Introduction:**\n\nThis is a review for the 2025 yoga 7i gen 10 model from Lenovo with intel core ultra 7 258v and 14 inch screen. I bought the configuration from the UK Lenovo website with 32GB RAM, 1TB SDD, 2.8k OLED 120Hz screen, Luna Grey colour and optioned the fingerprint scanner for an additional £10, paying £1090 in total (including the 10% VIP discount for healthcare workers). This is a premium grade 2-in-1 consumer laptop with a solid build, great for anyone who needs a portable and powerful device.\n\nI haven’t seen many user reviews for this particular generation of laptop so thought it would be useful for anyone considering it.\n\n**3. Design and Build Quality:**\n\nThe chassis all metal, which gives it a very solid feel. The build quality is great, there’s very little flex in the case or the keyboard. The body does not pick up fingerprints. At 1.4kg, it’s not the lightest laptop but it’s still very portable. It fits my 13 inch laptop sleeve. I don’t have much use for the tablet mode as I find it too cumbersome when compared with holding an actual tablet. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and the trackpad is smooth and accurate. I appreciate the double height enter key. Coming from the LG gram 16, this is a much better typing and trackpad experience.\n\nPort selection is good. There are 2 USB-C ports, one on either side, with one USB-A, one full-sized HDMI, a microSD card slot and a headphone jack. The power key is on the right side which I’ve mis-pressed a couple of times so I’ve disabled it in the settings.\n\nThe display is a 14-inch glossy OLED touchscreen with 2.8K resolution (2880 x 1800), 500 nits brightness (1100 nits HDR Peak). I find the screen bright and vibrant. Watching video in a dimmed room is fantastic with zero light bleed. Reflections and fingerprints can be an issue, especially when viewing dark things on the screen and there is bright ambient. However it is still useable under these conditions.\n\nThe hinges are solid, with little screen wobble when typing but it does require two hands to open the lid. The look and feel of the laptop is very nice with smooth rounded outer edges.\n\n**4. Performance and heat:**\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 258v is perfectly capable of handling my usual tasks of multiple Chrome/ Firefox tabs, connecting to my remote desktop for work and steaming video content.  I have tried some gaming and the experience with casual  games has been very good. Fortnite runs at 120FPS. Cities Skylines runs great. I’ve tried playing Watchdogs and although it could play it, the framerates were only around 40fps and the processor got quite hot with the fans getting noisy.\n\nThe keyboard and palm rest areas are always cool. The area under the screen gets warm under load but the hot air is blown out through the vents on the back, away from the user which is a good design.\n\n**5. Audio and Webcam:**\n\nThe speakers are fine, they are up firing from the sides of the keyboard and they are rated for Dolby Atmos. I can clearly hear the 3D effects when watching YouTube or Netflix. There isn't much bass but it is acceptable for a thin and light laptop.\n\nThe 5M IR camera is decent for video conferencing. There is a privacy shutter switch just above the camera. Windows Hello usually takes just a few seconds to log me in. I have found the fingerprint scanner works faster, especially when the lighting conditions are not ideal for Windows Hello.\n\n**6. Battery Life:**\n\nThe 70WHr battery lasts all day for me when web browsing/ streaming videos. I use a 100W Ugreen 4-port USB C charger to charge all my devices and the laptop fully charges within a couple of hours.  \n\n**7. Software and User Experience:**\n\nThe OS is Windows 11 Home 64 and comes with some minor bloatware including McAffee Antivirus, Lenovo support/ vantage/ AI shenanigans. The Lenovo Vantage software has some useful features including dimming various parts of the screen to save battery – I only use the taskbar dimming though as I find the background dimming too distracting. It also enables you to switch the laptop on just by lifting the lid, which means the much maligned side power switch is hardly ever used. There have been reports of this power button breaking easily on other models and thus bricking the device.\n\n**8. Price and Value:**\n\nThe base model costs £1000 (£900 for students or those that qualify for VIP member) and comes with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and a14inch WUXGA OLED screen (1920x1200, 400nits, 60Hz). I was happy to pay the \\~£200 premium for the better spec’d screen with double the RAM and SSD. Mine came with a 65W USB-C charger and a stylus pen which magnetically attaches to the lid.\n\n**9. Pros and Cons:**\n\n* **Pros:** Screen, performance, battery life, keyboard\n* **Cons:** Screen reflections, power key positioning.\n\n**10. Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a well-built laptop where the pros far out-weigh the cons. The OLED screen is fantastic and it has been a pleasure watching content in a darkened room. It is very easy to travel with, having all-day battery life and a thin and light form factor.\n\n**Final Rating:** 9/10",
  "Really nice post.\n\nIm looking into this as pretty much the only option as the price is really good compared to others.\n\nIm sceptical about the hinges, but you say they are fine. And also if the performance is okay, if i could spec it id go higher but there arent really any options. \n\nThe next thing is vivobook which goes about 50% more with worse screen",
  "How about the weight, does it feel heavy...do you think it's worth the penny and do you think it's a good investment until 2028 atleast?",
  "Im setting up my 16 inch model right now and the fans are running on low constantly and high pitch too, did yours do the same?",
  "Hey, I am curious how did you opt for the fingerprint scanner. I can't find it in the configurations. Thanks.",
  "Potentially stupid question...\n\nI'm comparing different Lenovo Yoga 7s on their website,  and nowhere does it say which generation is which... How do you guys know this information?\n\nThere's so many reviews out there 😵‍💫",
  "I'm thinking of getting this laptop but I'm wondering about the CPU performance for things like python and matlab number crunching(data/optimization/small simulations etc)\n\nJust curious what kind of work do you do on it and is the CPU fast enough for that? I'm still not sure whether the lesser multicore compared to a 200H arrow lake is a problem or if I'm overthinking about the 258V",
  "hello, here some questions:\n1. what version of hdmi port does it have?\n2. What components could you upgrade? ssd, battery, keyboard?",

  "Hi OP, I read a few other reddit posts regarding poor battery life on this particular screen option (2.8K) compared to alot of the youtube reviews (which seems to be based on the 1200 screen option). When you say all day do you mean \\~7 hours? Are you leaving your screen on 120Hz or reducing it to 60Hz.",
  "Hi, I’ve used a Lenovo Yoga 7 AMD from a few generations back with the Ryzen 6800U for the past 3 years and have had no issues with the hinges for what it’s worth!",
  "Thanks. Only time will tell regarding the hinges but they look and feel sturdy to me and these double hinge designs should in theory spread the force out across the 4 contact points on each hinge, reducing the stress at any one point. I'll update if I have any problems with the hinges",
  "It doesn't feel heavy but it's not feather-light like the LG gram. The LG gram can be lifted from a corner with one hand easily whereas I'd struggle to do this with the Yoga 7i. The Yoga 7i   feels more substantial, more premium. However it is still easy to carry around in a back pack.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase so far - it does everything I need and I feel it is good value for what you get compared to an equivalent from HP or Apple. As long as I keep the battery in good condition and the hinges don't break, I'm sure it'll last a good 3-5 years. \n\nIf I didn't play PC games, I would have strongly considered a macbook air 13\".",
  "The 14 inch model doesn't have this problem at all. It's mostly silent. Your 16 inch model should have even better thermal handling given the extra space. The constant fans might be due to all the updates being installed, see how it goes",

The UK lenovo website states which gen it is,  the i is for Intel, they usually have AMD in brackets for AMD models. X means snapdragon. I think the gen 10s are sometimes called Aura Edition too",
  "1. The HDMI port is a standard sized 1.4b\n\n2. The SSD can be upgraded via the M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe SSD slot but that's about it. The RAM is soldered on the model I got.",
  "There is a black border around the screen but the glass extends over it. The border houses the web cam",
  "I turned off the side power button and activated the open screen to switch on option which works really well. It means I never accidentally mis-press the power button and it should last a lot longer",
  " battery life has been fine for me, I've kept it at 120Hz and only charge up to 80%. Off power, I've been using it for 5 hours now, browsing/ streaming at 50% screen brightness and there's still 45% remaining, so that's just 35% battery use after 5 hours of light usage. I would expect at least 12 hours from a fully charged battery",
  "So pc games work on this one? How is the performance, which games did you try out and does it heat up?",
  "Do you still see that option? Cause I don't see it when I want to configure it",
  "Interesting... Yea the Canadian site doesn't mention generation. We have all those versions though.",
  "yea the cpu and size are all included in the full model name, but aura edition stands for the optimized intel partnerships versions that have slightly better battery life and perfs",
  "Is it possible to replace the keyboard?",
  "Awesome. Thank you ",
  "[removed]",
  "Whats the thought behind charging to 80% - does this extend overall battery life long-term?",
  "Yes, you can play PC games. Fortnite runs at 100-120FPS on the native screen resolution. Cities Skylines plays well.  I wouldn't expect to be able to run the latest AAA 3D intensive games well, but it can run most of them on low settings but I wouldn't recommend it for that as the fan noise gets quite loud if pushed too hard.",
  "Yes, it's still there as an option on the Lenovo UK website for the Lenovo Yoga 7i",
  "You would have to replace the entire assembly including touchpad",
  "I've used the laptop for a few months now and on the rare occasion that I do need to use the side power button (maybe twice so far), it's worked as it should. I think if the usage of the power button is so low, it should easily last the entire life of the laptop",

Could i get something better for the same price or less or a bit more expensive? please let me know ",
  "Yoga Pros are solid ultrabooks, but whether it’s good for you depends on the exact specs of the laptop and what you are studying/doing/gaming/working on.\n\nwhat’s your field of study at uni? some degrees will require specific hardware, such as a graphics card, and not all of the Yoga Pro models have discrete GPUs which brings up the earlier question about specs.",
  "It's a bit heavy for my tastes at over 3.5 lbs, but it seems like a decently compact powerhouse.\n\nAnother system to consider is the Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition. It's an Intel Lunar Lake machine, about 2.75 lbs, Arc graphics, up to 32 GB of RAM. It's cheaper, and would have a better battery life, but the Arc graphics are slower than the 3050.",
  "mechanical engineering. i do plan to get a desktop with a better gpu in the future but the yoga pro 7 has a ryzen 7 8845hs and 3050",
  "i have been looking at that but it’s pretty much out of stock everywhere i’ve looked. i would get the 4060 of the pro 7 but i can’t find it either",
  "that configuration should be enough for your degree. it’s very unlikely you’ll need more than the 3050 for your undergrad.",
  "Can't help you there. It was in stock on Lenovo.com, but that's pricey. I got mine new on ebay with the full manufacturer warranty for $799 (256V model)",

  "well, it’s objectively an underpowered and limited discrete card. the hate is warranted, especially for the desktop variants which are extremely poor performance for the price you pay. **it’s a terrible option if your goal is to play video games**. \n\nits use case is different for laptops and students. for what the 3050 lacks in performance, it makes up for in being a very efficient card that draws very little power. in a laptop, you don’t necessarily want a powerful, power-hungry card that heats up like crazy and drains the battery life in 5 seconds. all laptop card variants are much worse than their desktop counterparts, anyways.\n\nfor you specifically, having a discrete GPU at all is largely beneficial for CAD software and other modeling software. sometimes, these softwares require a discrete GPU to even function properly. \n\na laptop is where a 3050 probably shines brightest. for more context, the 3050 is one of the few relatively modern cards that has a model without a power cable. there’s a low-profile desktop GPU 3050 that draws a max of only 50W and is powered solely through the PCIe connector. cool stuff.",

  "slight update. i just found an omen 14 with an ultra 7 155h and a 4060 for $1300 and i might be going with that because it literally better in every way?",
  "it is a much higher performing laptop for sure in every aspect. like I said, the Yoga Pro is enough for your degree, but the Omen 14 is a gaming laptop and you could legitimately use it to game in many modern titles as well.",
  "okay thanks for the clarification. i might as well get the omen then but ive heard the battery is terrible",
  "it’s a gaming laptop with a powerful CPU. the H model Intel Ultra chips have more cores and faster clock speeds which draws significantly more power. once again, the Yoga Pro is better for battery life and it’s more than enough for your studies, but the Omen is a powerful gaming laptop. its first and foremost built for gaming, which you will never do on battery anyways.",
  "Laptop comparison: Zenbook14 (amd) vs Yoga slim 7 intel vs Yoga slim 7 gen 10(amd) I just graduated and am planning on buying my second laptop. I am considering either a ZenBook from Asus or Yoga from Lenovo.

I would prefer a 16GB RAM and 1TB storage. 512GB is also fine if other features are good. looking for a laptop with OLED Screen.\n\nI have 3 options that I really like:\n\n**1.

I love everything about this laptop - the color, build, display quality. The amd version of this was released in India a few days ago. It has Ryzen AI 5 340 Processor which i know is quite good. Only downside is its 1TB Version is not yet available in India and I am not sure if it will be released any time soon too. I will have to pay extra for warranty too.\n\n**2. Yoga Slim 7 Gen 10 - AMD AI : 81,275 Rs**  \n[Lenovo Yoga slim 7 Gen 10](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-s-series/lenovo-yoga-slim-7-gen-10-14-inch-amd/83jycto1wwin1)\n\nThis also comes with Ryzen AI 5 340 Processor same as ZenBook. But the display of this laptop is not as good as ZenBook. looks wise i like ZenBook more but this is pretty good too. If i customize this laptop then the cost increases as:\n\n* \\+4000Rs Warranties that are automatically added \n* \\+2000Rs Microsoft office extra\n* \\+4900Rs for 1TB Storage\n* \\+4200Rs for Ryzen AI 7 350\n* \\+3850Rs for *35.56cms (14) 2.8K (2880 x 1800), OLED, Glare, Non-Touch, HDR 1000 True Black, 100%DCI-P3, 1100 nits (HDR Peak)/500 nits (SDR Typical), 120Hz*\n\nThe cost might go upto 93k - 99k depending on the combo.

My main worry with a Lenovo is that the last one I got, I ended up returning it because it ran into a TON of issues within a week of barely using it - BSOD for no reason, wouldn't correct to wifi after initial updates, delayed keyboard feedback, stuff like that. It was an IdeaPad though, and those are trash anyways (I dunno what I was thinking, getting it in the first place, tbh).\nLooking to get something that'll work for me in college. I am taking art classes and a touch screen laptop would be great. If this, the Yoga, is junk, what else should I look at? Thought about Samsung, but I'm also rather unfamiliar with those too. Are they better for drawing and general school work? Was looking at the 360 ones, but I was a tad worried about the glass screen (hopefully I'm thinking of the right thing) cause I tend to damage things just by looking at them, somehow. \n\nSoooooo.

Not surprising if it's true, it's a dumpster fire over here right now.\n\nNo easy access to huawei that I know of, over here; looks like ebay would be the best option for getting one.

Highly reccomend Lenovo UK website to order. \n\nAnyway, the laptop is better than I thought, I'm a student so that will be my sole purpose of use, I have a phone to watch ny yt videos and stuff, I just need Microsoft 365 and Google for research. \n\nWarning: it really isn't a gaming laptop from what I can tell, however you can still play but I don't think you will get the most out of the games. \n\nPossitives:\nThe screen is beautiful 😍  I paid extra for the 2.8k oled and it was worth it, crisp, sharp, colourful and overall vibrant. \n\nIt's a touch screen, using my fingers is smooth, you can adjust the settings for touch sensitivity which I did, it's responsive, smooth and quick. I'm not sure about the pen I'll mention that in the negatives. \n\nThe sound is beautiful, it's louder, and alot clear compared to my previous laptop. No issues with sound and comes from both sides of laptop which is good. \n\nMakes zero noise, since I got it and I've put the updates on, which was super quick by the way, but it's silent. Probably no sound or if there is a sound I cannot hear it. I can hear a fan it's pretty peaceful. \n\nCharges super quick.\n\nPen charges super quick and battery lasts a few days depending on use. \n\nI've used the laptop all day working and researching and it's smooth, handles the workload well, and hasn't heat up like my older laptop which heat up and made a bit of noise when the workload got heavy. \n\nThe battery has last me from 5pm Thursday to 10pm Friday night. I'm happy with this, I was constantly updating, and doing my studies so it definitely holds up good. \n\nYou can remove the ai features which I did. \n\nSimple setup \n\nLooks beautiful especially in Tidal Teal\n\n14inch is big enough for carrying around. The 16 inch is similar in price but I personally found it too big and heavy the 14 inch is the right weight and perfect screen size. And honestly the 16 inch in general is far too big to carry around unless you plan to keep it in one place. \n\nNegatives: \nThe hinges don't seem strong. I hate to say this. It's a shame but I will probably not be using tablet mode, although when placed in tablet and tent mode it's still smooth and works great. But the hinges are a bit concerning. When in laptop mode the screen wobbles a bit too much. So yeah those hinges are a concern... \n\nRyzen ai 7 350 is meh. It's still fast and smooth but it's definitely not as amazing as I thought. I would reccomend the intel version over the amd ai. But it's still a good laptop for school work \n\nThe pen is not as sensitive as the finger, they send the new release yoga pen with the laptop and it isn't the best. Better off getting another type of pen.\n\nThe slot for the memory card looks concerning, I have not tried it yet but I'm not sure if I will..doesn't look like it will ever come back out. \n\nYou'll forever be cleaning the laptop no matter how much you wash your hands and they are clean this laptop is a magnetic for finger prints, the keyboard too. The touchscreen isn't that bad I've not had to clean it much. \n\nOverall I reccomend this laptop to students \n\n",
  "Hi , thank you very much for this review, I'm looking into buying the exact same model , but I have a few doubts could you please clarify them \n\nU mentioned this is a touchscreen \nThe same model i found: [here on lenovo ](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-pro-series/lenovo-yoga-pro-7-gen-10-14-inch-amd/83kgcto1wwin1?cid=in:sem:218hlv&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22385956031&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxo_CBhDbARIsADWpDH7jP6TxR9xBBmBMBMnYZi8RqzEZzOIFA1zIGyXw4jR5ZWVppoYqErsaAlw9EALw_wcB) \n\nSays it isn't touchscreen, can u confirm both are the same models \n\nI do not game , my use case for laptop is dev and design (figma and davinci resolve) , so do u still recommend this laptop?\n\nThis is costing me 725 pounds due to corporate discounts , is this a steal?",
  "Hi all, sorry if I haven't replied ive been busy with work and school work, \n\nJust an update, my laptop refuses to update, and the screen freezes consistently and doesnt save my work after, its always a reboot job, the track pad doesnt recognise my finger sometimes and lags sometimes the pointer goes missing on the screen and then... freezes all after a few updates. Before the update laptop was good. \n\nI would not recommend this for gaming and work in general it struggles to deal with basics. \n\nWhen laptop lid is closed it doesnt save anything, it will turn everything off ive changed setting etc and still doesnt just standy. \n\nUpdate seems to have left out important bits because new update refuses to download and says error. \n\nBeautiful looking laptop but not functional.",
  "u/Busy-Objective9718 Thanks for the post, currently looking at similar model. What did you not like about Ryzen AI 7 350?",
  "Still hinge issues!",
  "u/Busy-Objective9718 Where did you get it? I'm looking for that exact one but can't find it anywhere.",
  "Thanks for sharing. I recently bought a Lenovo yoga 7 2-in-1 touchscreen laptop too. I was hesitant since I’ve heard the hinges might become a problem in the future. I’m going to use it pretty much only for school so tablet mode is not too necessary",
  "Hi, what is your conclusion after a few months with this laptop, would you still recommend it? I'm considering buying it for school however I want to make sure im not disappointed. Thanks!",
  "I had an awful experience with this laptop (Yoga 7 14\" 2-in-1, 14AKP10). The sound drivers were so bad that even three OS reinstalls and a BIOS update didn't help. There were some AMD/Realtek sound issues that couldn't be fixed at the time (maybe because the CPU was brand new, or for some other reasons). The sound from the laptop's speakers was laggy. I tried all the suggestions from Reddit and other relevant websites and decided to return the laptop after a few days.",
  "That's not the same model, you've chosen none touch screen you have to change your options. \n\nBut in all honesty go for another laptop unless you dont mind disappointment",
  "Hey, I am currently trying to get my refund for Yoga 7 Gen 7 (14ARB7), which is basically 3 gen older than your laptop due to the screen freeze issue.\nThe screen freeze issue is a symptom of BSOD for 14ARB7, which many owners worldwide complain about this issue. Can you go to C:\\Windows\\Minidump and check whether is there any minidump there? If yes, is the bugcheck code DPC Watchdog Violation?",
  "Tbf, if you fancy a ai 7 350 but have a few money to spare i would reccomend to ai 9 hx 370 💯  \n\nI think for what I use the laptop for (school work, word, Google and researching the laptop is have handles it good) but if I was to to other stuff which are way more demanding it would struggle a bit. \n\nI wish I paid an extra for the 370 tbf and I would have removed the pen option. And I would have got it in silver the Tidal Teal shows the finger prints too blatantly no matter how much you wash your hands and clean the laptop. \n\nIf you're using the laptop for heavy professional stuff like editing gaming definitely upgrade... for light work like browsing and Microsoft 365 etc get the 350",
  "Yeah, seems like it. It seems safe using it as a laptop though but I wouldn't use it as a tablet just seems too fragile.",
  "Leneovo UK website . I'm in the UK",
  "Honestly, with the price point you can get a better spec, this laptop has its issues or \"teething problems\" yes it looks pretty, vibrant and colourful but it can lack in the performance, for example it freezes a lot when in tablet mode, the side buttons turn the laptop off when accidently pressed, the pen is not that great, the pen also leaves a lot of marks on the laptop screen which is hard to get off, almost like faint scratches, but the pen in general does not respond well to laptop and is not smooth, the laptop mouse or trackpad freezes, although the recent update did fix this, but ill be honest the tent mode and tablet mode freezes a lot, not sure why. \n\nThe hinges look weak! However not broken so far so cant be as bad as they look \n\nThe laptop for the price is not worth it and I recall somebody on here telling me to get a better spec but I didnt listen and I wish I did. \n\nThe web cam is terrible too almost like sometjing from the year 2000\n\nBattery life is terrible even in the power saver mode its awful lasts me around 4 hours maybe 5 when in heavy use my Dell lasted me 8 hours straight. This laptop needs charging often \n\n\nThe positives are I managed to turn AI features off besides a few which is great! \n\nThe 14inch is a godsend its perfect!!! If you plan to use it as a tablet or tent mode do not get anything bigger it will just feel and look awful and chunky \n\nThe laptop is slim in design looks sleek. \n\nBattery charges super quick like very quick the first charge I did up to 100 and then after that I set it to 80 to protect the battery life spam and it makes no difference either way it needs charging after 4 or 5 hours or heavy use. \n\nIts bright, the display is gorgeous 😍 \n\nIf I could return it and choose another I would opt for a thinkpad and opt for specs, performance over looks and the tablet mode gimmick \n\nHave a look after to see if there are better specs for the similar price range and ask ppl on reddit who know about laptops they gave me good advice which I didnt lsiten to much",
  "Do not buy it if you will enable virtualization feature and use touchscreen/touchpad. This freezing issue is reported since 2022 and Lenovo does nothing to solve it. \n\nThe [freezing issue ](https://forums.lenovo.com/topic/findpost/1516/5259004/6550013)occurs since Yoga 7 Gen 7 (14ARB7) and is likely still present in all newer models.",
  "Too late :( , i got mine  a week back , I had troubles on linux and jus 6 hours battery on power saving mode, what about you",
  "Thanks for sharing!",
  "Thanks, that explains why I can't find it.",
  "How much would you say is a fair price for this device?",
  "Oh dear, I do a bit of work on mine these days but around 5 hours battery saver mode\n\nIt gets worse after each update im not sure why\n\nI have 10 months warranty im thinking about taking it back in however I really need a laptop for work so im trying to finish off my work first lol",
  "I would get it in intel if you're thinking about it and also if you really want amd go for ryzen 9 ai 370 if you can get it",
  "I can't answer that. A device is only worth what you're willing to pay",
  "It even feels slow for it's specs",
  "Thanks, but I have somewhat bad prior experience with Intel (typing this now on a Yoga 7 with Intel 1260p) and their integrated graphics, especially on Linux. AMD on the other hand works like a dream, and Linux support for AMDGPU is the best of the bunch by far. That's why your laptop is exactly what I was looking for. And yes, getting a HX370 is next to impossible now. I guess AMD has really low yields with 300 series and all 370s and above end up in high-end devices with dedicated graphics (like ProArt and Zephyrus) - which doesn't make sense as 890M is already a really powerful GPU. But given no desktop-replacement GPUs from AMD right now (no 9000 mobile series yet) it seems the high-end gaming will be stealing our AMD CPU supply for some time to come.",
  "Yes ofc. You said you felt it wasn't worth the price. So I was wondering how much you spent on it",
  "Yep unfortunately I went for a 2 in 1 and lenovo focused on looks over anything else",
  "That's really interesting,  im a big fan of amd and and dont think I've ever used an intel except for at work maybe, but this is the only laptop I found intel runs so smoothly and is probs a bit better and for the life of me I cant figure out why. \n\nIt does do the job though, I only use it for research and Microsoft 360 light browsing so it fits me needs don't think its good enough as a gaming laptop",
  "I paid £995 when first released \n\nYou can get a better spec with this price",
  "Sorry double checked invoice I paid £1055 including blue light card discount",
  "Hp omen max with 5080 or Lenovo legion pro 7 with 5070ti Pretty much the same price on black Friday deals. I have no experience with gaming laptops but this is where I’ve narrowed it down. \n\nThe specs would say probably HP, I think the ram speed is a little slower on the hp but that’s it. Build quality, experience with one or both, or just opinions would be welcomed",
  "Tough one the 16 go of vram vs 12 on the legion but I would compare the cpu and screens. Do you have the details?  Not all  hp omen max come with oled screens, so that’s a plus for the legion. Plus the legion typically uses the faster ddr5-6400 ram.  I have a legion pro 5 and have been really happy and typically online reviewers prefer the legions over hp.  Is there a store you can go look at em? The touch of the keyboard or track pad might be an instant no go.",
  "Yeah I realized after posting this that the omen doesn’t have the oled screen. Got caught spec chasing and didn’t realize. Now I’m trying to decide whether to get the 5070ti legion with intel i9 or 5080 with amd 9950hdx",
  "Lenovo Yoga pro 7i aura vs Slim 7i aura. Hi. I want someone to help me decide between these two models. After reading many reviews i decide to go with intel version instead of Amd.

I’m so confused on what to get and was hoping for some help. \n\nP.s I don’t really upgrade tech that often. I use the same thing for like 5-7+ years",
  "OP, MacBook Pro M4 is better for long-term performance, battery life, & macOS ecosystem, while Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 offers more ports, a brighter OLED screen,&  better multi-core CPU power for a lower price, choose MacBook for longevity & Lenovo for Windows flexibility and display.",

  "Okay I'm a CS grad as well, with industry and research experience so let me give you my opinion on this. \n\nThe nix shell or the posix shell is better yes and you'll be better suited with it, but considering budget and pragmatism,  you can also use windows subsystem for linux or wsl. So right now, the main deciding factor for you should be which os you're more comfortable with? Hardware specs are one thing but if you have to sacrifice years of workflow and familiarity it's not worth switching. So if you're on Windows now, stay on Windows. If you've been on macOS, stay on macOS. \n\nAnd obviously cost is a no brainer. If you want more bang for the buck and the Windows machine does your job, why not? \n\nP.S. - 32 GB should make it a breeze to run WSL as the underlying VM takes up about 4GB and you can shut it down when you don't need it.
