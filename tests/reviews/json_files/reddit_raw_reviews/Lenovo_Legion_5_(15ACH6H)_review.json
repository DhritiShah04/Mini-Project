  "Lenovo legion 5 15ach6h 120hz 250 nits Hi guy. Looking for my firl gaming laptop\n\nIm wondering if anyone has the legion 5 ryzen 5 5600H RTX 3060 with the 120hz, 250 nits display? Im just a bit confused about that display as many reviewers don't recommend it (not bright enough and has bad color accuracy)",
  "I don't know if this helps but I have the previous generation with the Ryzen 5 4600H and GTX 1650TI, 250 nit 120hz screen and it is quite dim I have it on max brightness all the time or it's unreadable in anything but a dark room.  If I was struggling at max brightness to read the screen I would have returned it.",
  "Yea it has 25% Rec2020 (60% sRGB, 45% NTSC, 40% DCI-P3 / AdobeRGB). That means you'll see 25% of all visible colors and only 40% of the original colors in content like movies and games.\n\nWith Legion 5 series, you want the 165Hz display.",
  "Thank you. The thing is i can get the 120 hz screen variant much cheaper than the 165hz. \n\nDo you think it's a deal breaker for an average gamer?",
  "I think so, yes. Add to that, 250 Nits is a whole other deal breaker on its own.",
  "Thank you, much appreciated"
