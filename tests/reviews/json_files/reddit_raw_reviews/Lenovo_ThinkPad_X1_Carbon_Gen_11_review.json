  "Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11 - But which configuration Hi all! I will start to work as a bioinformatician and therefore I'm in the need of a new notebook. I think the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11 is the perfect match for me, due to many positive reviews, its longevity, the keyboard, and its light weight. Of course, it's also a high-end business laptop. \n\nHowever, I'm a little bit overwhelmed by the amount of different configurations I can choose from. It should be powerful enough for my work, but I don't want to overkill on some parts.  For now I'm thinking about getting it with 32GB RAM (due to large datasets + ML + future proofing) and a 256 GB SSD (Will upgrade it in the future and save some money now). However, I have no clue which CPU I should get. I can choose between i7-1355U, i5-1335U, i5-1345U, i7-1365U and the i7-1370P. \n\nFrom what I've heard is the U version a low power version, that will be better for battery life and heat. But I don't know if it will too weak. Can anybody help me out? :) I would be grateful for any kind of advice!  \n\nBest ",

  "Help deciding between these Lenovo ThinkPad and Dell Inspiron laptops - any insight appreciated I need to make a decision on a new laptop and could use help deciding. I'm down to the ones listed in the below table (though if you think I should consider a different one let me know). I don't use this for anything particularly intensive or specific (e.g., no gaming, programming, CAD, etc), this is just an all-around laptop. I would say my main criteria is reliability/build quality - I tend to keep laptops a long time (e.g. 8-10 years) so I want this to last a long time. That said, I would appreciate a nice screen (I do use it for some photo/video editing) and would like decent battery life (though it spends most of its time plugged in).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/709cqhhecbke1.jpg?width=1110&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee5190ab219f2ce43705c9a4dff1d2b935e69fc9\n\nHere is my current thinking on these - I would appreciate anyone's input/thoughts, personal experience, etc.\n\n* **Lenovo vs. Dell** \\- I like Lenovo a lot, I have one for my work computer and I love the keyboard. I'm leaning that way, but per the below I am trying to figure out why I wouldn't get the Dell...\n* **Yoga 9i** \\- I love this and this was going to be my choice (particularly love the design and screen), but I'm concerned about (i) only 16 GB of RAM (I could bump it up but that's $500-600 more) and (ii) lots of reviews say the real-world battery life is very poor.\n* **X1 Carbon Gen 11** \\- I know this is a prior gen but the new one is too expensive. Main concern with this one is the lower resolution screen (obviously has an older processor, but again shouldn't make a huge difference in what I use it for).\n* **ThinkPad T14** \\- This is obviously more expensive and has the same drawback of lower quality screen, but it's on the list because (i) it seems to be basically a tank that would last a long time (and could be easily repaired if need be) and (ii) it comes with a 3-year warranty.\n* **Dell Inspiron** \\- The background here is I went to Micro Center to try out the Lenovos and saw the stats on this one and I'm basically trying to figure out what the catch is with this. It generally has the same or better specs than all the others for quite a bit cheaper. What is the catch or drawback with this one? My one concern (other than the fact that I must be missing something) is that it has a lower brightness of 300 nits (which I feel could be an annoyance when using it in a bright room for example).\n\nI hope to buy this in the next day or so, so thanks for all the help!",

The company said that it’d be a company expense as long as the model is approved. She says that since everything else in the office is a Lenovo she’d stick with that, so it also doesn’t need to be Thinkpad but is very preferred. She offloaded looking for the laptop to me. The laptop should be 14”+, Win 11 Pro, i5+.\n\nAt first I was looking at the X1 Carbon which is 2.5 pounds but kept running into its only problem of all things being thermals. It’s a great laptop, but I don’t think she’ll tolerate it or try and use tricks to make it better. Right now I’m looking at either a T14 Gen 4/5 (Gen 5 is brand new with no reviews) or T14S Gen 5/6 (same for Gen 6) which is 2.8 or 2.9 pounds. Which would you recommend between these two for thermals? What about other Thinkpads? Other Lenovos? Thermals are really the main concern.

  "Old ones okay maybe if decently priced. Problem are new ones, being super overpriced while offering very little. An example : A mid range T14 G5 with a core ultra 5 125U, 60hz 1200p sRGB IPS display, 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage, which for those two are getting below today's standard, is priced at 1200€. Those are specs you'd find on a 600-700€ laptop, not a 1200€ laptop. At 1000€ you can already get something well built with a Ryzen 7 8th gen, 32gb of ram and 1tb of storage (Asus Zenbook, HP Elitebook, etc). In this case that laptop OP showed was a pretty fine deal, but if you took a Thinkpad for the same price you'd have an E14 Gen 6 with even worse specs. They stay good, don't get me wrong : but at any price range there's pretty much always a better deal.",

  "Keyboard's alright. As for the burn in, I think it'll be fine, especially if you don't run max brightness (the screen is very bright, even half brightness is much brighter than most laptop screens) and auto hide taskbar. Bonus point if you use a OLED friendly theme (iirc the O365 suite has one where the background and ui is pure black). Those are only preventive measures and not really 100% necessary unless you're really scared.",

  "so the intel would be the better choice ? between it doesn't have the multi threading capabilities, that's why i hesitate",

  "Help me choose: Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 13 or HP Elitebook X G1a Hi folks, can you please share your thoughts on this choice? Particularly on real life usage, robustness, keyboard, display, and overall experience? \n\nI read tens of reviews, and technically understand them, but no chance of touch these laptops before I buy one, and I miss the real life feelings to make my choice.\n\nI need a work laptop, and choosing between the two:  \n1) Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 13, Intel 258V chip, 1TB ssd, 32GB, 2.8K non-touch OLED,  \n2) HP Elitebook X G1a, AMD HX PRO 375 chip, 1TB ssd, 32GB, 2.8K non-touch OLED.\n\nMy use case and needs:  \n\\- scientific computations (preliminary and analisys on laptop, normal on big servers)  \n\\- C++ programming  \n\\- photography and some design (Photoshop, raw converters, Illustrator, databasing)  \n\\- almost no gaming (I have a dedicated gaming desktop)  \n\\- most work is on desk with additional displays etc  \n\\- at the same time, I need decent portability, as I go to work 2hrs on train several times a week + business trips are work-on-go by nature\n\nMy final thoughts:  \n\\- Currently, I have Lenovo X1 carbon gen 5, which I LOVE, the keyboard, the portability, the best on class display, it's robustness is really great. And I really appreciate it works good after 8 years, I don't like to refresh often. But yeah it gets outdated, I feel the lack of cpu power etc.  \n\\- I like the power specs of AMD 375 in HP. I have big servers for really long calculations, but still a lot of computation, programming, photoediting, all these require cpu power.   \n\\- I like light weight of Lenovo, and I like my current Lenovo, but Intel 258V is so frustratingly slower than AMD 375. It may play no role now, particularly considering I have servers for computations. Still in 4 or 5 years it may make a lot of difference...\n\nThanks for reading all this, and particularly if you can add some value to this choice!",
  "Well, for comparison sake, I just 2 weeks ago bought the Elitebook X G1A with the 375, 64GB ram, touchscreen OLED and 2 TB SSD.  So that definitely shows which I'd choose.",
  "I purchased the Elitebook X GIa and am coming off a Latitude 9440 2 in 1. I was beginning to get tired of the lattice keyboard of the latter. The G1a has a fantastic keyboard, and the laptop itself is unbelievably fast.\n\nMost importantly, if the specs are good enough for you, please see the one on sale at Costco ($1599). This is a relatively new addition to Costco's line (including the G1i).\n\n[https://www.costco.com/s?keyword=elitebook](https://www.costco.com/s?keyword=elitebook)",
  "What you like and what you don't?",
  "Thanks, I'll check it. Not sure they do international delivery, though.\nYeah, the keyboard is critically important for me, I'm typing a lot, and I'm not used to the modern-ish keyboards at all. It limits my choice greatly. Is there anything you _dislike_ about this laptop, btw?",
  "I love the performance.  Totally embarrasses the Lunar Lake.  I like the battery life.  Yes, Lunar Lake is capable of much better battery life, but this is \"good enough\" for my needs (9+ hours), so any more than that is completely unnecessary.  I like the fact that I got SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much more performance for the same price.  I like the fact that I have 64GB ram (Lunar Lake maxes at 32).\n\nI don't like the OLED, they're horrible on battery.  But this is, as pointed out, still \"good enough\" due to that (reasonably) large battery.  Nice to finally see business models getting reasonable sized batteries.\n\nThe price I paid for my Elitebook (375/64/2TB/2.8K OLED) is the same as if I were to configure the X1C13 with 256V/16/512/WUXGA.  That's a LOT of extra for the same price.  And I happen to think the Elitebook looks better, to boot.  Obviously that's highly subjective.\n\nMy Elitebook (after I made a skin for it):\n\n[https://ibb.co/dJ2pMfVD](https://ibb.co/dJ2pMfVD)\n\n[https://ibb.co/RTj90zvC](https://ibb.co/RTj90zvC)\n\n[https://ibb.co/xS08Dw3r](https://ibb.co/xS08Dw3r)",
  "Sorry, I did not realize you needed to have it shipped overseas. That might be difficult, if not impossible, with Costco.\n\nIt is a little thick and heavy (almost 3.5 lbs), and the bottom chassis is more rounded than I like.  Battery life is ok. Maybe 6-7 hours of browsing on balanced power mode?\n\nBut overall, I like it. Very quiet and has a great port selection. Also, the lid is rigid and doesn't wobble when open, unlike the X G1i or the Omnibook Ultra that I had a chance to play with.",
  "Would you with hindsight bought had the 1080p IPS panel instead for the improved battery life? Or do the increased sharpness from the resolution bump of the OLED panel make up for it? Do you also have any new long term measurements about battery life, or is it still around 9 hours? What usage do you have when testing this?",
  "Thanks, understood. How badly glare is the display there, btw?",
  "Thanks, really appreciate the first hand experience!",
  "If they made the HX375 available with the IPS, I DEFINITELY would have bought it.  But HP only sells the HX375 with the OLED, and I wanted the HX375 more than I wanted good battery life on this particular machine.\n\nI have enabled the \"maximize battery health\" in hte bios, so I no longer get anywhere near 9 hours (max charge is now 80%).\n\nWhen testing, I'll have my browser with 4-5 tabs, email client, and local streaming music player running at a comfortable (on this brightness, that's 40%) but lowish brightness, and on high powered CPU's like this, I will enable most of the power saving features to maximize battery life (on U series CPU's I just set it to balanced).",

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Buying lenovo thinkpad e16 gen 2 and want to get the best deal ",
  "LOCKED BIOS - Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE) I bought a Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE) at an auction. The BIOS/UEFI is locked with a Supervisor Password. A repair shop reflashed both EEPROMs from scratch (64 MB BIOS REGION and 16 MB ME REGION), but the password remained. They concluded the password resides in the MEC1723N EC, which isn’t rewritable with conventional bench tools and also has epoxy underneath, making replacement difficult. I’m trying to contact the original company to have it cleared officially.\n\n**Device**  \nModel: ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (Intel), Type 21HE\n\n**Repair shop’s assessment**\n\n* From their investigation (including reading and analyzing the extracted hex), they did not find any sector in the EEPROMs where the password might be stored.\n* Conclusion from their studies: on some T14 units, the Supervisor Password is stored in the **Embedded Controller (EC)**, specifically the **MEC1723N**.\n\n**Practical issues:**\n\n* The MEC1723N would have internal firmware with no known method for reflashing using standard bench tools;\n* Lenovo uses black resin/epoxy under the chip, making desoldering/replacement almost unfeasible;\n* Even swapping in a “blank” chip would require the proper EC firmware, which the shop does not have.\n\n**Technical confirmation:**\n\n* On a **ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (21HE)** with **MEC1723N**, does the **Supervisor Password** indeed reside in the EC?\n* Has anyone here successfully **reprogrammed or replaced a MEC1723N** (preserving firmware integrity), or can confirm that it cannot be done without Lenovo’s proprietary resources/firmware?\n\n**Legitimate paths:**\n\n* Beyond **system board replacement** and the **official process via the previous owning company**, is there any **authorized route** (e.g., **Lenovo Authorized Service Centers**) that can **reflash/synchronize the EC** to clear the SVP?\n\nThank you.",
  "The MEC1723N does contain the SVP, and reading online from people who have attempted it, it is very much possible to remove the black resin, although with some roughness.\n\nhttps://www.badcaps.net/forum/troubleshooting-hardware-devices-and-electronics-theory/troubleshooting-laptops-tablets-and-mobile-devices/3498772-guide-to-transplant-mec1503-ec-chip-and-eeprom-reprogamming-for-t14s-gen-2-and-x13-gen-2\n\nMy best bet would be replacing the whole chip with a cleanly flashed one, and then after using this guide to change your model name, serial, etc back to original",

Whereas on a dark black screen, it's fine. I have also run a Display BIOS diagnosis and there on black screen no shade is see.

  "Is the Lenovo ThinkPad E16 gen 2 with HS processors undervolted? If not do they overheat? Hi Reddit, This is Kavin. My laptop had stopped working recently. So I was wondering if I could get a reliable laptop that could last me for the maximum amount of time. Of course, my first preference was to get a ThinkPad. I've done my research across all the other brands and ended up looking at a ThinkPad, which is pretty good in terms of specs. One thing that ached me was that this exact model has a HS processor, which might be undervolted by Lenovo; if not, it might overheat. I've attached a photo of this laptop and its naked back to give an idea of how it looks and show how big the fan and the heat sink are. This is the link to the laptop: [https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nx00](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nx00)\n\nThese are all the variants of the laptop: [https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/len101t0098?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252F&irclickid=xta2FnyEixycWL9XgKWeZxMQUkp20iUiCTv0W00&irgwc=1&Program=9634&pid=5215192&acid=ww%3Aaffiliate%3Alx67i4&cid=in%3Aaffiliate%3Afiv7n7](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/len101t0098?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252F&irclickid=xta2FnyEixycWL9XgKWeZxMQUkp20iUiCTv0W00&irgwc=1&Program=9634&pid=5215192&acid=ww%3Aaffiliate%3Alx67i4&cid=in%3Aaffiliate%3Afiv7n7)\n\n Found a good review: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNkDvzWrEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNkDvzWrEY)\n\n# Uses:\n\nLet me tell you what I'm gonna use this laptop for. I will use it for light gaming, school work (Projects), occasional edits and browsing. I'm not gonna game crazy hard, of course. But I will be playing games like Apex Legends, Counter-Strike 2, etc.\n\n# Expectations:\n\nI'm a 16-year-old guy. I expect this laptop to last me for a period of 5-7 years. I don't want anything like hardware requirements to stop me from doing my work, which is mostly school work, some light games, and university projects. I wanna make the most out of this laptop, so pls put your recommendations on how to use it efficiently or the first things to do on this laptop (pls don't tell me not to play games). In conclusion, I want a smooth time with this laptop.\n\n# Questions:\n\n1. Is this undervolted by Lenovo?\n2. Will it overheat? (Are the thermals good enough to support this processor?)\n3. Should I go for this one instead (Which has Ryzen 5 U processor): [https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nr00](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/lenovo-thinkpad-e16-gen-2-16-inch-amd/21m5s0nr00)\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nI would like to know what you ppl think. I would really like some recommendations that fulfil all my needs around this price range. Pls answer my questions, guys (would really appreciate it). Pls let me know what I'll have to buy(Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7) according to my needs and preferences. Also, feel free to ask me anything you need to know in order to clarify my doubts. Lastly, thank you for reading and providing your opinion, guys. Hope this helps me and others, too.",

  "legion 5 is better long term stronger cpu more ram cooler temps storage you can upgrade later ram matters now helios has nicer screen but legion is more reliable"
