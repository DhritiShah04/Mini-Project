  "If you want to game go on with the Lenovo, since and graphics still Performa better than intel's in most games",
  "If you can configure the thinkpad then what I would do is configure it with less RAM and storage, then add the necessary RAM & SSD yourself, it will be cheaper and you can sell the unused components on ebay. The thinkpad has 2 ram slots so it is upgradeable",
  "Fair, I was thinking the same. I already had a Lenovo and liked it. IdeaPad 3 running AMD Ryzen 7 5700U. Guess this one is better?",
  "Well I've never done it before but I might give it a try. I know I'll find great YouTube tutorials. Thank you!",
  "Usually with ThinkPads you just unscrew all the screws on the bottom and the back pops off, then you get access to the ram and storage",
  "Lenovo Thinkbook 16p Gen 6 (2025) Hello everyone, for those who have the Thinkbook 16p Gen 6 (2025), can you give us a brief review on perfomance, display, keyboard, constructive quality and of course.. some photos?\nThank you",
  "Hey recently I bought it from china will use it and let yall know \n\nSpecs \nUltra 9 275HX\n32Gigs of ram\nrtx 5070\n1 tb ssd",
  "I am also interested to know more about this product.",
  "Greattttt",
  "Hey so here are my thoughts on my laptop.\n\nI also do not know anything about its gaming capabilities as i have only played Forza horizon 4 on it and its an absolute breeze but I believe the 5070 will hold up\n\nSo my main use case is on Ansys mechanical and Optislang so I don’t find delays of any sort and also when using the GPU acceleration my simulations run pretty quickly as compared to my previous laptop which had a i5-1240p with no graphics card and the difference is astronomical especially all CAD tasks are smooth as butter with that said I do feel that the battery like could be improved as on a single charge it only lasts about 4.5 hours  and prolly 6 hours of light usage and also the magic bay i have not used it but i feel it is not really required.\n\nThe build quality is top notch\nThe keyboard is also good but not thinkpad p1 level \nAnd display is actually pretty good\n\nAlso there is little to no thermal throttling so far and the fans don’t even spin at light use cases\n\nAnyways my verdict is that it’s a really good laptop go for it if your budget allows you to. It costed almost  $1900",
  "ThinkBook 16p Gen 6: dGPU via Thunderbolt? ",
  "Lenovo Ideapad slim 3 gen 10 AMD 14\" So i bought this laptop for £469 in the UK for university and i have had it for about a week now and I have not seen any reviews so i thought i would leave a review. It has a ryzen 5 8640hs with integrated radeon graphics, 16gb ram dual channel and a 60wh battery\n\nBuild quality: This laptop is made of sturdy plastic, the finish feels very nice but it is nothing to boast about, it is good enough for the price. I like how it is very lightweight and is really easy to carry around.\n\nDisplay: The anti-glare coating is great for this and really helps when it is sunny outside and the sun is very bright. 1920x1200 is very sharp but other than that its a regular 60hz IPS panel but it definitely gets the job done.\n\nKeyboard: This one does not come with a full size keyboard but I am not too bothered by this personally as I dont usually use the rest of the other keys. Sometimes I do press the wrong keys but once you get used to it, its a solid keyboard.\n\nPerformance: The CPU in this is very fast, whatever I do happens in an instant whether im video editing, watching videos, playing games or in a meeting. The 16gb ram also plays a huge role in this. What surprised me the most was the performance of the GPU considering its only 15W. I dont play very heavy games but this GPU was able to run forza horizon 4, fortnite, GTA, battlefield 1 and hollow Knight at good fps(these are the games I usually play). I also did some wii u emulation and it was flawless. One thing I will mention is that the laptop can be quite noisy when gaming on extreme performance mode but is very quiet when not being pushed.\n\nBattery: The battery on this is great for what it is. I was able to achieve around 7-8 hours from 100 percent to 20 whilst just doing my assignments(on battery saver). I got around 5-6 hours on netflix. When gaming the max i got was around 3 hours of battery life which is not too bad.",
  "wow thanks for this review! I was thinking of getting this laptops but couldn't find a lot of reviews so thanks <3",
  "Nice review, I just bought the version with AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS with dual RAM of 8 GB each. I hope I don't regret it, but the price of €630 seemed very advantageous to me honestly",
  "How good an idea is it to get this same version but with 24GB of RAM for $800? Considering that I live in Chile and our prices tend to be higher than those in first-world countries.",
  "Hi! Thanks for the review. Do you think it's worth getting the Ryzen 78840HS version for 40€ more?? I'm gonna be using it for university work. Music production software and other music related software and some gaming",
  "Hi, I am interested of this Laptop, i.e. the 8840HS variant, supports DP alt mode 1.4 on the USB-C port.",
  "I know it's an old post but how is the laptop holding up so far ?",
  "Hi I’ve had this laptop for over a month now and it’s been pretty good thus far but have a few issues/concerns and wanted to see if others are having! 1. The trackpad is not good my fingers dont move on it well and it doesn’t feel sturdy it feels pretty cheap. 2. I might of banged it at some stage but I noticed with the display when it shows black things the pixels are blue in a certain spot only a little you can barely notice it but it bothers me.",
  "No problem its a great laptop for its price, still going strong right now",
  "How is the battery?",
  "As far as I'm aware the \"24GB\" version doesn't exist, it can just support up to 24GB, as in you need to buy extra memory and install it yourself. If that's 800USD that's a disgusting price. Are Apple products also more expensive there? Personally I'd be looking into an Air M4 for that price.",
  "Dont get it, its not worth it at that price point",
  "Absolutely, that ryzen 7 is quite a bit faster and will be better for running multiple tasks, the igpu on it is slightly faster than the ryzen 5 one by about 10%. For €40 more yeah i would say its worth it",
  "Cant really say but its most likely similar to this one but with a stronger gpu and cpu",
  "Its holding up great the battery and performance is still good",
  "In reality it has yet to arrive, they're taking a long time to ship and maybe I'm changing my mind, opting for a thinkpad for €100 more though",
  "Hi, this I assume. Does your model support DP Alt Mode 1.4?",
  "I can buy the slim 3, witht he ryzen 7 only 16gb ram and 60Wh battery for £466, worth ?",
  "ciao, potresti fare un aggiornamento? quale PC hai preso alla fine? a che thinkpad stavi pensando? ti trovi bene?",
  "Whats that",
  "Yeah thats worth it",
  "This is the standard describing how video signals are sent over the USB-C port. ",
  "Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Gen 6: First impressions I purchased the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G6, model 21NQCTO1WWBR1 on July 2025 and would like to make my impressions about this product:\n\nDESIGN AND BUILD: We don't have much to comment on the design, as it's quite minimalist. We're surprised that not all the keyboard keys follow Lenovo's signature layout, as is typical on IdeaPads, but at least the Ctrl and Fn keys are in their traditional positions, unlike ThinkPads. The light color isn't bad, but it's a shame there wasn't a darker color option (not black, which is typically only seen on ThinkPads, but a darker gray would have been nice). The touchpad is a good size. We found the number of ports interesting, but the Ethernet port's position wasn't particularly helpful, being on the right side. It's interesting that it also has an SD card reader. The number of LEDs also caught our attention, with one next to each USB-C port, in addition to the power button itself (which we really like being separate from the keyboard). We liked the backlit keyboard and the dedicated \"?\", \"/\", \"°\", and \"Menu\" keys, although they sacrificed one of the Ctrl keys. At least it didn't come with the \"Copilot\" shortcut. We didn't really like the notch in the webcam area and found it a rather questionable design decision, but we understand its usefulness. We also liked that it came without those infamous labels on the palm rest, just the Intel seal.\n\nSCREEN: We liked the quality of the IPS, but we were disappointed that the screen had excessive IPS Glow at the bottom edge, quite visible with the screen on a black background even in bright light. My brother was okay with it, but I didn't like this defect at all, which I'm already accepting is quite common in current LCD screens, as I've also seen notebooks and even smartphones and tablets from other brands with this issue. It shouldn't happen, but we've come to understand that IPS Glow is now part of the experience of having an IPS LCD screen, which is unfortunate. At least we like the thin bezels.\n\nSOUND AND WEBCAM: Neither impressed in any aspect, but neither disappointed.\n\nBATTERY AND CHARGING: The USB-C charger is interesting. My brother tested it by playing YouTube videos in 1080p with maximum brightness, and it lasted over 5 hours unplugged. For a 60Wh battery, it's an okay battery, but it could be better.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND USABILITY: Regarding performance, considering its specifications, I consider it okay. It worked very well even for running virtual machines via VirtualBox. We didn't notice excessive heat on the keyboard when heavily loaded. My brother installed the Big Linux distro, and in testing, it has worked well, including mirroring the laptop screen to our Smart TV wirelessly. My brother was unable to get BlissOS, based on Android 13, to work, as it didn't recognize Wi-Fi, but emulating Android on Big Linux with WayDroid has worked well most of the time.\n\n**Have you also purchased a Lenovo ThinkBook? Share your experiences with it in the comments below.**",
  "Looks cool",
  "I got the same laptop, with 8gb of RAM, and im quite satisfied with it. I use it mainly for college stuff, and it can handle an entire day of coding, browsing the internet and even playing some light games (such as Horizon Chase). \n\nBattery life on it is quite impressive on linux. I get 6-8h of usage with it. That's more than i get with Windows (i have no idea why i just get 3-5 hours on Windows), but i've seen some minor compatibility issues on linux, such as the mute key not lighting up or the volume keys getting \"sticky\" (if i hold it a little bit, it goes to max volume or 0), but overall, the laptop is very usable.\n\nI plan to upgrade to 16gb soon, because on my use case, 8gb is too low, especially when i get 16 tabs open for research + some niche software from 10 years and VScode.\n\nOBS: Você é o CAVBR do fórum Adrenaline, não é?",
  "What cpu is in there? Seems like an older one",
  "So, how are you liking it after 2 months?\nI'm between this one, Yoga 7i and Vivobook s 14, but there are not many reviews on this thinkbook.",
  "Isso mesmo.",
  "Intel Core i5-13420H.\n\nIn other countries, Lenovo has already launched ThinkBook Gen 8, but in Brazil (where I live), curiously, it recently launched Gen 6.\n\nIn fact, while in most countries, they're already launching models with the new Intel Core Series 1 and 2, in Brazil, the number of laptops with Intel Core 13th Gen has now increased.",
  "O meu irmão está usando, e não está reclamando. Só por ter como atualizar os dois pentes de RAM, ficaria com o ThinkBook.",

  "Which is better — ThinkBook 16 Gen 7 or ThinkPad E14 Gen 6? Hey everyone, I’m trying to decide between the ThinkBook 16 Gen 7 and the ThinkPad E14 Gen 6. I’ve heard mixed opinions.\n\nFrom what I see, the specs are very similar: both have aluminum tops and plastic bottoms. I haven’t seen a huge difference in build quality in real life. But a lot of people claim that newer ThinkPad E-series models are much better now than they used to be—and even better than ThinkBook in many respects.\n\nSo my question is: is it really worth paying ₹7000 extra for the ThinkPad?\n\nIf any of you have observed major differences (durability, thermal performance, screen, support, value, etc.), please drop your experience below. \n\nThanks in advance",
  "My personal preference is the ThinkPad, but I'd probably buy the ThinkBook in this case.  I have the E14 Gen6 (7735U but with the 57wh battery), and I have the ThinkBook 14 G8 (255H) and while the ThinkBook LOOKS better, the Thinkpad is better made.  Beyond that, they have EXTREMELY similar specs, and very similar max specs, so IMO the ThinkPad despite being better made, isn't so much better made that it's worth the extra $$.",

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Hi.  I've tried the 16gb version and would like the 32gb version but it doesn't seem to be available anywhere in the Uk with 32gb ram.  With the 16gb ram version, it shows only about 8gb ram available at idle (no internet connection, nothing actively running).  So I think it needs 32gb.  It's a nice laptop though.  It would be great for a studen and I reckon it would last 5 years unless you drop it.  But would you need to use any graphics intensive programs with your studies?  If so you might want something with dedicated graphics (but then maybe college computers have that?).",

  "Need help choosing a programming laptop - ThinkPad L14 Gen 5 vs HP EliteBook 845 G10 # Hey everyone! I'm looking for a laptop for programming and studying. Here's what I need:\n\n* Decent performance\n* Good battery life\n* Nice screen\n* Upgradeable RAM\n* Budget around 25,000 UAH (I'm from Ukraine)\n* Overall good build quality and pleasant to use\n\nI've narrowed it down to these three options:\n\n**1. ThinkPad L14 Gen 5 - Ryzen 5 7535U** \\- 25,000 UAH\n\n* Screen is probably 45% NTSC (will need to replace if true)\n* Keyboard layout doesn't work for me (will replace)\n* 57Wh battery\n\n**2. EliteBook 845 G10 - Ryzen 5 7540U** \\- 25,000 UAH\n\n* 100% sRGB screen\n* Keyboard works for me\n* 51Wh battery\n\n**3.

My main questions are:\n\n* Which one will be the most powerful?\n* Which one will have the best battery life?\n\nI'll probably run Linux on it. Might do some light gaming, but the main use will be programming and work  \nstuff.\n\nAny advice on which one to go with? Thanks!\n\nI'd also love to know more details about these processors. Which one is more powerful and which is more energy efficient? Is it worth getting the 7545U, or will it act weird like Intel chips do with their efficiency cores",

As far as I know, for 2TB size, only Samsung that have single-sided sticks (they use 1TB NAND chips each to make it possible). There's still plenty of single-sided choices though for 1TB size. Make sure you ask the seller or look for reviews for that specific size. \n\nOn my current laptop (HP Omen16 2021), I have 2 slots, but only one slot that can fit double-sided NVMe. The other one can only fit single-sided sticks since the bottom of the socket has a piece of metal that connects directly to the cooling system to actively help cooling the NVME. On the other hand, my older laptop (MSI P65 Prestige), have two sockets as well but both sockets support double-sided sticks.",

Hi, I have a Lenovo Thinkbook 13s Gen 3 ACN (R7 5800U)\n\nLately the clock on this thing has been very unstable, with the time gradually shifting out-of-sync after a few hours, this made me have to manually sync the time every few hours to keep the laptop's services running smoothly. \n\nBut every now and then when I boot on the laptop it'll beep really loud with an error code (I don't remember the code) with the desc. saying along the line of bios time incorrect.\n\nSo I decided to go in the BIOS and manually adjust the time, but after booting back on the time still keeps gradually shifting out-of-sync. \nP/S: somehow this \"time error\" thing also affects my laptop boot time, making it really slow for the lenovo logo to appear after pressing the power.\n\nSo this is where I am right now: I figured out it must've been the CMOS battery that's causing this, so I opened up the laptop (i was going go reset the bios) and disconnected the battery, held the pwr button for 30 seconds then reconnected the battery and booted it back on, but this time there's no display but the fans were spinning and the power indicator light were on.\n\nSo I opened up the laptop again for the second time, disconnected the battery and held the pwr for 60 secs (and 120 secs the third time) then left the battery disconnected for more than 30 mins then proceeded to plug it in again. Still no display.\n\nI looked up everything from reddit to youtube and so far nothing has helped me, even the holding down pwr for 60 seconds while unplugged on youtube did not help. \n\nI also tried unplugging the battery and keep the charger plugged in, same result.\n\nAll indicator lights were on and the fans were spinning full speed. I don't have an external monitor nor a cable to test if it's the screen itself (but I'm pretty sure it isn't).\n\nLenovo's NOVO button did not help since there were no display.\n\nI've also attached some media so you can see for yourself - image in comment.\n\nIt's already been several hours at this point and I'm out of ideas what to do, any helps would be greatly appreciated, thank you!!!",

  "Black Friday buying advice This post is for anyone looking to buy a laptop that is at least 1 tier above trash, with info on CAD, gaming, general use and more. I edit this several times a day.\n\nI have created a subreddit dedicated to helping people with tech. Check it out at r/TOOsTechTactics\n\nPlease go here for updated guide. https://www.reddit.com/r/TOOsTechTactics/s/wMiIvI1fDA\nThis post is a little bit of a mess, and it will not be updated anymore. Seriously, if you see this, go to the updated one.\n\nConsidering how well I feel like this post did, I will create a similar post for next year, hopefully with a more intuitive format and more information. Links to all my favorite experts as well. \n\nThis is an informative post not an English lesson.\n\nTo start, laptops come in a huge variety of types and form factors and sizes and specs. There is a huge market for laptops and many people are overwhelmed with their choices. This post will help you choose a laptop with decent specs, however it will not be indicative of things like build quality and warranty. Let's make a few things very clear right off the bat.\n\n1. Use caution when buying anything online.\n2. Never buy from Temu. Among many reasons for that, Temu is China. Literally just China.\n3. Laptops are expensive. Sorry.\n4. One brand can have great super high end laptops and at the same time try to sell you e-waste like it's a bargain. This is why I cannot recommend certain brands. That's a whole book's worth of information.\n5. There is no perfect universal laptop.\n6. Ask a question I haven't addressed here and if I deem it worthy I will post info about it here.\n7. I want to hear if you got a good laptop based on this post, please and thank you. This is to improve my future posts.\n8. If you are nervous about buying online, try going to a Best Buy. That's an (American Big Box Tech Retailer) tech store. Do be aware that they will try to sell you a computer like a car dealer tries to sell you a car. They will help you. If they don't, well...\n9. If you want to ask anyone for tech advice, you gotta realize that it is work. It's work. There is no secret formula to get you the perfect device.\n10. Specs are one thing, but build quality and actual performance are another. Some laptops will break really easily. Some 5KUSD laptops break easily because they use plastic hinges. Acknowledge that not every tech person has handled and used for 5 years every laptop that has come out of the market. We cannot predict failures such as these. \n11. If you ask me for any advice, take it with this in mind. I will do my best, and I will tell you if something is wildly overpriced, or a scam, or not good enough. However, I would rather you overpay for a great laptop than not have a good enough laptop. \n12. As per expert and enthusiast recommendation, batteries should be replaced around every two years, because all lithium ion batteries will degrade in health and capacity over time. You can alleviate, but in no way prevent this decline by keeping your battery temperature at an acceptable level. Among other things, that is the most simple. Battery replacement can be delayed, but you risk battery expansion (look up spicy pillow syndrome, severe cases can destroy your device, either by chemical or physical means.) and you will live with reduced capacity over time.\n13. If your laptop is slow and clunky, there are some simple things you can do to speed it up yourself. Free things you can do, uninstall programs you do not use, and disable startup programs you do not use. This will free up system resources. You can easily look up how to do this faster than I can type out a reply of: go look it up yourself. You can also clean out your laptop. This is done by opening up your laptop and cleaning away dust and debris. This is especially important with laptops that have a fan intake for cooling. These can get dirty very quickly. The next thing that you can do is shop online for thermal paste. What you can do is you can repaste the chips on your CPU and GPU. The paste I use is Artic MX 4, and it costs around $4-12USD. Very good price. You will find that your computer may already have paste, but it could be old and failing, making your computer overheat. Temperature control is extremely important for computers. You would find it preferable to have your computer reach its maximum performance before it reaches its maximum temperature. You can look up a how to video online to find a step by step video guide on how to repaste your computer. Make sure to include your specific model in your search results. The last thing that you can do, and is also most expensive, is replace your HDD and your RAM. If your laptop has 4GB 8GB of RAM, consider buying an upgrade. Look up your computer model and find the type of RAM it uses. Then buy a lot of comparable RAM that has a higher capacity than what you already have. Don't ask me how to do it, just look it up. If your laptop has a hard drive (HDD), it is likely slowing down your computer a lot. You can purchase a SATA SSD for 20x to 200x faster speeds than HDD. This does not mean your computer will be 20x to 200x faster, but it will surely be a noticeable improvement. This will require purchasing an SATA SSD that matches the size you require, and then also buying a SATA to USB converter. You will then have to download a specialized program to clone your HDD to your SSD. This is a complicated process, but it is worth it for those who want to save a buck. This requires much research and patience. If you don't want to do any of this, or your laptop is simply a potato anyways, then it is time to buy a new laptop. Believe it or not, every laptop has a time where it is wholly inadequate.\n\nWith that out of the way here is information:\n\nAs you read, you will find scattered segments on different topics. Make sure you skim through and make sure something you may want to read about is typed about. \n\nMy friend, if you are wanting to buy a laptop that will last more than 2 years, you will need to spend at least $400USD. Add $100USD for each year. If you are not an experienced buyer, this is a good rule of thumb. Make sure that the laptop can have its battery replaced, as they should be replaced every 2 years.\n\nAs you read this, you will find more information, but this is my general spec advice when purchasing any laptop meant to last at least 2 years and perform optimally.\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5 11th Generation up, Intel Core Ultra 5 up, or Ryzen 5 5600X and up (I am not familiar with Ryzen Processors)\nGPU: (for gamers and professional users) NVIDIA RTX 3070 up.\nRAM: 24GB or more type DDR4 or DDR5 and up. LPDDR is essentially the name for RAM for laptops. \n\nThose are my recommendations for decently spec'd laptop. \n\nCompare two laptops? There is stuff out there. You can test specific parts using UserBenchmark.com or even the whole computer in the same place. Do note that many enthusiasts will stand behind Userbenchmark and others hate it. Alternatives are CPUMark for CPU's, 3DMark for Graphics cards, and Notebookcheck for the more advanced user with the tradeoff of more accurate data.) This only shows data of people testing your exact same computer, it isn't predictive. Take it with a grain of salt. Should not be your primary method of making a purchase decision.\n\nIntel Core i3's are the lowest tier of Intel Core.\nIntel Core i9's are the highest tier, but you don't need an i9 unless you are doing serious heavy lifting with your laptop or any computer.\nAn Intel Core i3 14th Gen can easily beat out a core i9 5th Gen. Generation matters so much when it comes to Intel CPU's.\nIntel Core Ultras are slightly less powerful than Intel Cores, but more efficient. They are also a new technology. \nSnapdragon X or Snapdragon Elite processors are basically really supe'd up mobile phone processors. Very efficient. Still decently powerful. Any Intel Core Ultra or Snapdragon processor is going to be a decent if not great processor. (For those interested in snapdragon processors, please see my segment on it)\nCore Ultra's naming scheme is alot like Intel Core naming scheme. Intel Core Ultra 9 is the most powerful, with Intel Core Ultra 5 being lowest tier (Intel Core i3 is lowest tier for Intel Core Processors). Intel Core Ultra and Intel Core have a difference, but the Ultra in Intel Core Ultra does not mean that they are better than Intel Core. Intel Core Ultra processors are a new type of processor that is less powerful than an Intel Core with the benefit of higher efficiency. It also seems that Intel Core Ultra is to be found with \"AI\" laptops. Intel Core uses more power, but is more powerful. Intel Core Ultra is just a different and newer architecture of processor, but just because it is new does not mean it is inherently better. It is important to note that the Core Ultra Processors manage to have a huge advantage over Intel Core Processors with the sheer efficiency.\nIntel Celeron's are the basic of basic processors. New Celeron's are actually pretty decent, but they are not nearly as good as even an i3. If you see an ad for a Celeron, don't buy unless you want the bare minimum. Just don't. Pentium is slightly better than Celeron, the tier above. Same book as Celeron, just don't. \n\nBelow is some really complex information on the naming scheme of Intel Processors. This can help for fine tuning a decision. You don't have to know this, but it can help. Feel free to scroll past this if you need to.\n\nThe naming schemes of CPU's are created to be as specific as possible, and at a glance an enthusiast can identify the processor, but it is confusing for the general consumer. Let's start with Intel Core Ultra processors.\nLet’s take the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, for example:\nThe ‘Core Ultra’ is the processor’s name.\nThe ‘7’ represents the brand level, indicating the processor’s performance tier. Other tiers include 5, and 9. The higher the brand level, the more powerful and capable the CPU is.\nThe ‘1’ shows the processor series. As new series are released, this number will go up, like in the Intel Core Ultra 9 288V, where the ‘2’ represents a newer series.\nThe ’55’ is the SKU, which isnt important for the everyday consumer.\nThe suffix ‘H’ indicates the processor type, with the H-series focused on high performance for laptops. Likewise, if you see the suffix ‘U’, it means it’s a power-efficient chipset. This applies to Intel Core as well.\nFor Intel Core Processors:\nCore i7-14650HX as an example.\nThe ‘i7’ is the tier indicator. i3 to i9.\nThe ’14’ indicates the generation of the processor. So, ’14’ signifies a 14th Gen processor. Similarly, ’13’ or ’12’ would denote the 13th or 12th Gen processors, respectively.\nThe ‘650’ is the SKU, which isn't important for the everyday consumer.\nThe ‘HX’ suffix indicates the sub performance of the Processor. A \"U\" designation means it's a \"mobile\" chip, meaning less powerful but more efficient.\n\nA little bit more hard to digest information, I promise it gets easier. \n\nSuffix\tMeaning for the letters you will see on the end of some CPU processors for laptops.\nHX\tHigh-end gaming or workstation laptops where maximum performance and multitasking are essential. Keep this one cool, or your going to cook your laptop.\nHK\tFor gaming laptops, unlocked for easy overclocking, which means shoving more power into your CPU to make it perform faster than it's Base level. While this isn't inherently dangerous, you need to keep the processor cool to do this, and it can reduce the lifespan of the CPU, which is going to be far longer than the rest of the laptop anyways.\nH\tHigh-performance laptops for gaming, content creation, or heavy multitasking.\nU\tPower-efficient chips for everyday tasks like web browsing or productivity, designed for long battery life. \n\nGPU's are just as important as CPU's if you want to use your laptop for media creation, gaming, and creation software that is used professionally and not casually. This includes CAD software like Autodesk Inventor, Blender, etc. \nMost popular GPU's on market are NVIDIA GPU's\n3050 minimum.\n4090, you are just being overkill. \n30, 40 is the generation.\n50, 90 is the tier.\nAs a side note, NVIDIA 50 series GPU's are on their way, so make sure to keep an eye out if you are interested.\nDon't expect any gaming or graphically intensive processing without a dGPU, that means a GPU separate from the ones that are built into CPU's. \n\nRAM is going to be the second most important item for general performance other than the CPU, unless you are a gamer and have a GPU. RAM is your computers short term memory. It really needs this so that things run quickly and smoothly. 16GB of RAM is decent, even great today. But in a year, it may not be so. I suggest a 24GB RAM minimum. 32GB is going to be a more common option though. If you absolutely cannot afford the 32GB option, don't panic, but realize that you may get hurt from it down the road.\nIt is important to note that your RAM is the single biggest determining factor in the lifespan of your laptop. The more RAM, the longer it will last (basically). If your computer starts acting choppy or slow, it could be a RAM issue.\n\nAs of current, an NPU (of what makes an AI chips so special) is (to my understanding) a bit of a marketing thing. They do have real use, but it's not anything your GPU cannot do. Industry is planning on having computers natively compute AI tasks, and that is what the NPU is for. Thing is that those chips are the absolute bare minimum, and the reason why is that we have no actual application made for them, yet.\n\nIf you go on Reddit asking me or anyone else to look at a prospective buy, you gotta realize 3 things. 1, we are not wizards. There is no secret formula. 2. We need details. What do you use it for, what games, photos? Every single detail. You got kids? Will it be treated nicely? Every single detail. 3, I can speak for all tech people that we have never tested every single laptop in existence. Some 2-3,000USD laptops suffer from poor build quality. That's real. And the truth is the industry as a whole actually really wants your money. I can only recommend based on specs, but not build quality. As far as I know, Apple products and Microsoft Surface products are the two suppliers where I can confidently say that you will get a premium build quality (almost) every single time, however these devices are also extremely difficult and expensive to repair.\n\nI suggest at least an 8th Gen Intel Core i5 (i5-8200 for example) with at with 12GB RAM as the bare minimum. For more than 2 years, I recommend at least 12th Generation Intel i5 (i5-12200 or similar) and at least 24GB RAM. Intel's latest Generation of Core CPU's are 14th generation. Those are solid chips. Intel Core Ultras are also really good, but you trade the raw power of Intel Cores for more efficiency. AMD chips are not as common on laptops as Intel Chips are, but do not underestimate AMD. Getting an Intel Core i9 anything is overkill. Even for the best of gamers, Intel Core i7 is just fine. Unless you are doing engineering work or have a computer that requires extreme processing power, not gaming power, but processing power, then you get an Intel Core i9. 256GB of storage is just fine unless you want to store your photos and videos on it. 512GB up depending on how much you want to put on it. Another thing to look out for is SSD vs HDD. You can often get more storage with a HDD, but an SSD is so much faster. Also, once your computer shoots it's last electrical pulse, and it will someday, all you have to do to get all your photos back is to take the SSD and have someone clone it. Basically take it to your local computer repair shop, and if you know what you are doing, you can DIY it (if you know what you are doing). In the case of an HDD failure, you may have to spend thousands to get your data back. It's a spinning disk (HDD) vs (in really basic terms) a super fast USB stick or super fast phone storage (SSD). \n\nIt is important to note the difference between RAM and Storage. \nRAM often comes in configurations like 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, and as stated above, is important for doing tasks quickly. Storage on the other hand, requires a part called an SSD (Solid State Drive)(Modern laptops should not have an HDD - Hard Disk Drive - because they are much slower. However, they are supreme in the amount of storage they can hold. You can buy 24TB HDD off the market. Data hoarder?) an SSD that you find in a laptop will typically have configurations of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB. One TB (Terabyte) is equal to about 1024GB (Gigabytes). KB<MB<GB<TB<PB<YB<whytheheckdoyouneedthatmuchstorage Your SSD will hold things like Photos, videos, games, and more. \n\nI am sorry that the market is confusing, it really is. You don't understand the difference, and that's normal, and that's not ok. Kudos to you for reaching out. I highly suggest AGAINST buying from an online retailer unless it is specifically from the brand you are buying from. No refurbished laptops online, big no no, especially if not from 1st party. Often 3rd party sellers buy defective parts for cheap and then slap together a laptop and sell it. You can get a real actual working computer that meets your specs, except it isn't a laptop because the charging mechanism is broken. Don't buy from 3rd parties online. Don't! I have discovered that going to your local computer repair shop is a fairly safe option for buying a decent computer. They can sell refurbished computers, but this time each one has had a specific time dedicated to it. Even going to Best Buy, you are more likely to overpay for a great laptop than you are likely to overpay for a crappy laptop. If you buy on Amazon or online at all, no third party retailers even if the price is 200USD cheaper. You will lose out on something every time. Also make sure the seller is in your region. Let's say you live in USA Asus sold you a nice laptop at a nice price. 2 months later it dies on you. You go to Asus for the warranty. Well. You bought your laptop from  ASUS Germany which serves, idk, Europe. They won't give you the warranty because you live in the US. This has happened before folks and will continue to happen. Buy from the correct region.\n\nElectronics are expensive, if you buy a cheap price of crap, can you really expect it to work like a premium item? \n\nDo not buy Chromebooks unless you specifically know what it is. Chromebooks seem appealing and are very cheap, and the battery life is really good. However, there is a reason the battery life is so good. The stuff inside it is so weak, it needs so little power, that that battery lasts forever. It's not as bad as having wait times so high it negates the long battery life, but you are still sacrificing performance. I have also discovered that Chromebooks are very limited in compatibility. The apps that you use on your Windows computer sometimes cannot be used on Chromebook. Is there a fix? Probably not one that someone needs help buying a laptop can do. ChromeOS is a flavor of Linux Debian, which is another way of saying it's closer to a crappy, not well made android phone than it is Windows, which is highly polished with wide compatibility. That being said, Chromebooks so have a use. They are awesome low end devices. Anything to be done in a browser can be done in a Chromebook, just don't expect much performance from it. I say this because I myself have a Chromebook, and multiple windows devices. Chromebook is gr8 if you are an android person. Also Chromebook is natively Linux, if you are that kind of person who would want to know that.\n\nWindows is terrible with low end devices. Chromebook was created for them.\n\nYou think a MacBook or an Apple computer will suit your needs better than a Windows or Chromebook? Never buy the baseline. Ever. Always go at least 1 tier above the baseline. It's an expensive bullet to bite, but it won't be more expensive than buying an underpowered laptop. 16GB RAM is actually fine with MacOS because it's built differently from windows. However, never expect to do any heavy lifting with a MacOS system unless you pay several thousand USD for a ridiculously locked down device (see upgrading your SSD for new Mac pros that cost a black market heart). What you gain with Mac is the Apple ecosystem, which is honestly great for the average consumer, and you lose on performance and compatibility, along with customization. You can also get locked out of switching to windows, its just more difficult to switch back, files etc. I will say again, never buy the baseline Apple Product, and remember that you will not be able to upgrade it.\n\nI've seen lots of computers and laptops that say starting at x price and the starting at is absolutely terrible. Look above for your minimums. Do they meet?\n\nSame with buying any cheap laptop. Business knows you don't know what you are buying. If you see anything 4GB or 8GB RAM, STAY AWAY!\n\nYou may see on your listing for a laptop that a battery will last 12 hours. If you look closer you will notice an asterisk. Usually, a manufacturer will place a laptop in \"optimal\" conditions and measure battery life under that. Never expect your laptop to reach an advertised battery life.\n\nSnapdragon processors:\nSnapdragon processors are not the new kids on the block. They have silently been sitting in phones for a while now, but recently, they have appeared in laptops as extremely efficient processors. (Important side note here, AMD has come out with its own line of extremely efficient processors, but they can't compare in price, and that is why the Snapdragon processor shines. More on those coming soon.) Snapdragon processors are based off of a different architecture, and so lots of compatibility issues can arise. Expect most video games to not work, so don't get for your kid. You can expect anything that you do in a browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, TOR) to work very well. You may very well go several days with hours on hours of use to go by without the need to charge. This is perfect for people who only use stuff like browsers. They are also often cheaper, but you can fill in that cheap price with nice things like an OLED display or more RAM. They tend to be very light as well. In essence, snapdragon processors are perfect for those that use things like YouTube and Facebook alot, as you access those through your browser. There have been some issues that have come up with snapdragon computers, and this is because they are a new tech. Any new tech has issues. (Self driving cars, first phones, first computers, AI) And any issues are being smoothed out and will continue to get better. If this sounds good but you want to avoid any issues, you can always wait for the next generation of snapdragon processors to come out. The specialists that work on the creation of the processors will have gathered data on issues and fixed many of them by then. No games. Exceptional for browser usage, better than MacBook battery life.\nOn that note, experts have compared a Snapdragon laptop as a laptop that has better battery life and can do more. (Sick burn) While the Snapdragon processor has some compatibility issues, it is still a Windows machine, which is so much more compatible than laptops that have MacOS.\n\nIf you want a real laptop, start with Business class laptops or laptops aimed at businesses. There are many many alternatives, but one name brand business grade laptop that is reputable are the Dell Latitudes, and another is HP Envy, and another is Lenovo ThinkPads. They can be expensive, but it's a very decent system. For the average consumer, they are a good option. Business class laptops are really good buys, because generally, a business will make a deal with a company, say Dell. Dell wants to keep their contract with this business. To make sure that the business does not switch to Lenovo, they have to make a laptop that will not break down and is easy to fix. Business class laptops also tend to have more documentation and manuals available. The business wants good computers that don't break down, and Dell wants to keep its contract. Thus, the business class laptop is born.\n\nGaming laptop for your kid? Anything less than $600USD is a waste of your time. Expect to spend $800USD. If it doesn't have a discreet graphics card, don't buy it. (For serious gamers only)\n\nIf you are looking to buy a laptop with an Intel Core i7 12th generation and are buying it for your kid to play Roblox, it will be just fine. Same with Minecraft Bedrock or Java Edition. Fortnite, on the edge, anything more sophisticated, and your computer will likely struggle.\n\nFor those not knowing difference between Minecraft Java and Minecraft Bedrock, Because Minecraft is hands down, yes you too conservative grandpa, Minecraft is one of the most if not the most influential game of all time, (this is my personal opinion). Minecraft Java Edition is more CPU intensive, needing better CPU, but is also less microtransactions, more moddable, and has your kids Favorite servers (2B2T for that concerning kid). Bedrock still has popular servers (you will get all those mini games like PVP and bed wars) but is more compatible, playable on phone, PC, and console. I prefer Java, but that's my personal brew. \n\nIf you want a laptop for your kid to play games on like Roblox, Minecraft, or Fortnite, you will need to spend at least $500 for an Awesome Parent Worthy gaming experience. \n\nSome good gaming laptop brands: Acer Nitros, ROG Zephyrus, and Lenovo Legions, and MSI.\n\nSpeaking of Gaming, ever heard of a Nintendo switch? The handheld one? Well, imagine that, but it's a windows computer instead. Now imagine that exists. Now stop, because it does. Unfortunately, I am very poor, but if I was granted a wish, I would get the ASUS ROG ALLY X (yes caps needed). It's a super powerful handheld machine for around $800 ($700USD Back Friday). Yeah, it's expensive. It's older brother, the ROG ALLY is going for around $500. It's a neat machine, and you can hook a monitor up to them and definitely use it as a gaming rig or workstation. Alternatives are currently the MSI CLAW or Lenovo Legion Go. For gamers, another alternative is the SteamDeck and the SteamDeck OLED. Very good machines, as in AAA games good machines, take a look if you are interested. Maybe it's just got a gold filter over it with me, but I think it's freaking cool.\n\nFor those looking for serious gaming laptops, try looking for an at least Intel Core i7 12th Generation with an H or HX or K at the end of the CPU model name. These letters indicate the performance. Also recommend at least a NVIDIA RTX 4080 or equivalent as very high performance. You really don't need more than 60FPS for biological reasons, but 120Hz is where your brain basically caps out. 240hz is another very small increment of improvemenr, but not a lot. I suggest a minimum of 32GB of RAM.\n\nFramework is a relatively new company that specializes is extremely customizable laptops, and you can easily buy one framework laptop and have it last as long as you want because you can simply replace the parts. If you are willing to pay extra for great laptop, with customizability, look no further than framework. Before you ask me what to get, how about you do an internet search first. \n\nFor people just looking for a laptop with a really nice display, OLED displays are widely regarded as absolutely beautiful. The blacks are truly black, and that makes for a world of difference in regards to contrast. They can suck extra battery though.\n\nFor those looking for content creation laptops, if you draw or create videos regularly, you should look into an external storage device, particularly an SSD for that durability. I personally have a Samsung T7 and I love it. However you may find others at better prices. Keep in mind that so many listings are scams, it's mindblowing. There are many \"2 in 1\" laptops that people seem to like. Go find one if you need one.\n\nFor those looking for laptops used for coding, you will want a laptop with a decent CPU. For great performance I suggest an Intel Core i7 at least 11th Generation, or an Intel Core Ultra 7.\n\nFor those going into day trading, I suggest a gaming laptop or similar. If you need fast response times from your computer, you need a powerful laptop, because those milliseconds matter. Also consider getting an Ethernet port for direct connection to your router. This eliminates any instability that can occur with Wi-Fi, especially if you live in a crowded area or have many devices.\n\nPeople have asked if Intel 13th Generation processors have issues. They did at one point. In technical terms processors had a fault in their microcode algorithm that saw them request elevated operating voltages from the motherboard. That can cause instability because too high a voltage can wear chips like these out with time. Basically they were misbehaving. Intel and it's partners have fixes this by releasing BIOS updates, so if you have an issue, update your computer. The problem is largely resolved.\n\nI just typed this out, but it didn't save. Ugh!\nIt is important to know the difference between Windows Pro and Windows Home. Often, you will feel that with Windows Pro, you will get a better product. There is one large thing that is relevant to the consumer that you get with Windows Pro. Bitlocker (more on that soon). With Windows Pro, you get the ability to use Microsoft Remote Desktop. A remote desktop allows you to use a computer you own like you are sitting next to it. For example, let's say I am at work, 50 miles away from my desktop at home. With Windows 10 Pro on my desktop, and Home on my laptop, I can log into my computer at home (assuming it is on and set up) and then I can control my home desktop as if I was there. Super cool. Microsoft remote desktop works best (extra config needed if outside home) inside your own network. This basically means you have to be inside the same wifi, home, apartment, building to use  Microsoft Remote Desktop. Alternatives that are also free that I use is Chrome Remote Desktop, and Parsec, and those do not require windows Pro. I can control my computer from anywhere with these. Remember to never give people access to remote desktop on your computer unless you know them. Scammers do this often to steal your money and data. Other features of Windows Pro are better ability to control systems (IT for school or business) and overall many features that are useful for business. I do not remember each and every one because those that I do not remember were not important enough for me to remember. \n\nAnother large feature of Windows Pro that is actually useful to you is BitLocker. Bitlocker is a program that runs on your computer all the time to encrypt all do your data. Your computer is the only computer that can read this data. This encryption is so hard to crack, that the United States Government would have a very difficult (not impossible) time of decrypting your data. Bitlocker will protect your data, but not your device. If your device gets stolen, nobody can read your data (government documents, corporate emails, etc.) If your device gets stolen, you lose the device and data, but whoever stole the device gets only the device, not the data. Because your device is the only computer that can read your data, if your laptop breaks and you want to get the photos off of your SSD, it will be basically impossible to get your data back. It is encrypted and gone. Bitlocker is often enabled by default on windows pro devices. This means that if you forget your password and you have a windows pro devices, you are probably very very screwed. I highly recommend to learn how to get and retrieve your blocker encryption key, this is a 25 character password. I suggest you make physical copies, take photos and also keep a copy where you keep documents such as birth certificates and passports. If you do not want Bitlocker, you can turn it off. Basically your computer will take a minute to decrypt your drive and you won't lose anything, it just removes the encryption and makes it so no encryption will happen in the future. Normal retrievable files and data. I suggest this if you are not worried about having your data stolen, but are worried about accidentally making it completely unretrieveable. \n\nSystems with higher Specs are going to tend to have lower battery life and higher temperatures. This is normal. However, in my opinion, the low battery life can be attributed to the 100WHr limit on batteries, as it is hard to transport these high power density batteries due to regulation. Manufacturers also neglect to meet this line, with some laptops having 86WHr or 56WHr batteries.\n\nA commenter (Intrepid_Passage_692) on this thread and an obvious to me fellow enthusiast also pointed out some great things which I will share here in their own words. ---\"the difference between a 100 and 200 dollar laptop is insane. 400 is the next jump, then 800, then 1200. Laptops get AMAZING once you spend over 1200 bucks. Past 2k is the land of diminishing returns, at that point buy what you want.\" ---\n(USD assumed, 2k means 2,000USD, a buck is a slang term for a dollar.)---\n\"just get core ultra. They significantly outperform core chips up to ~80-100W. At that point, no one worrying about sub 2k laptops will even be able to afford a chassis that can contain a chip going over 100W without thermal throttling. I have to use a watercooled laptop to tame the 14900hx. I am looking forward to core ultra, even if it means I lose 20% performance at *checks notes* 210W...\"---\n(W means Watts. A laptop drawing 60 watts for an hour will draw 60Whr (Watt Hours) from a battery., 2k means 2,000USD, 14900hx is 14900HX, a 14th Gen Intel Core Processor that is Top of the line, thermal throttling is a term used to describe when your computer reaches its maximum temperature before it reaches its maximum performance, water-cooling is a form of laptop cooling that involves water. Works like a car engine cooling system, with cooling fluid being pumped from the engine to a radiator and back. I disagree with Intrepid the discarding of the Intel Core Series. I feel that if the differences were that high, I would hear more noise about it. I am currently and always looking into it.)\n\n\nFor anyone who made it this far, know that my prices are high bars with padding so that people who do the bare minimum of research can just go buy a laptop priced at $500 and actually get a decent device. (For consumers, if you read the last sentence and decided to take off $100USD from your budget based on that, I highly recommend you retract that decision). I myself got a used $600USD laptop for $350USD and I can do pretty much anything with it. The difference between experienced users and everyday consumers is that they don't know how to get great laptops at great prices. That is why this subreddit exists.\n\n\nFun facts that you can skip through:\n1. lithium ion batteries should be replaced every two years\n2. SSD's have a lifespan, this is measured in TBW (TeraBytes Written) it is unlikely you will reach the end of a SSD lifespan.\n3. Snapdragon Processors are found in mobile phones.\n4. Minecraft, especially Java Edition, is more CPU intensive than GPU intensive.\n5. When a SSD writes it's last byte, it tells the computer it cannot be written to anymore, this makes the computer angry. You can restore the data by simply reading it. Take it to a local repair shop. HDD require a much more expensive fix, as they have moving parts that have physically worn out.\n6. Data written on mediums such as CD's (Compact Disks), DVD's (Digital Video Disk's), HDD's, SSD's and more have a lifespan? Data can disappear over time. If you have a 20 year old CD with a song on it laying around, well you don't. \n7. Lenovo is actually in part owned by the PRC. However, the way it's business is structured and the fact they don't sell completely custom parts, means that even the United States government trusts Lenovo to provide them with Servers and server equipment.\n8. Snapdragon mobile processors are popular in high end phones. The new processors you find in laptops are tweaked so they consume more power and put out more performance, but they use the same architecture.\n9. In 2005, AMD's Athlon 64 FX-57 was overclocked to 10 GHz using liquid helium cooling. Breaking 10GHz was a significant achievement at the time, but it required extreme cooling conditions and was not a commercially available product.\n10. A CPU's GHz does not equal performance. Like other computer things, many variables are involved.\n\n\nI specifically did not mention AMD Ryzen because I do not know the AMD Ryzen naming scheme like I do Intel naming Scheme.\n\nFor fellow enthusiasts, if I get something wrong or leave something out, please leave a comment so I can address it, I will not be offended. \n\nI put lots of love into this guide, and I appreciate hearing back from you to find out if it helped, although you are under no obligation to do so. I do not do this for money.\n\nPersonally, as one may be curious to know, I recently decided to temporarily go broke and I got myself an ASUS ROG ALLY X.\n\nThank you for reading, if you feel the need, remember to stay posted as I update this guide very frequently. Next year this guide will be deprecated as I am planning on making a new and improved guide available next year.\n\nVery recently, have created a new Subreddit where I will create guides like this. It is very new. Go to r/TOOsTechTactics and you will find it. I have always wanted to do something like this, your feedback and time have given me the push to start.\n\nIf you have read to this point and would like to see the 2025 guide, basically this guide but updated, please go here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TOOsTechTactics/s/Qw88cYk4GQ\n\n-An experienced person who has made lots of mistakes and learned from them.",

  "Second post in this thread, first of all, great post!!\nTo get into Amd is not hard and very mich rewarding since they make very good laptop cpu's. Most people would even say, better then intel on the last 2-3 generations.\n\nAllow me to extend your post with this info:\n\n\nAmd ryzen laptop cpu:\n\nExample: Ryzen 7840HS:\n\nJust like intel the first number is the gen: in this case 7\n\nJust like intel has the i3, i5, i7 and i9 tier, Amd has Ryzen 3,5,7,9 tier.\nLook at the second number, here 8 means it's a ryzen 9 (higher then 7).\nthe 40 is subsequent tier number.\n\nThe suffix, here 'HS' indiquates the power/hear target. HS is the highest (for enthousiasts). Look online for other suffixes.\n\n\nThen current gen:\n\nJust like Intel (I feel a pattern here) AMD decided to screw the naming schemes and call their cpu's 'Ryzen AI 9 370' Which basically says it's Ai-ready, which only means they have NPU core, it's expressed in TOPS (google the acronym). The current tier is 360, 365, 370 and 375, I'm sure more will come. They first had an exclusivity contract with Asus, that's why most HX 3xx cpu-powered laptops are from asus but lenovo, hp and other brands are starting to offer them as well.\nThose new cpu's are very much focussed on efficiency, just like the new ultra intel cpu's, and good iGpu.",

  "I think 500$ laptops are not enough for roblox/minecraft games cuz, i got a \"gaming\" laptop with GTX 1650 ti and i5 10300h and it's not really good cuz sometimes it just freezes in games. I usually play roblox and get ~50-70 fps avg. Yk for gaming laptop should not go down 60fps cuz its very terrible for eyes.

  "I could use some help. I am looking to buy a new pc, and i will need it to last me a few years, as i will use it for school and probably wont be able to afford a new one as a student. I will obviously be using it mostly for school, more specifically i will be majoring in law. So no crazy applications or tools will be needed. I dont really play video games too much, but will play the occasional civilizations 6 and 7 (when it comes out). Not the most demanding game and i dont mind having to lower the graphics a bit if i need to for it to run smoothly. Therefore im fairly certain that i wont need more than 256GB storage. \n\nI was also thinking 16GB RAM would be enough, but now im not sure. My only problem is that in my price range there arent a lot of computers available with more RAM from what i can see. I was looking at the Macbook 13” M3 16/256, just for the quality and battery life, but if there are better options with perhaps more RAM (if you think i’ll need it) i would love to know. I am from Denmark, so my prices might sound a little steep compared to what i can see on other forums. I can get the MacBook for 1200$, which might sound like a bad deal for people in the us, but everything is more expensive here so. \n\nPlease note that since im from Denmark most American websites like bestbuy or american amazon is either not useable or will come with some hefty taxes, so im not looking for specific deals, but more just a hint to certain models. I was also looking at the Lenovo Yoga 7i gen 9, but i dont think thats better unless i could get 32GB RAM for a similar price to the MacBook, but please let me know if it is.\n\nI dont know if i’ve just written a bunch of useless stuff, but i hope it gives an insight to my situation and needs, and i would be extremely happy if anyone would be willing to provide some insight",

  "Hello !  \nThank you for this great post.\n\nIn advance sorry for my english as it is not my main language.  \nI am myself in search for a laptop.  \nConsidering that i used to have the macbook pro (mid 2015) that died on me I am in need for a new computer.  \nAs I am an architect i'm looking for a laptop that could manage Autocad/Enscape/Sketchup/Revit and the Adobe suite (maybe a little photoshop AI) smoothly but not planning on doing 3Ds or big rendering. I don't play either on my laptop, or at most indie small stuff. For the rest, classic internet use and i watch movies on it (so i'd like a screen that is kinf of suited for that also)  \nI have to say I'm used to Apple design so i would like a laptop that is nicely finished and not a 3kg gamer laptop with neon lights.  \nPrice range would be from 1200 to 1800 euros, could go higher if its definitly worth it.  \nAnd mostly a laptop that lasts at least 5 years given the price..\n\nI wanted to go for the Asus Zenbook 14 (or S 14) :  \nProcesseur Intel Core Ultra 7 - Puce graphique Intel ARC -32 RAM  \nThat goes for around 1300 for blackfriday, bur read that for architectural work i should go for an NVIDIA RTX and that the intel ARC is not great, there is the 15' version with AMD Ryzen 7 and AMD Radeon but I don't know what its worth (1299 euros)\n\nSo maybe the zenbook pro 14 :  \nIntel® Core™ i9-13900H NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4060 (233 AI TOPs) 8Go GDDR6  \nBut goes for 1880 euros and i seem to find it only with 16gb RAM that seems to be a little low\n\nThen there is the ProArt with PX 13 and P16, but the first seems to have a too little screen and i'v read that its only 60Hz (event if i don't know how bad that is) and the second may be way too expensive and maybe too big.\n\nAnd at last the Microsoft surface laptop 7 Snap dragon X elite (12core) 32 RAM also at 1880 but i have no idea how this knew tech works with the software i use.\n\nSo I come for help, even if you may know other products that may be better suited ? I can pay a little much but wouldn't want to spend for overkill specs for my use.  \nI am pretty surpised when i read that some recent spec are bad for autocad or architectural design while i used a 2015 laptop for autocad/Rhino during my studies and don't remember struggling that much..",

  "Thank you for this post - it's very helpful!\nI wonder if you (or perhaps another reader on the thread) can comment about build quality (of course nothing is 100% for sure, but still!) and number of cores.\n\nSpecifically, I am looking at two computers:\n\n[Asus Vivobook S 14](https://www.walmart.com/ip/ASUS-Vivobook-S-14-14-WUXGA-OLED-PC-Laptop-Intel-Core-Ultra-7-32GB-RAM-1TB-SSD-Black-S5406/7447569796?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&sourceid=dsn_ad_67b24a3e-8de0-4c6a-a2eb-385363192ede&veh=dsn&wmlspartner=dsn_ad_67b24a3e-8de0-4c6a-a2eb-385363192ede&cn=FY25-Holiday-GIFT-PMax_con_dps_dsn_dis_ad_xcat_s_n&gclsrc=aw.ds&wl9=pla&wl11=online&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA3ZC6BhBaEiwAeqfvymZYDTNdBAzq54K-ePX6-NeGaIbigDYaKaqaltlRMcBxEQsD4hHEBhoCIiwQAvD_BwE)\n\n[Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 11](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx1/thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-11-14-inch-intel/21hm002fus)\n\nWith sales/coupons they end up a similar price (~1000 USD - I know the Lenovo defaults to showing more on that page, but member sales make it really cheap). On paper, the Vivobook's specs are a touch better (slightly newer processor, twice as much storage (terabyte vs. half), larger battery, OLED screen), and otherwise they're pretty much the same.\n\nMy main questions are:\na) do you have thoughts on the processor difference? (Intel Ultra 7 258V vs. Core i7-1365U vPro). Lots of benchmarking sites say that the ultra is performing better, but it also has several fewer cores and I just don't know if that will be an issue in the long run somehow? This is beyond my expertise.\n\nb) What's the catch with the Vivobook/which is a safer bet? The Vivobook is not supposed to be Asus's premium/flagship line, and yet it has amazing specs for very cheap, relatively. Are they known to fall apart? Hinge issues? Something weird? Is the Lenovo a safer bet given that it's from their flagship line? But also I've heard people say their battery life isn't great so maybe it's not?\n\n\n\nI know I can't have it all, but these seem very, very close to it: powerful machines that are nonetheless very light and portable.\nAt this moment they're maybe overkill for my needs - I'm a social sciences researcher so I do a lot of word processing, I make presentations, excel, sometimes R and other research programs, and mostly I often have a lot of programs open at the same time (think word, a reference manager, Spotify, excel, Teams or similar, and multiple browser tabs). I also occasionally watch shows/movies or do very light gaming (when I have time, which currently I don't), but these are much less critical for me. I prioritize performance over storage - I store the largest segments of my data off of my computer anyway.\nBut anyway, I like having computers for a long time and I'm hoping these will last.\n\n\nNo pressure to give feedback - I think I'm just torn between two very good options, and it's hard to go wrong (but also hard to choose)!",
  "Thoughts on these two systems?  Primarily will be using when travelling for emails, web surfing/research, word processing & excel.

  "Thanks for all the time you put into this! I'm looking for a new laptop because mine which I had for 4 and a half years just stopped working. I don't use it for work (have one for that) or gaming, mostly just watching shows on streaming services, YouTube, live sports, etc. and then general stuff like google docs and whatnot. Therefore I do not need anything specific on it, I just want one that will last. Do you have any brand recommendations and a minimum price recommendation for something like that?",
  "First things first, I appreciate the effort you gave to make this post. I agree with your reasoning too, teaching people how navigate computers is better than a random stranger spitballing recommendations online. If I bought a laptop someone recommended me and it underperformed, I’d be pissed. This atleast helps give people a scope to realize you have to shell out some cash for a decent laptop. I have a few criticisms/add ons though.\n\n1) I9 started being produced gen 8, not Gen 5. Doesn’t really matter other than there isn’t a single i3 (i5s push it) that’s better than the og i9-8950hk. (8 year old chip btw) \n\n2) ram should take precedent over cpu at this point. 8GB of ram makes my 14900hx perform like a 10th gen i5 with 32GB of ram. It literally dictates how long your computer will last. If you want to use it for more than 2 years, 16gb minimum. If you have a computer with 8gb of ram and it feel like things run slow or choppy, it’s the ram. \n\n3) If you intend on doing ANY gaming, you need a dgpu. 0 exemptions other than sims 4 and games pre 2014. Even Roblox/minecraft on integrated graphics is a terrible experience ESPECIALLY with 8gb of ram. \n\n4) your 3 paragraphs going in detail about the suffixes of intel chips can be condensed into one because 3/4th of it isn’t applicable anymore. If people are buying chromebooks from 2020 with 9250g’s in them they should’ve read the beginning of your post better. The only laptops with g or y chips are Chinese temu shitbooks\n\n5) the difference between a 100 and 200 dollar laptop is insane. 400 is the next jump, then 800, then 1200. Laptops get AMAZING once you spend over 1200 bucks. Past 2k is the land of diminishing returns, at that point buy what you want.\n\n6) just get core ultra. They significantly outperform core chips up to ~80-100W. At that point, no one worrying about sub 2k laptops will even be able to afford a chassis that can contain a chip going over 100W without thermal throttling. I have to use a watercooled laptop to tame the 14900hx. I am looking forward to core ultra, even if it means I lose 20% performance at *checks notes* 210W…\n\n7) I understand why you recommend userbenchmark but notebookcheck is infinitely better, just harder to navigate. If you want to do one better look up 3d mark or cpumark scores.",

  "So laptops on sale for Black Friday, are the pre sale prices inflated at Best Buy? Probably getting this for my bro for day trading, touch screen was kinda a requirement,\n\n[Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 16\" IPS LED FHD Touch Screen Laptop - Intel Core Ultra 7 with 16GB Memory - 1TB SSD](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sku/6575151.p?skuId=6575151&sb_share_source=PDP)\n\nSays it's on sale for $699 from $1150, so is this actual a $1.1k laptop or a $700 laptop? \n\nAlso if I'm looking for seamless multitasking, switch between programs that have constant changing data/charts, but not graphic intensive, would over 16gb ram just be over kill? \n\nAlso.. probably a important note.. will be connecting and extending 2-3 desktops/monitors to this.\n\nThanks for the information, I did read it all, a lot of info. Mad props for the time and effort!!\n\nAlso if anyone has a suggestion for a laptop that may be a better fit, touch screen is required, not sure if the 16 inch display is, might end up saving a little cash and go with a smaller screen, usually has it hooked up to 3 monitors anyways\n\nThank you again for any more help!!!",

  "Hi, thanks but I disagree with some things.  \n\nI have CDs over 20.  They still play flawlessly.  The data on a CD is expected to last 100 years.  Longer if you keep them from corrosion.  The data is not magnetic and does not rely upon an electrical charge.  Probably lack a player for playback before the disc goes bad.\n\nMy info says most cheap SSDs will last only 5 years or so before they fail.  Maybe longer depending on usage.  Depends on how much you fill it and how many deletes and rewrites you do.  We'll see in a few years I guess. \n\nCPU Ghz does mean performance.  That's why we have overclocking on CPUs and GPUs.   That's part of why a newer i5 can beat an older i7.  Computationally intensive apps like CAD and even Minecraft will benefit from high Ghz CPUs with great single core performance.  Intel CPUs tend to be better in this than AMD ones.\n\nUS Gov trusts all the spies been in it for decades.  Everywhere from Air Force recruits to US Commanders to US Congressmen like Menendez.  Who cares if they trust Lenova - I don't.  No HP, I don't recommend you either.\n\nLi batteries lose capacity over time but they vary and can still hold 80 percent up to 10 years or more.  Depends on usage.  My laptop is still using a 5 year old battery no problem.  It does not last as long, true.  Probably depends on charge/depletion cycles and the quality of the battery, etc.  They should be replaced when you aren't getting enough usage time anymore.  Hopefully car li batteries last more than 2 years... What happens to all these old batteries?  Where are they going?  Are they toxic?  Does anyone care?\n\nHere's my advice:  1. only buy windows 11 pc's now, 2. laptop ram is not upgradable so only buy one with 16 Gb plus now.  Resist the half priced 8 Gb ones if you work on your pc.  3. Opinions vary but I think Intel i7 14700 is still the best bang for the buck if you do CAD, MineCraft etc.  Leave the Core AI CPUs for later when there's actually some useful AI to bother with.  4. Don't let Windows 11 attempt to update your brand new PC's bios.  The AI and CoPilot are just too dumb to do much of anything correctly.\n\nI just returned my GF's new HP laptop.  Thanks Staples for making it easy.  The laptop was really nice with great look and feel to the hardware but Windows 11 tried to update the bios.  One Drive could not even find its own files and folders.  Anivirus not working warning right at first startup - no antivirus activated on brand new HP laptop - not even Windows Defender.  Popup ads galore every startup.  Do research online just to figure out how to disable all the ads popping up and literally filling the screen with ads.  So back it went.  Just as well, it only had 8 GB ram hard installed when MS recommends 16Gb for its Core CPUs. LoL\n\nGuess what HP and DELL are planning on?  Everyone in the entire world that is still on windows 10 is being forced to get a new PC before Oct 2025.  We're talking billions or even trillions of dollars.  Collusion?  Or just a case of when interests coincide?  LoL",

I mostly do mid end gaming, nothing competitive, but I do like to have a couple programs (Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop, pdf viewer, Discord, maybe Blender, or occasionally a CAD program like Revit or ArchiCAD) open. I can happily keep my load a little less, but I'm more concerned the 16GB will be out of date quick. I usually keep it at home, and I don't mind how heavy it is. I plan to buy a cooling pad if I get the higher up one.\n\nI'm not sure why the price difference is so large. Could you/anyone please help me understand the biggest differences function-wise that you see? One has a higher quality Intel processor, the other an older AMD, but is this why the price gap is big? I appreciate it. : ] \n\nEDIT: (Also, I know the $1k option has no iGPU, I'll keep it plugged in while using so I'm not worried about battery life. Just want to know if the $400 price hike is actually worth it. I currently have an old MSI Intel Core i7-8750H with a Nividia 1050 Ti graphics card and 32 GB RAM I got in school 2018. It has always done well, I've loved it, but i need something in between getting a desktop in a few years, so this may be temporary and that's why I'm leaning to get the cheaper option.) \n\n🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼🌻🌼",

  "Ok my friend.\n\nSurface Pros are a nightmare to repair.\nI have heard the laptops are much easier.\nThe reason why this is significant is that in the case you break your laptop, and you take it into the repair shop, the poor guy who tries to help you because you needed it fixed by yesterday can actually fix it. You may not know, but parts are extremely hard to find, for a good price. \nExample, some MacBook pro models require you to buy a new screen when you want to purchase a new battery.\nBatteries should be replaced every two years, as per expert recommendation, as the capacity and health will decline over time. However, this screen battery combo is $600-$800USD, which is insane. And if you don't want to pay that, your only option is to buy aftermarket, and who knows what Chinese warehouse aftermarket is from. I've gotten good parts and bad parts from aftermarket. And then your computer repair guy takes the loss of its not a good part. Screen replacements can cost $100USD to $1000USD. No joke.\nHowever, I recommend at least 24GB of RAM for a laptop that you want to last 2+ years.\nSurface laptop is like buying a MacBook. It's a premium machine. You are paying extra for that premium that comes with the Surface brand name.

  "As of current, an NPU (of what makes an AI chips so special) is (to my understanding) a bit of a marketing thing. They do have real use, but it's not anything your GPU cannot do.

Thing is that those chips are the absolute bare minimum, and the reason why is that we have no actual application made for them, yet.\n\nYou are probably going to want more RAM down the road, upgrade from 16GB.\n\nOption two will be ready for AI if it does come out, because it has a great 4050 GPU. I'd get option 2, it has great specs, and a dGPU. That's basically the biggest thing in its favor following with the i7-14th gen, of which is the best of the best designation with HX, which basically means it's really cool (it can overclock, for enthusiasts only)\nI cannot vouch for build quality, unfortunately.

  "You don't need an iGPU, you want a dGPU. Option 2 has a dGPU. An iGPU is an Integrated Graphics Processing Unit, which means the graphics lives inside of your CPU, it's a mini GPU that isn't sufficient for high end gaming. It's great because it's more efficient and good for basic tasks and light gaming. A dGPU is a Dedicated Graphics Processing Unit. It is it's own chip that is usually much more powerful than an iGPU.

  "Some people say that MacBook's don't need as much RAM as Windows, and I haven't seen any huge issues arise from this. 16GB RAM on Mac is just fine. MacOS is a different operating system from windows, it's built differently. What you gain with Mac is battery life, what you lose is performance and compatibility, however, for your use case it's just fine.\nSorry for not clarifying this, good luck m8.\n\nJust because your from different country doesn't mean I can't give you advice tailored to your situation.

Ultra 7, like an i6.25, and Ultra 5 like an i4.25.",
  "My man, I highly recommend against 8GB of RAM, unless you are comfortable with the performance hit, I strongly recommend against it. Times have changed and 8GB is simply not enough. Feel free to not take my recommendations, but do remember it will come at a cost. It's got a decent i5 12th Gen processor, and it's going to be powerful ish, but the fact that the i5 12th Gen you picked out is mobile, makes it more like a powerful i3 12th Gen. That's still fine with day to day browsing.",
  "Woah. Ok, I cannot recommend on the build quality of any specific computer. That would take hours of my day. Sorry m8.\n\nHowever, I can help with the H and U designation.\nA U processor has better battery life, but much less performance, relative to the chip. The H has more performance, and less battery life, relative to the chip. I'd say (this is a complete guess) a 30 min to 1 hour difference in battery life and 10-30 fram difference. Keep in mind this is a guess based on intuition! \n\nSeeing as how you wanted a laptop with an integrated CPU, I suggest getting a CPU. ;D any laptop with an i5 or Intel Core Ultra has a CPU!\nWhat you will want is to have an H processor with a graphics card like an RTX 3050 like you mentioned for gaming. Have a U processor for a laptop that you take around for school and stuff, if that is what you wanted.",
  "Was it the starting at machine?\n\nFor a Windows machine, 8GB is horrendous. For a Mac, you need about 25% less RAM. Id go with a 16GB model if possible.\nYou won't be able to do any gaming or high demand applications with any Mac, but you get great battery life and the Apple Ecosystem.",

The darks are very dark, you'd just have to see it compared to a backlit display (LED, IPS, LCD)\nIntel Arc Graphics are by no means bad. Intel is making Arc as a direct competitor to NVIDIA and AMD. They have done a really great job even I applaud them. That card will only get better, it is good enough now to suit your needs. If that sounds good to you, I'd go with the Asus Zenbook 14 with the Arc Graphics and Intel Core Ultra 7.\nZenbook pro 14 is a big no. I have no clue why they would build such a beast with an i9 processor and 16GB of RAM, overkill processor, inadequate RAM.\n60Hz refers to the amount of times your display will refresh, like the Frames Per Second in movies or Games. You don't need higher unless you are high end gamer, although these displays with high refresh rates tend to have smoother look and feel, incrementally. You don't need it, is what I am trying to say. 60Hz is just fine.\nFor CAD, the CPU does 60% of the work. Intel Core Ultra 7 will handle it fine.",
  "1, no, it has 8GB RAM. 2 for the same, 3 same reason, but 16GB of RAM, and 4 is also 16GB of RAM. Don't expect any of these to last 4 years simply on the Basis of too little RAM. Aim for 24GB or more.\nThe other specs look good, RAM is the one issue.\nIn other words you could have the exact same machine work, I would recommend the exact same machine if they met the 24GB RAM recommendation.",
  "It's not that much of a difference, thinking relative to your needs now. It's a significant performance difference, but I cannot find a good reason to justify the $40. Acer laptop also seems to be the better deal because of the 1TB SSD and the better battery. However, for web browsing, the size SSD is not a major problem. If you want a laptop that will last anywhere from a little more to maybe extend the life by a year, go for it. It's up to you. \nThe RAM will likely be the biggest determining factor in the lifetime of the laptop. Make sure to consider of the RAM is soldered on either before making a final decision, as of it is soldered, it basically eliminates life support for your laptop.",

It should be fine, just make sure he carries a charger, and 6 hours isn't even bad. Batteries just don't last that long. They test that figure with \"optimal\" conditions, which is usually turning brightness all the way down, turning on power saving and playing a 720p mp3 video. \nIntel Arc Graphics are higher end than Iris, from what I gain. \nIntegrated Arc is just the graphics included in your CPU, CPU:s usually have a mini GPU for display when you don't have a dGPU.",

I can not tell you whether something is a good deal. Prices can vary by region and simple whim, and it is hard to keep track of all that. I would suggest comparing it to similar spec'd items to consider whether it is a good deal.",
  "First thing, 16GB RAM is not overkill, it is too little when the laptop is expected to last two years. you should have at least 24GB of RAM to future proof it. This is especially important considering the amount of screens.\n\nYou need to make sure your computer will support that amount of screens, not just the processor. Some computers are limited to two monitors or three, make sure to check.\n\nFor day trading, I recommend having a laptop with an Ethernet port attached. This model does not seem to have one, but you can buy an Ethernet to USB adapter. Ethernet eliminates Wi-Fi instability. I made a segment in my guide.\n\nI would not be surprised if they made a little change to the price like that, just to get you to buy it. I cannot recommend a fair price, as it varies by region and whim.",

I would suggest specifically looking if your program is supported if you are looking into buying.

  "Hi, I liked your write-up and some good info btw.  As for online info, a lot of variation depending on usage and experiences is what you find.  A lot of people repeat what they read but have no actual experience.  I do sometimes but usually only after I verify with sources I trust.  My laptop is a Dell Latitude with i7, 12Gb, SSD and is too slow for gaming and too small a display for CAD so I use mostly for going online, office apps and 3D print slicer apps.  I can't afford to game on a laptop.  I have a home built desktop, i7 CPU but more ram and GTX video I use for CAD and some Steam games.  I used to use only AMD because it was my preference, maybe due to pricing, but I do CAD probably more than gaming so I look for high ghz single core performance and that's usually intel.  \n\nIMO for gaming you can't beat a console.  Xbox or Playstation - at $500 its a steal compared with building a gaming PC and keeping it updated every couple of years so you can keep playing the current titles.  Let's see, should I spend $350 on a new CPU, $200 on a new board, $500 on a new video card and $70 on some more RAM and make due with my SSD for now or maybe get a Series X 1TB no-disc version for $399 plus $60 a year?  I actually prefer the console gaming experience but I have to keep my PC upgraded for CAD so I end up doing both every few years.",

  "OP this is an AMAZING post and I can't tell you how much I appreciate you writing it and taking the time to comment.  I've been using refurbished laptops that break after a year for the last few years and I'm done with that mess because it's a huge headache when they fail.  I'm considering taking the risk on a Nimo cyber monday deal (that's the brand that the other commenter linked above).  The 16 ram and 1tb is on sale for $299 and the same specs but 32 ram is on sale for $379.  In your opinion, is it worth spending the extra $80 on the extra 16 of ram?  Sorry if I'm using the wrong lingo, hopefully you get the gist.\n\nSecond question that is a bit off topic, but you seem to REALLY know your stuff and I'm so impressed.  What do you recommend for data hoarders to use to back up their data?  My refurbished pc began to fail last week at the worst possible time and I realized I hadn't backed anything up in about two months.   Do you recommend any particular program?  I've just been copying and pasting my data onto an external but can't find a system to keep track of what I've backed up.  I suck at tech stuff but do have a TON of data that I must keep secure.

  "I've looked at both laptops. The first laptop with an AMD processor is a decent processor, but the one with the core ultra 7 may be better, although I am not sure. Which model of Ultra 7 is it? 64GB of RAM will not be used much, but you won't notice any slowdowns related to RAM for sure. The graphics card of the second one will help with graphics processing, but you need CPU for audio processing. \nFor double the price, it isn't double the performance.\nHP has been notorious for build quality issues. People seem to love Lenovo ThinkPads (specifically the T and P series) but personally I cannot vouch for them. \nLess ports is a thing that everyone is doing. it's cheaper and it looks nicer, although it limits usability. do note that a good laptop dock can cost $400. I would go for a better processor, at least a processor with an H at the end of it. Like an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H or Intel Core i7-13500H. Those would be perfect for flawless dj work, and it should be over the minimum enough to avoid slowdowns. \nI wouldn't go for 16GB anything, as I described above.",

Intel made this to compete with NVIDIA, and they have worked a few years on it. They have a full size GPU out and it did very well apart from compatibility issues that are now largely resolved. They are not top line yet, but Intel is a monster of a company with a place in the market, it will catch up. I can imagine people saying instead of two big GPU makers there are three. Also imagine how much benefit they could get from combining the power of their CPU and GPU? They make your Core Ultra NPU's as well.\n\nAnyways hoped that answered some of your questions.

No good!\nYes, it is totally worth the extra $80, although really it should be no more than $40, but don't expect to find a fair upcharge. \nIf you hate your laptops breaking constantly, try getting a business class laptop, I also recommend spending more to spend less on the future. I know it hurts. I really do.\nFor data hoarders, windows has a built in backup thing called backup and restore windows 7, you can still find it in windows 11 or 10. I use it every single month, works great. I also use AOMEI to do a second set of backups (same data different medium) have not had to ever use those backups so I don't know how well aomei works but backup and restore, well,.you can restore from right there. There is a recommended method for data backup, but I am not going to type that out. I recommend getting two external HDD if whatever size, maybe 2TB or 1TB (TB is TeraByte, 1,000GB or 1,024GB (windows makes this weird, it's why your drives may seem smaller than advertised, not going to explain it)) those two HDD should have the exact same stuff on them, if one fails which HDD's do, mechanical spinning disks, you will have time to buy and receive a new one and not lose any data. I personally backup to two separate HDD, one is bigger so one has more data, but all the same data, and then I also have various external drives that I use to keep single use data, for archival purposes. Cannot lose all those books.  HDD failure is a fact of life but if you buy a decent HDD (I buy Seagate ones) then treat it like it can happen but not likely to. Be aware but not afraid.\nI have a 500GB Samsung T7 which I love because it's aluminum chassis and I think cost me a out $30USD, I could be wrong. SSD is more expensive per GB of data but it will take a VERY long time to wear away especially if you write around a TB a month. Also when SSD fail unless it's on fire, you can still get data off of it you just can't put it on. No writing, only reading. Makes it basically fail proof. Never store data for more than 5 years, it can fade away. Make sure plug it in leave it there every year or so, something like that. \n\nMy eyes burning so no fixing red lines\n\nNo problem, I love helping you guys out.\nI want to acknowledge all the guys in my field who make a living off of their passion. it's not easy. People are not accommodating and are frankly rude and disrespectful. I hate seeing computer shop owners so jaded, because it tells of the abuse they have suffered. It's getting harder to repair, it's getting harder to find parts, and companies are going out of their way to make an extra buck just so you throw your device away after a year or two. I even found it a bit exasperating having 32 notifications once just trying to eat my dinner (wasn't that much  of a dinner, I burned my eggs). It can be frustrating. On top of that some Redditers got angry over the fact that I made a guide in the first place. Comments of appreciation like yours are so helpful, and make me want to do this and better next year.

  "Yes, upgrading RAM is something that you can do, but requires know how and a not smooth brain. Gotta be familiar and comfortable with screwdrivers. Essentially painting a very delicate picture.

Samsung A series is a really good line of phones that were created to be on a budget. \n\nMotorola is owned by Lenovo. I personally own the Moto G Power 5G 2024. I didn't choose the phone, because I am not in a financial position to choose.

There is 1 nice curve to counter that but it doesn't fully let the exhaust open, some air blows onto the screen due to this.\nIt is also getting quite hot during the update process, as I saw on the zenbook reviews (way more reviews on that one then the cheaper Vivobook S16 with this specific cpu).\n\nI have an asus motherboard in my desktop and their thermal pads are crap, so at some point I will probably repoace the pads and paste with upsiren putty and ptm 7950, I hope this will help get less hot, we'll see.",

Specifically look for the H. \nCan't recommend a laptop because I don't know how much it is in your region, and I haven't used it, so how can I recommend?\n\nCPU will need to be powerful so you don't experience ANY stutter when doing your work. \nI suggest 32GB RAM up.",

  "It won't get less hot, but it will disperse heat more easily. if it's a problem, I would look into adjusting the fan curve. Although that can be irritating as the fans are louder. So glad you seem to love it, sorry the cooling has issues, but it will be hot for first few hours or days after purchasing as windows settles in.\n\nFan curve can be hard to change, I use speedfan, if that doesn't work, then I have to look into a model specific work around. Doesn't mess with anything other than fan speed, so pretty safe id say. I always have my fans at highest. I must have cooling and not cooking.",

I'll look into the fan curve options there before using speedfan.\nWhat I didn't knew is that it needs to settle in in the beginning though, thanks for that info!\nI was happy with what I saw when I opened the laptop fyi, it seems well done and I don't think I'll re-do the thermal in the first year, we'll see after that or if I get issues before that.

  "Thinkbook 16p gen 4 vs legion slim 7 (Amd) I’m coming from a 2020 MacBook Pro 13 with gen 10 i5 and I’m gonna need a windows machine for university (last two years in mechanical engineering). I’ve been flawlessly using boot camp since now but I don’t think it’s gonna be able to keep up with the other programs we are gonna use.\n\nThe choice came down to these two mainly because of the design, portability and power/price ratio. I’ve also been thinking about using a desktop remotely through my Mac but I don’t need that much power nor having to leave it on every time.\n\nWith actual sales they both sell for ~1600€\n\nThe main differences and concerns between these two are the following:\n\n- bigger trackpad on the thinkbook, and I’m a big trackpad user\n\n- the battery is bigger on the legion (99 vs 80)\n\n- the thinkbook gets the i9 13900H or the i7 13700H for roughly the same price but maybe the i9 is “overkill” and drains too much power. On the other hand the ryzen 7 on the legion appears to be much more powerful efficient while on battery\n\n- I was also concerned about the number of p cores on the intel vs the amd, which instead has no e cores\n\n- apparently the silent mode on the legion allows better performances, is it because of different cooling system?\n\n- the thinkbook has ir so works with face unlock\n\n- on the thinkbook configurator it doesn’t allow me to have both 32 gb of ram and the 3,2k monitor. Fortunately both the ram are upgradable (the legion has a soldered one) so I can buy the 8+8 version and switch them in the future if I need. \n\n- the WQXGA display has better nits on the legion than the thinkbook (500 vs 400)\n\nI’d like to know if the 3,2k monitor is any better than the WQXGA (2560 x 1600) and if it’s battery killer too because is available in both.\n\nThey both have the 4060 8gb that is more than enough for what I need but should allow some gaming and 3d modeling and rendering room.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, or maybe can suggest another laptop, with similar design, I’d be really happy.",

  "Zen 3 mobile (5000 series) is decently well optimized in laptops on average in terms of performance and efficiency (especially thermals as well), so in my personal opinion (and from experience with using them at my workplace, a computer repair store), I trust the battery life of laptops with Ryzen CPUs inside more than those with 11th or 12th gen Intel CPUs.\n\nMost manufacturers set the default power limits too high for an otherwise modern ultrabook class of computer, just to eke out as much performance as they can in exchange for momentary bursts in temperature and power draw, compared to computers in the past.\n\ntl;dr: Elitebook 845 G8 is better because of the CPU it uses which offers both better performance and power efficiency over \"equivalent\" Intel offerings.\n\nHP also uses a mostly metal chassis as well, which are built fairly sturdily/solid from experience of using them, while recent ThinkPads tend to default more towards hard plastic for a good portion of laptops, if not, then a hybrid between hard plastic and magnesium/aluminium, (mixed experiences, some models have varying levels of chassis flex while others are fine).",

  "Thinkbook 14p (2nd gen) vs Ideapad Gaming 3 (6th gen) I am about to buy a laptop and I am choosing between those two models.

  "The ASUS Flip 13 UX363EA (OLED, Core i5 Intel 11th GEN) - Actual user review, no technical BS Okay. So I'd been considering this laptop over the MBA M1 because they were same prices and ended up getting this one - the ASUS Flip 13 UX363EA.\n\nI WILL NOT compare the two laptops in this review because all the comparisons is pointless, like apples and oranges. I will just share my experience with this products after 1 month of use.\n\nOVERALL IMPRESSIONS: the laptop is extremely lightweight, has amazing OLED screen, sturdy, performs fairly well consider the small form factor, the pen support (with included pen) is a very nice feature to have since I am an architect.\n\n1. THE BUILD:\n   1. The laptop is very sturdy, I accidently hit it with other things while moving around a couple of times but there is barely not a dent. There are almost no flexing anywhere, the hinges are firm and smooth, the screen with not move the laptop around, unlike the UX325, you can open the screen easily with one hand, the transitions in 360 degree mode is very smooth and does not feel like anything is breaking at all lol.\n   2. The materials are nice, although I do not like the sharp corners and edge, it is not comfortable with you hold the laptop or using it in tablet mode.\n   3. The keyboard are nice, it has good travel and the keys are firm and feels good but due to the small size of the laptop, it takes a while to get used to it and make less mistake while typing.\n   4. The touchpad with calculator function seems nice but not very practical because most of the time you open the calculator app with in the app is opened under other apps so you have to bring it up to use it,  but kudos for anyone who finds it useful. Besides that it is a very good mouse pad, good palm protection, good and accurate tracking, comfortable to use and reasonably big enough.\n2. THE SCREEN:\n   1. This is the first time I experience an OLED screen on a laptop and this is the main reason I get this product out of the two mentioned. All of my experiences with laptop LCD screens so far was terrible, I always get some kind of brighter spots on the screens after awhile, even with premium laptops like the Dell XPS 15 or Surface Pros. To be honest, IT IS AMAZING. The colors, the contrast, deep blacks... draws your eyes into the screen and just makes you want to use the laptop more. The screen is stated highly for color accuracy but I have no idea how to rate it. It is very bright too, at about 50% brightness, you can use the laptop comfortably in a well-lit room during daytime, at 80% it is usable outside under sunlight.\n   2. There are some cons, too (surely): Windows handles HDR TERRIBLY, the SDR colors become washed out and looks dark, so best option is to turn it off; If you watch a fairly low quality videos in a dark room, you will experience something called black crushing. This a a commonly know thing for OLED screens and it is due to the compressions of videos.\n   3. About the durability of the screen, people are worried about the burn-ins of the OLED screens. There are things I'm saying here that would ease your minds: ASUS is offering 2-year International Warranty for this product so you're safe in 2 years time. Plus, Samsung is the one who makes this panel for ASUS and I have NEVER had any issues with Samsung AMOLED screens on phones since the Galaxy S3 (I have always uses the Galaxy lines since), so it is somewhat an ease of mind. There are options on windows you can use to protect the screen also, like auto-hide the task bar, using dark themes, not using max brightness often, leave every screen protection options on MY ASUS app on...\n3. THE PERFORMANCE:\n   1. Okay, now we're talking. A laptop with nice screens and all but without a reliable performance it is nothing but trash. Luckily, it might take a long time for this computer to actually goes to the trash.---The performance is good in my experience, it starts up fast, under 2 seconds after you open the lit and it is ready to use. It performs all of my regularly used software effortlessly. Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketchup Pro, Mixcraft Studios, AutoCAD, Blender... runs smoothly and fast. I would not use this laptop for heavy work like renderings or video composing though since it is a laptop (who would seriously work professionally on a ultrabook laptop?) but opening files to check and show to clients is out of the question, very convenient.\n   2. Gaming on this laptop just exceeds my expectations. Surely you won't be blasting off demons with double barrel shotgun at 60fps in Doom Eternals but most games I tested runs fairly well at 720p (not so bad considering the screen is just 1080p). Age of Empire 2 DE, DOTA 2, FIFA ONLINE 4, DIABLO 3, Leagues of Legends, Little Nightmares, Rockets Leagues, XCOM 2... runs at 60fps with decent settings and other AAA games like The Witcher 3, DOOM Eternals, Resident Evil 2 remake, GTAV... can run at 30fps which is playable with low settings... you get the ideas.\n   3. Thermal performance is good, there are many people complains about the computer runs hot out of the box, it is because Windows upgrading a lot of thing in the background when you first boot it up, it gets normal after all of the updates are installed. I have not been experienced any thermal throttling during my first month. With balance settings on performance and fan control, the laptop runs idle and light use at about 38-42C and the fan rarely kicks in which is good considering my country is so hot. Under load, it have not reached 80C on me and still usable on lap. The fans are very quiet, I can barely hear the noise even in my bedroom, in the middle of the night. I am very impressed with the thermal performance of this computer.\n4. THE BATTERY LIFE:\n   1. So far so good, the laptop is Intel EVO certified that means it should last about 9 hours in regular use. BUT, life is not what people says on papers. Under normal use, with everything I need installed, the computer lasts around 5 hours for me but please note that I limit the charge to 80% and will not continue to use the laptop if the battery is under 10%. It just my things to protect the battery. So a full battery should carry you at least another 1.5 hours more. It is still very good considering windows laptops battery have ALWAYS been bad on my. My Surface Pro 6 was barely hit 4 hours of use with full charge.\n   2. There are things you can do to improve the battery further though, like using dark modes and dark wallpapers (OLED screen blessings), set the fan control to Whispering mode and turn on battery saver if you just use the laptop for light tasks.\n5. SO... SHOULD YOU GET IT? Well, it depends entirely for what you want to get out of your laptop. For me I would recommend this laptop if you:\n   1. Want an OLED screen on a decent laptop\n   2. Hate Apple but still want similar performance to a macbook air\n   3. Have to use Windows but really want a lightweight and versatile laptop\n   4. Love drawing.",

  "Tbf when it comes to battery performance, not just normal performance, then that's to take into account too, some people could really use the extra hours of battery and not mind the cheaper build quality. I'm not saying that they should be going for the HP and that you shouldn't give a crap about build quality, all I'm saying is that battery performance can be just as important. That's what made me get my LOQ 15APH8, just because it had a Ryzen which offered low-key double the battery life of the Intel counterpart.",
  "BTW OP I am pretty much sure LPDDR5 is soldered ram, the hp one says DDR5 which means it is probably the socketed one. Meaning you can upgrade the HP but not the lenovo. In this case, the HP is probably a better choice, the hp 15 isn't even that bad. I have no clue why people are calling it a cheap build - then again people hate on HP just because why not.",

  "Laptop for Research Work with Specs Close to Surface Book 3 but with 11th Gen i7 or Similar? Current laptop: Lenovo Yoga 910 i7 7500U/16GB RAM/1 TB SSD/4k display \n\nFeatures I'm trying to improve: lack of pen support, webcam placement, processing power, high-pitched fan\n\nI'm a researcher and this would be my main device. I move a lot and so do not want an external monitor nor to switch to a desktop. I heavily use Office Suite, many Chrome tabs, video conferencing, Youtube, Adobe Photoshop + Illustrator, 4k photo editing, moderate video editing, and Python. I do not game at all.\n\nFeatures I am looking for in a laptop: \n\n11ith gen i7 CPU + \\*\\*\n\n32GB RAM + \\*\n\n4k or near resolution screen (not AMOLED) \\*\\*\n\n2-in-1 convertible with pen support \\*\\*\n\nUSB-A port built-in \\*\\*\\*\n\n15\" screen \\*\\*\n\n1080p webcam \\*\n\nBattery life \\~7 hours non-intensive use (web browsing/Youtube) \\*\\*\n\nHDMI port or Thunderbolt cherries on top, but not a requirement \\*\n\nThe closest laptop I have found seems to be the Microsoft Surface Book 3 minus the CPU. I'm rather dongle-averse outside of a USB-C to HDMI converter (so the idea of an external webcam is not the most exciting), so I've nixed the XPS 15 2-in-1. \n\nPrice isn't a consideration really, but sub-$4000 would be nice and I would be willing to go above that if there was a device that had everything above.\n\nAre there any laptops that fit this bill on the market? The closest I can see outside of the Surface Book 3 are the HP Dragonfly Elite G2/Max (but there you have to choose between 4k screen and 1080p webcam) which is \\~13\", Surface Pro 7+ (smaller profile, 1080p screen), and the Elitebook 1040 G8 (720p webcam, estimated delivery date of late July so would be waiting half a year in which time something else could release). I thought there were 2-in-1 Zbooks, but they seem to not be on the HP website anymore/not part of the latest generation and these anyway wouldn't have a better webcam.\n\nI find it kind of ironic that mostly smaller laptops have the specs I'm looking for, so it makes me think that larger convertibles might come to market with upgraded RAM and webcams, the latter especially, in the next cycle. Would that release be in the fall or is there a summer expo? \n\nAm I judging the CPU on the Surface Book 3 unfairly? The reviews online rail about how much worse 10th generation is than 11th and the test graphs seem to support that. I'm coming from 7th gen, but I also want this device to last 3-4 years minimum and don't want to commit to last generation's CPU if something is going to come out with all the specs within a year and I doubt there will be a surprise Surface Book 3 CPU refresh since it just came out. I would also not take advantage of the detachable tablet feature of the Surface Book 3 outside of flipping the screen to cover the keyboard in tablet mode, which is its main feature, so feels like a bit of a waste there? \n\nThanks for any help!",
  "I'm in the same market and haven't really seen anything beyond what you've mentioned. I'll probably just wait around until the SB3 gets a processor refresh.\n\nThe processor refresh on the SB2 occurred \\~1.5 years after the initial release, but hopefully this one would be sooner as there was quite a bit of negativity around the SB3 processors so MS should be quite clear on what they need to do.\n\nAs usual though, if you're always looking to buy the tech just over the horizon, you'll always be waiting.",
  "My 3 Month in Review of the Asus Rog Strix G15 Laptop.   This is a review of owning the Asus Rog Strix G15 for 3 months and what I think about it. The laptop was a Christmas gift from my parents since I needed a laptop for online school and wanted something portable with a large keyboard. The laptop I chose was the Asus Rog Strix G15. Some may ask “Why would you need a laptop with those type of specs for schoolwork?” Now while I use this laptop for school, I also use it for stuff such as video editing, gaming, and 3D modeling design. I will be going over some pros and cons on the laptops size, practicality, performance, noise, battery, screen, and keyboard. While this laptop is a great laptop with amazing performance, there are some things you may want to know before purchasing this little machine. Note, the model I have is not the Zephyrus model.\n\nThe size of the G15:\n\nThe Asus Rog Strix G15 is on the chunkier side making it a tad bit heavy. While it is not too noticeable while in use, putting it in a carrying case or a bookbag can be a bit of a struggle. While the base of the laptop is pretty thick the screen is surprisingly thin for a gaming laptop, we will go more into the screen later since there are some very important things to know about it. While we are talking about the base of the laptop lets discuss the lack of ports on the G15. The G15 is lacking a nice number of ports on it with only 7 on the laptop. These 7 ports are a single aux port, 3 USB 3.2 Ports, 1 HDMI port, an ethernet port, 1 usb-c port, and the charging port. Considering the thickness of the laptop this is disappointing considering that this laptop is recent and a laptop that most likely would need more ports considering that gaming laptops are also used for a lot of other stuff like workstation work and high-power work.\n\nOverall, the size of the laptop ranks in at a 6.5/10.\n\nThe practicality of the G15:\n\nThe G15 would most likely be more practical in a home to office or light travel scenario since the laptop would probably not be the best in long travel due to its weight and size limiting its portability. The G15 preforms great with light multi-tasking and gaming, that is if you are near a power source. The G15 certainly is a good option for work that would usually take place on a desktop pc which makes it a great portable option to go along with your desktop due to the ability to do the same work on multiple computer’s has becoming better and easier to do lately, like google drive, google docs, and the cloud allowing data transfer and multitasking to be easier than it has ever been. Instead of having to copy data over on a usb or external drive, options like the cloud or google drive make it easier and less of a hassle making gaming laptops like the G15 a great option as a side computer. \n\nOverall, the practicality of the G15 ranks in at a 7/10.\n\nThe performance of the G15:\n\nThe G15 definitely is a powerhouse of a laptop, the specs of the one I have is a 10th Gen Core i7-10750H with a base clock of 2.60 GHz along with a decent 6 cores and 12 threads which should keep up for a nice bit, While Intel certainly has been doing pretty bad lately getting demolished by AMD, the i7-10750H still manages to preform great considering it is a mobile processor. From what I have looked into, it seems to be nearly identical to the i7-8700k, now while the i7-8700k is an 8th gen processor, it still is a really great processor, and as someone who owns a i7-8700k I can confirm it performs really well. While looking at some benchmark results of the i7-10750H and the i7-8700k they appear to be identical, with the i7-10750H even doing a bit better in some games, now while the i7-8700k I own is water cooled meaning if I personally bench marked it, it would most likely be a bit higher since the i7-10750H is a laptop CPU, it still provides a nice idea of how the i7-10750H Preforms. One of the games I enjoy playing on the G15 is overwatch, overwatch on high settings runs at a great range of fps in the 120fps-150fps making overwatch more then playable and look great on this little laptop. When choosing the graphics processor, I decided on the RTX 2070 since I was aware that I would not have the choice in the future to upgrade this, I felt the RTX 2070 should do a great job for what I use the laptop for and should be able to keep up with technology for a nice bit. The RTX 2070 preforms great for gaming and will give me the ability to use the recent RTX feature that has been becoming more popular and gaining support on new games. While I could have just waited for the RTX 3000 Series to be available on laptops and could have got a laptop with a newer graphics processor, I personally needed a laptop sooner due to school. When choosing memory, I simply went with 16GB running at 2933 MHz knowing I will probably be able to upgrade this, and that 16GB should be enough for me now. Honestly 16GB seems to work great for school, gaming, and simple video editing. For memory I recommend going with the 16GB Option. The storage options that came with my laptop is an Intel 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD which seems to do the job pretty well at the moment, when buying this laptop, the minimum amount of storage I would get is 1TB, I really wasn’t to concerned with speed I just wanted a good 1TB SSD to come factory in it. While I am most likely going to add more storage or upgrade the current storage since I usually use a big amount of space, Its great for me at the moment and a decently fast. A good thing about having your main storage an SSD is you won’t need to worry about it breaking from impact or failure since it is a SSD. One thing I forgot to mention is the armory crate app that comes pre-installed on the laptop, there even is a button on the keyboard that when pressed opens up the app. Armory crate is pretty helpful and allows you to choose between modes to accommodate whatever type of work or gaming you are doing to help performance or save battery life, The 3 modes that you can choose from are Silent, this can be helpful to reduce fan noise and save energy while doing basic work like a word document or simple web searching, Though this mode is not recommended to use while gaming since it decreases performance majorly. The second mode is Performance, this is best to use when gaming or doing workstation work while not plugged in and on battery, while your battery will drain faster, it still delivers a decent amount of performance on battery. The last mode is turbo mode, Turbo mode basically will give you higher clock speeds on your CPU and GPU and forgets about battery and noise, making your fans blow at full power to cool the system due to the higher clock speeds and power. This mode can only be used while connected to power. \n\nOverall, the performance of the G15 ranks in at a 9/10.\n\nThe cooling and fan noise of the G15:\n\nWhile the cooling system on the G15 seems to do decently well, the fans definitely are not quiet on turbo mode, In order to cool the hefty 10th Gen i7 and RTX 2070 the laptop has, the fan speed starts to get loud during gameplay and may be a issue if you do not have headphones. Since I usually use headphones while using my laptop it does not become too much of an issue for me but may be a problem for some other people. Then again this is common on gaming laptops since laptops are way smaller than pcs and have a smaller space to work with, meaning cooling is typically small. Personally, I really have not seen much of an issue with the cooling, but that may be since I usually don’t check temperatures while gaming so I’m not entirely sure.\n\nOverall, the cooling and fan noise of the G15 ranks in at a 5/10.\n\nThe Battery of the G15: \n\nTo start off, Its shit. While I have been using the laptop for 3 months now I must have it plugged in most of the time. The battery is probably the one thing I hate most on this laptop. Even doing basic stuff like streaming the web or looking at documents it still drains like crazy, I will get 2 to 4 hours at most if I am lucky. With gaming, oh boy do not even get me started with gaming. If you want to game for an hour or more, you better have that charger next to you and plugged in. While I am positive there are multiple things you can do to improve battery life and I will probably even try them out and update you guys on how it goes, but yeah battery life is not the best. But do not let this discourage you from getting the laptop if you are just going to be using this around your house and taking it to the office, Its still great. Just be sure to bring your charger with you.\n\nOverall, the battery of the G15 ranks in at a 2.5/10.\n\nThe screen of the G15:\n\nTo start off, the screen on this laptop is amazing. The screen on my G15 runs at 240hz and trust me if you have not seen 240hz you are missing out. The 240hz really shines brightest when playing games, especially since the G15 can run games at high fps taking advantage of the 240hz giving you amazing gameplay. Now even though the G15’s is a 15’6 inch laptop, you really wont notice it once you get used to the size and if you have your laptop closer to you. The brightness of the screen is decent, the colors look good as well, I mean it is nothing too special but still looks nice. Now while the G15’s Display has a lot of good qualities, it also has some bad ones. One big one about it is there is no webcam, Which I found out after getting it. This meant I had to buy an external webcam and well due to the screen being slim, you have to mess around with the external webcam since it won’t really sit right on the screen, I still find it crazy that a recent laptop doesn’t have a webcam. So, keep that in mind, if you are going to buy the G15, get a webcam with it. Another issue with the display is its really flexible and flimsy, which some may think that’s not too big of an issue, But the wide gap in between the screen and the base of the laptop allows cables to fit right into the gap, if a cable is in the gap while you close the screen, Well lets just say you will probably be on the phone with ASUS support. \n\nOverall, the screen of the G15 ranks in at 8/10.\n\nThe keyboard of the G15:\n\nThe keyboard of the G15 is a pretty solid keyboard, the size of the G15’s keyboard is pretty decent, while it might take a little to get used to it, I really didn’t find much of an issue with the size. The keys are not that tall which might feel weird if you are coming from a gaming keyboard, but easy to get used to. The keys are pretty silent and have a great feeling click on them, When I got the laptop, I thought the keyboard would be hard to get used to but surprisingly it really isn’t that bad. \n\nOverall, the keyboard of the G15 ranks in at 7.5/10.\n\nIn conclusion, the G15 is a great laptop with respectable performance and a great screen. While the G15 is not the best for travel, it is a great option to go along with your PC. While the battery is not the best, I would definitely recommend the G15 to people who are looking for a quality gaming laptop to do stuff like gaming, video editing, workstation work, or 3D modeling in a portable(ish) package with great performance. I hope this review was helpful to anyone thinking about buying the G15."
