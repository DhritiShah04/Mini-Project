  "ASUS TUF A15, Lenovo LOQ 15 or Lenovo Legion Slim 5 with slightly lower specs? I’m an architecture student, I want a budget-friendly gaming laptop that is strong for renders and 3D softwares, also I don’t own a PS5 or a next-gen gaming console, which might be the case for a long while, so I want a laptop that also performs well in games. I currently have 3 options that I cannot decide between:\n\n1-ASUS TUF A15 Ryzen 7 7735hs RTX 4060 8gb VRAM 1080p 144hz\n\n2-Lenovo LOQ 15 intel i7 13620h RTX 4060 8gb 1080p 144hz\n\n3-Lenovo Legion Slim 5 intel i7 13700h RTX 4050 6gb VRAM 2K display 165hz\n\nThe ASUS is the cheapest, with both the LOQ and the Legion being equally priced. I went to a store and asked one of the workers there about the ASUS and told me so many good stuff about it compared to the LOQ, such as the cooling system and build quality, but watching reviews on this model of ASUS, all comments on it are kinda mixed which makes me scared of getting it, I’m more convinced about getting the LOQ because I heard it has a better display which is something that strongly matters to me. \n\nAs for the Legion, I heard that it’s the BEST budget gaming laptop there is, though considering that it’s gpu is 4050 instead of 4060, it makes me scared of regretting my purchase, since 4060 is significantly better than the 4050.\n\nSorry for all of this text, but I would love some advice, if it is based on personal experience that would be a lot better, but all suggestions are welcome, thanks! :))\n\n",
  "I'd do the LOQ or the Legion in your scenario. I know they're promising to be better but the ASUS support stories still scare the shit out of me. I really wouldn't trust in-store workers on anything, they're just trying to sell you stuff. \n\nMeanwhile I've used Lenovo support multiple times for repairs and full part replacements without problems. The 4060 will be way, way better than the 4050, so the LOQ is the best bang for your buck. I have an LOQ with a 7840HS and a mobile 4060 and it's basically my workstation now as well - it plays all games at high/ultra and doesn't have any problems. Had this for almost a year now with no problems.",
  "Thank you for the suggestion! I’ve been thinking about getting the LOQ too, but I haven’t heard great stuff about the thermals and the build quality. Does the build quality feel cheap? Or is it durable enough? And is the cooling good when playing games?",
  "HP victus 3050ti or legion slim 7i 2060 maxq I dont know enough to make this decision on my own, and there are barely any reviews online for the slim 7i. I have been using a HP Victus for the past couple of months, and only had a couple problems with it. the screen hinge is a common issue, the battery is fairly good lasting around 7 hours i would like to say, but sometimes it breaks loose and will last for about 2 and a half hours, the battery percent will sometimes go down 1 percent every minute or so. I dont like how there are no ports on the back for when i dock it and the screen is not exactly colour accurate. From what i know, the tgp is around 75 watts. \n\nThe legion seems like a slight upgrade for me, but im not sure. I think the 2060 in it is slightly more powerful than the one in the Victus (i think a 3050ti is worse than a 2060, im not talking about wattage or variants such as maxq) please advise me if i am wrong though. the processor in the legion is an i7-10750H which under my understanding is slightly LESS powerful than an i5-11400H, also tell me if i am wrong about that.\n\nthe legion has a charging port on the back for easier cable routing for docking, it has a fingerprint scanner (i just think its pretty cool), it has an rgb keyboard (i think), has a better screen that doesnt wobble, is significantly lighter (i take it to school everyday and i dont like lugging around a weight too much), and its very thin. The only problem i can see is that it might get hot as it cant cool properly because of it being thin.\n\nBy the way, i would like the legion to have windows 11, which it doesnt come with, is it bad to upgrade it instead of it being pre-installed?\n\nOh also, the legion supports usb c charging i think which means that even if the battery goes flat, i dont have to lug around a 200 watt charger to school, i could just bring around a light usb c charger.\n\nbasically im asking if i should upgrade(?) to the legion, and if anyone has any extra info on it that i should know. (also if someone could tell me what the battery is like that would be great)\n\nheres the link to the [victus](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/hp-victus-16-1-fhd-144hz-gaming-laptop-intel-i5-rtx-3050-ti?queryID=ec522c28539babb5be3011738398b9a5&objectID=530851), and heres the one for the [legion](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/lenovo-legion-slim-7i-15-6-full-hd-144hz-gaming-laptop-intel-i7-rtx-2060-maxq?queryID=4bc8ebf5275aea41305a81a35cb330ea&objectID=520064)\n\nalso which one do you think looks nicer? i cant decide\n\nThanks everyone",
  "I'd take 2060, 6gb of vram and a 10750 Is more than enough to pair with it\n\nBut it's not that much of an upgrade over yours tbf",

  "Yes, very reputable brand too (don't worry about the number of reviews)",
  "Yeah.  \nKnown brand with good hinges, damn beautiful, great components too.  \nIt's OLED too.  \nI'd buy it for sure.  \n\nOP, I think you're either wasting our time or wasting your money, to say so as nicely as possible.  \nThis laptop is everything you need and want at 1k$.  \nYou want RGB? FINE! Get some laptop with worse specs that's marketed \"for gaming\" and see it suck in games.  \nThis one is good for years if you do proper maintenance.(Just like any other laptop).",
  "Yes",
  "i recently bought the legion pro 5i, all those specs except less storage, no oled and it’s 16in. it has 4 zone rgb. It’s an incredible laptop. imo the legion line has the best laptops for its price, honestly i would pay more for it. i’m LOVING it, the gaming performance is impressive. i also thought it looked boring when i saw it online but in person it looks great. My screen isn’t OLED like the version you posted and i still think it’s fantastic. LOVE that most ports are at the back and not the side. just a well designed and powerful laptop, i would highly recommend.",
  "Sorry guys, its 1049.99 US dollars",
  "If it’s usd, seems like a good deal",
  "Yeah that's pretty good.",
  "It's decent, do some looking around to compare price to other websites",
  "Probably would need to upgrade the RAM tho",
  "No",
  "my laptop had a 3060, same cpu and bettet screen and cost 500 more",
  "Specs like this are worth double that in most places of the world so if you question is is it worth buying, then the answer is yes",
  "Looks a decent laptop at that price. Go ahead and buy it if you like it. Number of reviews don't really mean anything. If you're still on the fence, just look it up on YouTube",
  "Do you guys know when is the best time for a laptop discount? Are there specific day for discount?",
  "yolo",
  "Decent",
  "My friend just bought this, definitely worth the money + the screen is beautiful",

  "Its ok",
  "Going off of what I know with the legion brand, I would only say it depends if it's a metal casing or plastic casing.\n\nPlastic casing from my experience just feels cheaper and easier to break. The metal will give a premium feel.",
  "This is in all possibility, really really good. I remember paying similar amount for i7 8th gen 8GB RAM, 128 GB SSD, 1 TB HDD, 4GB 1080 Ti. This was in 2019 though.",
  "yes ofc",
  "hell yeah. I bought a laptop with an i7-10750H and 3060 6gb in 2021 for like 1800$. I'd be more than happy to upgrade to that(ofc I won't cuz I don't have 1050$)",
  "Good deal!!",
  "It is but I’d still always recommend buying with a warranty. And having it shipped to a local store before picking it up. Like ordering from Best Buy then having them do the set up. (They will catch any problems before you bring it home).",

  "Check out dave2d youtube channel, most of his reviews are gaming laptops of all price ranges. You are best off shopping for slightly older models on big discounts from retailers like bestbuy, they always have good devices on sale",
  "I meaannnn literally anything other than razer blade has shitty rgb no?",
  "There is Asus tuf series but lenevo has better build quality and temps so just go with the lenevo",
  "I understand, but if you want RGB you'll likely get scammed. You'll get scammed by thinking it's still worth the price, when this one is worth 1k$, it's the definition of a 1k$ laptop if you ask me.  \nBest damn thing at this price.  \nNow, with this specs, I must ask, are you looking for a gaming LAPTOP, or a PC?  \nThe laptop is underpowered compared to the PC because of the thermals and battery, but the PC lacks much of the portability.  \nGet a laptop if you need it to be portable, not if it's like the 5th criteria on your list.",
  "I own this laptop . Overall, it's great that even Youtuber Jared's Tech also named it the best 14-inch gaming laptop of 2023 . The display is beautiful, the performance is great, and the downside is soldered ram and mediocre speakers\n\nThe other option i considered was the G14 2023 with 4060 and the G16 2023 4060 they were around 1100 ish after taxes",

  "I've never seen this one 799. I think you're talking about a different model.",

  "You'd probably have to either pay more or start compromising on actual specs.",
  "Ah right, I forgot that this is the slim version. My bad.",

  "Honestly, I think it could handle everything, maybe not at MAX settings, but at good ones and also reviews don't always mean anything, just because something doesn't have a ton of reviews doesn't mean it sucks,just means not that many like to write reviews or that many people haven't found this laptop yet and people also buy such laptops on other sites as well.",

  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

So I currently am using a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, and am planning on upgrading because: A) It is not powerful enough, and B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nI am a student and will primarily be using the laptop for school work, so it needs to be portable and a comfortable weight to bring with me to and from class. I love how portable my 13\" Air is. I've done a LOT of research over the past two years, but never bit the bullet, but I feel like now is the time, and so I've committed to buying one now.\n\nMy use cases (in order of importance): School, Music Production, Photoshop, Gaming\n\nI don't play a lot of games but it would be nice to have a machine to play some Civ 6 or even some other, more intensive games like BO2/BO3 Zombies (and MAYBEEEE some RDR2) when I am on a plane for a long time. I want something that's decent on battery life, I don't spend all day at school, maybe 4 hours at most on a given day, so I want something that'll last me that long doing just school work without having to even worry about bringing a charger.\n\nNow, I've looked at like tens of laptops, from gaming to notebook, and I've seen some I've considered like the Zenbook S16, Lenovo Slim 7i Aura, Zenbook 14, Zenbook A14, but I've narrowed it down to a couple:\n\nZephyrus G14/G16 - The clear winner for me, problem is it is just too expensive, and the only models that go on sale into my price range are the 4050 G14 and 4060 G16 models which I've heard may not be worth it. They don't go on sale super often, and the ones that do are open box. (Currently can get the 4050 model for $1499 CAD open box)\n\nZenbook Duo 2024 (Ultra 9, 32GB, 1TB, 60hz 1080p model) - I've toyed with the idea of having this laptop for a while. My PC setup at home has 3 monitors and I absolutely love it, and could see myself getting genuine use out of both screens when writing an assignment, key word being WHEN I am doing an assignment, which isn't an every day thing. I don't think it would be powerful enough to handle any gaming at all. Surprisingly, this is actually cheaper than both the G14 and G16 Models I would be getting. (Currently can get it Refurb-Excellent for $1519 CAD)\n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 15\" - This just came out, and I feel like 15\" is the perfect size for me to be honest. I can get the spec with the Ryzen 7 260, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD (will add another in the future), and a 5060 8GB card for within my price range, around $1750 all in. It's around 4 pounds which is the heaviest of the three, but is also the fastest of the three. It's so new that there isn't a single review yet for it. (Brand new for $1750 CAD, could try and haggle it at Lenovo)\n\nThese are my three ideas right now in terms of what to get. Does anyone have any recommendations? Anyone with these laptops have advice?\n\nI'd not like to spend more than $2000 CAD.\n\nEDIT: In case it wasn't clear, this is not meant to be a desktop replacement; I already have one.",
  "Well you need to be aware of the fact that most gaming laptops have a dedicated gpu they are loud heavy and the battery life is 3hours at best and the performance is ass when on battery .\nSo you’ll want something with a powerful igpu like a Ryzen ai 300 series (the Ryzen 7 or 9 models) or the intel core ultra 200 series ( like the ultra 7 258v) these have the most powerful iGPUs currently available. Also their batter life is pretty good.",
  "Don't buy the Zenbook duo. It's more of a gimmick and not a good choice for your use case. \n\nGaming laptops all suffer from battery life. They always need to be plugged in. They don't last long. \n\nYou might want to get something with a modern AMD Ryzen 8000 series CPU. The integrated graphics are good for some light gaming. These CPU are also power efficient so you get good battery life.\n\nAsus Zenbook S16 and Zenbook 14 should be the models to consider. The models with AMD Ryzen CPUs.",
  ">B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nGood luck.",
  "Thanks!",
  "wdym? ive been using windows for my entire life and got a macbook on a whim in 2020 and i can say with certainty that windows is much better (at least for me)",
  "Ok, as I said ... good luck.",
  "Is this a good laptop? Looking to buy a laptop to use for Unity, Substance painter/ photoshop/ Blender, video editing and VR Gaming. Is this good enough?",
  "No such thing as a bad product. Just a bad price",
  "That looks great, I’ve seen this before and it should upgrade up to 32 GB ram.",
  "Bad display. If you can live with that, it’s good value.",
  "I believe its on sale for 800$\nIs it good for that price?",
  "Not terrible but I would look for a 2560x1600 display for a 16\" laptop",
  "I dont mind the fhd display, but how is the color accuracy \n\nI would be using it mainly for gaming, 3d modeling, and video editing",
  "I would go OLED then. I wouldn't book on any laptop in that price range to have stellar color accuracy but something like this would be really good: https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sku/6548317.p?skuId=6548317",
  "so would the one in your link be a better option for 3d modeling, adobe software, and VR gaming?",
  "Definitely. It has much higher end hardware too. You might want to upgrade the RAM though. Check if it is soldered or not. Also, what VR headset do you have? This laptop doesn't have DisplayPort.",
  "USB Type-C to connect the headset",
  "Then you should be good. Definitely upgrade to 32 or 64GB of RAM though",

  "Choosing to buy between these two Planning to upgrade my laptop and stumble upon these two deals.

  "Is this Laptop Good? With Black Friday coming up, I'm planning to buy a laptop with good performance, decent dedicated GPU, 16GB or more RAM (prefer 32GB so that I won't have to upgrade in the near future), and at least 512 GB SSD.\n\nI'm an engineering student + part freelancer and content creator, so the rig will be used for things like: CAD, simulation software, VMs, Video Editing, video conferencing, and recording videos for YT. Emphasis on multi-tasking with other work like coding on an IDE or using Office. **Most importantly, the laptop must run smoothly for at least 5 years** while not getting gen-zoned by future OS updates.\n\nI have been looking around a lot and have found some good choices among ASUS and Lenovo machines (a bit disinclined towards the latter). While doing so, I came across this: [https://progamerstech.com/product/eluktronics-rp-15-g2-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-7840hs-octa-core-cpu-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-gpu-15-6-qhd-165hz-display-2tb-pcie-gen-4-ssd-64gb-ddr5-ram-wi-fi-6e-rgb-backlit-keyboard/](https://progamerstech.com/product/eluktronics-rp-15-g2-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-7840hs-octa-core-cpu-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-gpu-15-6-qhd-165hz-display-2tb-pcie-gen-4-ssd-64gb-ddr5-ram-wi-fi-6e-rgb-backlit-keyboard/)\n\nIt's not a well-known brand so I don't see many reviews anywhere. But it looks like a steal at this price - the specs are leagues above the competition (compare with the Lenovo Legion Slim 5). But that's what's making me skeptic: is there a catch here? Like poor longevity, battery life, or something else? Anyone who has any experience, please give some valuable insight.",
  "It has been my experience that getting 3 years out of a gaming laptop will be a sign of insane good luck.  While it's certainly possible to have one last longer, I haven't seen it happen very often at all.",
  "Why is it so hard to pick a slight gaming/music production laptop for everyday use and just trust and pick a brand I've been going through it when it comes to buying a laptop, or just picking a reliable brand? Does anyone else have similar problems? First I was like Asus is good and Lenovo, then after watching endless reviews quality and reliability can be an issue with Asus, and people are boycotting Asus now for diverse reasons. Lenovo, I agree that they have really nice laptops, but deals are hard to find, I finally found a Legion Slim 7 Amd that had great specs for the price, as I'm about to checkout, it tells me authentification failed. Contacted the bank and Lenovo, the bank saya there's no activity and Lenovo says its the bank's problem. So basically, I've read endless reviews that this keeps happening and I feel like I can't choose Lenovo as I am frustrated from this situation, so I look elsewhere, check for HP or Dell, Dell has good laptops just pretty expensove for the quality, I feel like there's only MSI and HP Omen, but can't seem to make a decision on like the brand's reliability, quality control and other factors that might play into choosing one. I just want to know how do you guys do it? No matter how much research I do, there's always something. Like HP Omen has bad displays for the price, msi is overpriced unless on sale, Best buy sales for Lenovo are just not as good as their website.",
  "Vostro 7510 Review/ Advice Request  \n\nI really appreciated this (and other) reddit when I was searching for a laptop, and wanted to return the favor with a quick review of this laptop. I am not a formal laptop reviewer, and don’t have fancy gizmos to check nits or color accuracy, but wanted to share. I have only been using it for about a day or two, and I may or may not post some updates as I use this more. There’s also some chance that I will return it. \n\nModel: [https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations)\n\n(purchased on sale for $1150 + 10% CB).\n\nI wouldn’t mind some advice from the sub on whether to keep this or return for one of two slightly more gamery computers that will seemingly solve some of the issues I have with this - either the Lenovo Legion 7 Slim or the HP Omen 16.1 AMD (if it gets released on HP’s site soon enough). \n\n**Background:**\n\nI joined a small business and needed a laptop. I purchased my last laptop \\~11 years ago and while it aged gracefully… that's like 85 in laptop years. Business required that the laptop have Windows 10 Pro, and preferred that it have biometric security. I wanted it to be thin, and have good build quality so it will hold up well. I also wanted to be able to play the new AOE when it comes out (i.e., light RTS and 4x type games). Finally, I needed the laptop yesterday so I didn’t have time to wait around for the best deal.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\nI think this laptop falls short in a few ways: (1) it spontaneously shut down the first day I was using it. Enough battery, updated Microsoft drivers, and no indication of why when I turned it back on. Not sure what it was, but I updated the Dell drivers and it hasn't happened again in the few hours of use since that. (2) Battery life could be better, once I was down to less than 40% after about 3 hours of (non-gaming) use (downloading and installing some applications, light browsing). As I type this I have 2:56 estimated remaining at 77% of the battery on “better battery” setting. The battery estimate was also all over the place. I don’t think it’s fair to expect much more out of a 56 whr battery, but I think it is fair to expect more than a 56 whr battery in this kind of laptop. (3) The keyboard is ok - typing feels nice enough, although I liked my old Lenovo’s keyboard a little bit better. The backlighting is a joke. (4) Cooling. I ran Offworld Trading Company, which was free from Epic Games at the time I received this computer, and after less than 15 minutes of play I found the palm rest to be warm, and (using a food thermometer) found the temperature to be over 100 fahrenheit on the speakers, and about 127 fahrenheit right underneath the vents. The fans were noticeably loud as well. Task manager says the GPU got up to 65c. That seemed pretty warm for a few minutes of play on a 5 year old game.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\nThe strengths are in the specs: i7 with a 3050ti, aluminum chassis (there is a very thin plastic bezel around the screen, but it's small enough to get over. Pretty good build quality. Touchpad is spacious. It’s relatively heavy for a 2021 laptop, but it has a dGPU and is pretty thin. Screen is pretty nice and color accurate, although I suspect nothing special in 2021. And I will be able to play aoe4 on this (when it comes out). \n\n**Dell Customer Service:**\n\nI also wanted to call out a good experience with Dell Customer Service. Without getting into the details, they made things right quickly and followed up to make sure things ended up ok. \n\n**Request for Advice:**\n\nWhen I was looking at this I was also between the Lenovo Legion 7 slim which is a few hundred dollars more, but has a higher refresh screen and the 3060. I decided that because I am looking to play RTS/4x games that are typically not AAA graphically intensive, a 3050 would be enough and I would be better saving the money. \n\nI was also considering the new HP Omen AMD 16.1, but it still hasn't been released on HP’s website (where they have frequent 10% off gaming PC sales), and given that I need something now, I may not be able to wait until they can ship it.\n\nNow that I have used the Vostro, and have pointed out the above concerns, do you think I’ll get (a) significantly better battery life on one of those other options, and (b) is the cooling significant enough to cause problems with my use of the Dell?",
  "Just 1 question. Does it have 1 or 2 SO-DIMM memory slots??\n\nOne review said 8GB is soldered. One Dell maintenance manual shows 2.\n\nI'm between this and the 15\" LG Ultra with the GTX 1650 Ti. The Dell has the true full size number pad, but the LG's is the crammed version.  For me this is between soldered ram or not. If 1 is soldered, then I'll have a tough decision. \n\nSo, please pop the back cover and let us know?\n\nThanks!!",
  "I reached out to Dell. They confirmed its 2x SO-DIMM slots that support up to 64GB RAM!",
  "You’ll need to consider whether you want a gaming laptop or not. The Vostro is not a gaming laptop and won’t perform like one. It is a premium build quality well rounded business laptop with top specs. It will get hot when gaming over long periods of time. If you want something with more power you should consider the Lenovo legion slim 7 or if you don’t want a gamery feeling laptop the Ideapad 5 pro 16.",
  "Do you know if it has one or two M.2 SSD slots/what the storage upgrade options are like?",
  "Hi there, have you been able to play AoE4 on it since the release of the game and would you recommend this laptop for this game? I am looking for a decent laptop for everiday tasks, with a moderate price, and not especially oriented for gaming but I would love to be able to run AoE4 (but no other AAA games that are massively demanding on GPU, CPU and memory).",
  "I just got this laptop RTX3050 version, and I have to say, I believe the design around the battery life and cooling system is very poor. I thought mine is broken, after reading similar stories from other owners similar experiences are confirmed. I’m frustrated and disappointed with this product from Dell. The battery needing to be bigger and cooling system larger. IMO it’s flawed heavily. You can’t game on it either, the RTX3050 is very weak. The screen is average. Considered returning it for a different model but I’m too busy at work. \n\nWould not go with a dell laptop again. I could of paid slightly more and got a different manufacturer with better specifications and most likely none of these cooling and battery issues.\n\nSorry Dell, but this product is piss poor.\n\nEdit: ram dota2 as a test, can’t even get more than 30fps avg, 1080p max textures details. My desktop with Radeon RX5700XT and an old 6 core sandy bridgy CPU sits just below 200 avg\n\n30fps avg in an esports game isn’t playable.\n\nEdit2:  it sure what dell were targeting with its design, it can’t go anywhere without its charger very nearby. Poor gaming performance, terrible thermals. That leaves users with an always plugged laptop that only runs word processing applications and runs like a volcano doing it.\n\nEdit3: screen is 60hz. 2021 they release a mid range laptop with this? Dell are you high? Reason I bought it? It was 40% off. I almost got my boss one whilst awaiting shipping. Pretty glad I didn’t get my employer an absolute dud laptop, that seems like dell were trying to offload\n\nEdit4: finally. At work we run all dell emc servers. Lost a lot of faith on dell consumer, and as a whole if they are pulling this kind of crap I n 2021. We are due for a major upgrade, HPE looking much more convincing",
  "So good",
  "I would wonder why the GTX card if not gaming... I mean, the type of computing (ML, linear algebra) I use for work with an Nvidia card is more demanding than gaming.  If it can't handle gaming, then it can't handle a work setting that requires a GPU.  Otherwise, most workers don't need a dedicated GPU for work (with Word, browsing, etc).  Just puzzled, what's the point of providing a GPU that can't handle gaming.",
  "I have one, same specs as OP but regular 3050, not Ti. It has 2x m.2 slots. The OEM ssd is a very short m2 2230 drive. The other M2 slot can take a normal full length SSD. The short OEM 2230 ssd drive is in the longer m2 slot with a weird metal arm to anchor it to the screw down hole at the end. So if you buy one of these you need to move the OEM ssd to the other m2 slot, then stick your full length SSD in the m2 slot you just took the OEM out of.\n\nIt's easy, and already inside the case are the two heat sinks for SSDs. One small copper one for the OEM shorter 2230 ssd, and a full size heatsink for a normal m2 ssd. \n\nEdit: As per my reply to the other guy below, the battery life is absolute ass on this.",
  "I can run the new Diablo 2 resurrected/remaster on this at max graphics no problem, as long as it's plugged in. That game is a little heavier that you would expect on resources. My Ryzen 4800u with integrated graphics can only handle about low medium graphics. So this thing's pretty decent.\n\nDepending on what you're doing, keep in mind the **battery life is horrible** on this thing. I'm getting worse life than OP when just doing very basic light tasks. I get 3 1/2 to 4 hours max. This is with screen brightness low, no USB devices, the 3050 dGPU disabled, and just using a webbrowser. No gaming or streaming. I've done all manner of tests to squeeze out better battery life and have had not luck (OS reinstall clean, different drivers, setting max CPU usage to 30%, etc.). Dell support told me 4 hours is good battery life for this laptop and referred to the battery as a ***backup battery***.\n\nAlso, if you plan to dual boot to linux this thing won't sleep properly. You can set it to suspend, which defaults to s2idle and uses about 14% battery per hour. Manually modifying the system to deep sleep doesn't work properly, it will start to sleep, then spin up the fans and turn on the keyboard light. This is with Nvidia proprietary driver software and the dGPU off and iGPU on. After researching it, lot's of dell notebooks are doing thing. Dell's forums show things like \"this model doesn't support being set to suspend/sleep and put in a bookbag\".\n\nHopefully this info helps. I'm in the process of returning mine. It's a nice enough laptop, but averaging 3.5 hours of battery life from extremally light tasks with my mentioned battery saving attempts is bad, the linux sleep thing is bad too.\n\nIf you'll mostly be on AC power all day, you'll be fine. But if you're on battery it will not last. Gaming will kill the battery even faster, and it will lower its performance dropping the frame rate badly on battery.",
  "Hey I think your laptop may be broken or you are using it unplugged, because a 3050 usually runs dota 2 at around 120fps at the 65W. Do you run dota while plugged in? because it only uses the integrated intel graphics when unplugged which could explain the low fps.",
  "I ended up buying the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro with an RTX card, dual DIMM slots, and dual SSD slots.  It's a great laptop as long as you don't need battery life beyond 3-4 hours.  LOL",
  "Hey question, are you using windows 10 or 11? I know windows 11 has hit ALOT of laptops negatively in terms of battery life. I’ve heard some people getting up to 4 hours less than they would in windows 10.",
  "To tell the truth I didn’t run it more than a few hours on win10. I did find turning on battery saver made a difference, but it wasn’t major enough. I did also find apps like the brave browser automatically using the dGPU for no reason, setting windows to force it into the iGPU helped a bit.\n\nI did run manjero Linux and was getting batter battery life than when 11, but maybe just an extra 30 mins of light usage.\n\nOver all, I think the battery capacity (56Wh) is just a bit too low for something with an 11800h and dGPU. I tried buying an 86Wh battery from Dell before sending the Vostro back, but they don’t have them in stock.\n\nI moved to a Lenovo P1 G4. That has a 91wH battery, It’s easy to get 4.5-5 hours on that thing without effort.\n\nEdit: more info.",
  "Oh okay thank you for specifying more! Yeah brave turns on hardware acceleration by default for some reason. It’s quite annoying 😂 had a time I was wondering why my laptop fans were spooling up every time I opened brave and was always at a steady 10-30% usage.",
  "Yeah lol, I happened to be looking at task manager and noticed GPU_1 in use with just an empty downloads tab open. Need max power for that.\n\nOther than the battery life, I did really like that vostro.",
  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",

  "Laptop buying advice - choice of 3  So I'm looking to upgrade my laptop next month and I'm considering 3 machines: **The LG Gram**, the **Lenovo Legion 7 Slim** and the **Dell XPS 17**. My budget is between $1500 - 1800 and it's basically for internet surfing, light gaming and streaming movies/shows. I don't upgrade often, maybe once every 10 years ...so my main concern is just getting the best all around rig for the money that will be as future proofed as possible. I would prefer 17'' but will take 15'' if it's a much better laptop or deal. I think the Dell XPS is a little out of my price range but there seems to be one on the Dell site under 'Deals' (just not sure if it's 'for real' a decent XPS). Suggestions ...and why you think it's better than the other two? Also I have seen on reviews that UHD will kill the battery life more of the laptop and unless you KNOW you need it (into hardcore gaming) ... you don't really need it? It's a big step up in price I might not need to consider.  Also, is the Intel I7-11800H still a pretty good CPU these days?",
  "BRO. Just get a \"cheap\" $600 laptop. Use that other money for savings, your mortgage, taxes, a PC, crypto, real estate, stock market. Why spend all that money? With the rest ($900-$1200), you could get a PC or use it for the above or other things.",
  "Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition, AMA? Just received the laptop like 10 minutes ago\nWill try to answer some questions. \nIf you guys want any benchmarks, I can try to do it as well. Battery life those I dont think i can give any at the moment as its fresh out of box.\n\n\n",
  "does it give u unlimited aura",
  "For those that was wondering if pressing the power button does anything when the lid is down and closed,\n\nThe answer is\n\nNo, it does not. You cant switch off your laptop as well even if you press it long enough for normal pc to force shut down. And you cant turn on your laptop as well. Hope this info helps for those worried about the laptop switching itself on in their backpacks.\n\nThough, the laptop does switch itself on by itself when you open the lid, after you shut it down and close the lid (similar to how macbooks are like); add in: just found out you can switch that off in Lenovo Vantage",

  "Got one of these today for testing/review..    Fun fact, you can just leave Battery Saver mode on, disable the Lenovo service that tries to change power limits..  Use Throttlestop to max out the TDP (Lunar Lake doesn't go past 40watts anyways) and let it rip.   The machine stays very very quiet and pulls of a 11,3xx CB23 score which is actually a good bit faster than any review i've seen.  The best part is how cool to the touch this machine is under load/gaming..  Probably the coolest running chassis in a long time, granted the CPU is only pulling like 20\\~ watts while gaming even though I have it set at 40w (game dependent of course will change this).    It's a wonderful machine overall, not perfect but pretty amazing as a daily driver.   Battery tests coming soon..   I previously have tested the Dell XPS 13 with Lunar Lake so that's all I have to compare to so far.",

  "Will you try out linux?",
  "A few things to add in;\n\nLaptop keyboard so far is fantastic, they feel more like the good old membrane keyboard; and definitely feels a lot better to type on compare to laptops like Zephyrus. So far I do feel a Thinkpad's keyboard is definitely better than the Yoga series.\n\nPerformance so far is alright. Gotta test more first before I continue with anything else. \n\nIts a bit unfair to compare like this, but I do get a better experience off with a MBP 14 M1 Pro as the laptop seems more fluid compared to this. Currently I am testing the laptop with Best Performance mode; using mainly chrome with a few tabs (shopping + light browsing) and some Excel work.",

  "So, the laptop is pretty awesome. I’ve had it all week and have found that it’s gotten better with use. The first day I almost took it back because the touchpad was so bad and their own Lenovo Vantage application kept crashing. Once all the updates took effect and the laptop had time to settle in, there were no more issues. \n\nThe WiFi is incredibly fast, and I’ve never experienced a faster initial connection and any device ever, including iPads and iPhones and MacBooks. Instantaneous to the router as soon as your password is in. \n\nThe main feature of the snapdragon version was supposed to be the “snappiness” and the battery life. But this thing has been nothing but snappy—everything happens instantaneously. I’ve never had a machine this responsive. It’s like having your car switch gears without ever feeling the change in the transmission, just unbelievably smooth. That being said, nothing will be the battery life on a Mac, so there’s no real reason to compare. Their ARM efficiency is so vastly ahead of the competition that it’s not even a fair comparison. They’re strange machines to me (MacBooks) in that their computing power is unrivaled, but their interface makes them look like toys for kids rather than serious machines, which I suppose they are but just never really feel that way. My use case on the daily is for Windows-based computing, so that’s why I returned the m3 air I bought earlier this year (that and their new keyboard is awful, paper thin and the keys so closely placed I couldn’t type properly. I was going to lose my mind). Was able to get through work days with no battery life issues, ended up around 40% every day with about 5-6 hours of use, so definitely use dependent. I am not sure if the battery is compromised by having to run a virtual desktop all day? I’m sure someone here can better attest to that. \n\nThe screen is glorious—I’ve never been a fan of OLED for a laptop so that’s actually a plus for me. I almost went and bought a refurbished Lenovo for the mini LED screen it featured, but it was much bigger and heavier than this laptop. \n\nThe portability is insane; the engineering to pack a 15.3” screen while using essentially the body of a 14” laptop is mind boggling. I was reliant on my 2018 intel MacBook Air (still just perfect except for the giant bezels and dwindling battery life) until the aura, and, when you place the 13.3” air over the aura there’s only minimal excess laptop all around. Just an exceedingly slim experience. \n\nI wish the materials were just a tad more premium, with the feeling of the sleek aluminum from the Air still more solid in the hand. Being able to open the laptop with one hand would have been nice, but life goes on. \n\nThe x1carbon aura will probably be the perfect machine w the haptic pad and the choice of oled or IPS based on your preference, so if you’re willing to wait and spend double the cash for the same specs and a one pound lighter laptop then I would do so. I didn’t think it was worth all the extra cash for the upgraded materials, essentially doubling the cost. The HD is fast enough, and for my purposes shelling out extra for a 2280 disk would have made no discernible difference in daily use. \n\nAll in all, stunning and I’m glad I waited for this instead of the yoga 9i meteor lake which was what I was considering previously. \n\n32g \n1 tb \nWindows 11 pro\nAt no additional cost on Lenovos website I was able to also add Office Pro and Acrobat 2020, so that’s an extra $500 or so of software. Good deal right now\n\nArrow Lake and Panther Lake look promising. The future is bright for intel, and the spinoff on their design business is going to be one to invest in for sure.",

Especially since it screws up the sizing of any windows you had set up previously - so now you have to re-do all of that the next time you open your apps.\n\nBluetooth is VERY glitchy, and either won't connect, or when connected, glitches between connected and disconnected.

  "It's made out of aluminum, but when i played around with the yoga 9i and the slim 7x they just felt like better quality. The one thing I didn't mention was the keyboard--it's phenomenal. The main reason I didn't consider the HP or the ASUS, the two main competing lunar lake laptops that look really phenomenal, was that I really disliked their keyboards. This is the best typing experience I may have ever had on a laptop. It's not that this computer isn't well built--it certainly is, it has the military grade durability and so on, but it just doesn't have a \"pro\" look or feel. You can tell it's consumer-grade material. It's like comparing a commercial kitchen product to a consumer grade line--they may be moth stainless steel but there's just a difference in the quality that's probably related objectively in some way, but it's difficult for me to describe or quantify. Please note this is a really nitpicky thing to say--this is the best laptop I've ever owned, and it's not close. I was between this and a macbook pro14\", but I'm super satisfied and felt like it was a great deal to upgrade the RAM to 32 and the 1 tb HD w the free office pro/acrobat std. Really good deal and very high quality with an excellent processor. The silence and coolness of the laptop are really evident as well. I played COD MWIII just to see how it ran compared to my prior Microsoft Surface Book 2 from 2017 which had 16 gb ram and a NVDA 3050 card, and it's not even close how smooth and well this computer handled it. \n\n  \nWould highly recommend if the OLED was an issue for you, because most manufacturers seem to be going OLED route, so if you are happy w the Snapdragon chip and there's no compatibility issues, the only real competitor here would be the Surface laptop, which would cost you another 1500 to have all of the above specs/software. I have been waiting to see what was next for my laptop world since it's been so long, I had to learn a lot about the chip game to understand what I was waiting for. I think the only thing I'd say is if you're not in a hurry, see how these compare to Strix point laptops. If you're like me and have more basic needs that aren't super tech dependent, this is an excellent daily driver. Of course if you have a specialized need you're probably not in this forum anyhow. \n\n\n\nFor the money, you can't get a better laptop. \n\n  \nHope that helps!",

  "Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition review. Too many flaws. Recently received my new Lenovo Slim 7i Aura Edition and have been putting it through it's paces. I ordered a custom 258V 1tb spec from Lenovo. Shipping was fast, packaging is about as barebones as it gets with the charger just flailing around in there, but it arrived in one piece so yay I guess.\n\nSome context: Currently use an X1 Carbon G6 because every new laptop I buy is generally flawed or has issues, prompting me to keep my trusty ThinkPad. Recent attempts at upgrading are as follows:\n\n* Surface laptop 4: Pretty good, but had issues with WiFi and Bluetooth constantly dropping, and random restarts. Sold it after a bit.\n* Lenovo Slim 7 pro X: Great machine but had two major issues: System would occasionally lock up when the 3050 was enabled in the bios, disabling it fixed the lockups. Also, there seemed to be an issue with nvram causing the laptop to fail to boot numerous times.\n* Lenovo Slim pro 7 - Excellent machine, literally zero issues. Truly a unicorn. The build quality was terrible, and thus I returned it. Decent aluminum enclosure, but cheap plastic interior with plastic hinges. Honestly wish I kept it after this.\n* Surface Laptop 7 - Excellent laptop. ARM64 turned out to be a larger issue for me than I thought. Sold it and stuck with X86. A few pretty minor issues but otherwise the best windows laptop available right now imo.\n\nLets get into the Aura.\n\n**Build quality** - It's alright. Typical thin relatively cheap aluminum exterior with an internal frame to keep everything together. Luckily the frame is made of magnesium alloy this time instead of plastic like the slim pro 7. Durability concerns are no more. Port cutouts are somewhat sharp, and you can see inside the laptop from the cutouts. Some ports are slightly misaligned, but everything fits. Certainly not as premium as a surface or a mac, but it'll do. Hinge feels fine, trackpad is installed firm with no rattle. I hate the \"YOGA\" text on the palmrest. It's clearly shiny plastic inserts stuck into a cutout, and not very well mind you, with the text slightly misaligned. It just looks a bit cheap. Overall, it's well built enough for most people to be happy, but it's nowhere near some of it's competitors.\n\n**Display -** Mostly very good. Very bright, very colorful, great pixel density, 120hz, good touch implementation, and completely free of defects. It's not all great though. I generally prefer IPS panels, but the contrast on this one doesn't cut it. All IPS panels have IPS glow, but this one has the worst case of glow I've ever seen. It's even noticeable looking at it straight on, making the panel look almost TN at times. This paired with the relatively poor AR coating create a sub bar display for darker content. It's not terrible, but quite noticeably worse than any typical IPS. Note there is likely a display lottery here, so you're mileage may vary.\n\n**Trackpad / keyboard -** The touchpad is unfortunately not haptic, but it's a very good traditional unit. Smooth surface with a tactile and satisfying click. Feels responsive (when it's working, more on that later), gestures work great, at least as good as they can in W11. Keyboard is excellent, ThinkPad level. Wonderful tactility and travel. The keys also have a soft touch finish to them which feels great. Backlighting is uniform and consistent, if not a little too bright on it's dimmest setting.\n\n**Speakers -** Completely blown away by these. Most windows machines have pretty bad speakers in my experience, but these are excellent. Definitely a bit bass heavy, but no distortion at normal volume levels. They sound full and mostly clear, could do with a bit more midrange. Head and shoulders above any windows machine I've ever used, period.\n\n**Performance / noise -** A little disappointed in the noise output. No complaints with performance, Lunar Lake delivers on what I expected, but the fans are just too noticeable for my taste. Don't get me wrong, huge improvement from my mini jet engine X1C G6 with 8650u when docked, but it's not nearly as quiet as I was hoping for. When docked to my desktop setup via Thunderbolt at 4k 120hz, the fans are frequently noticeable, especially with heavy multitasking. Even unplugged opening a few chrome tabs or an application or two will get the fans to spin up. The system is not hot or even warm really, it's just overly aggressive fan tuning by Lenovo it seems.\n\n**Miscellaneous / software -** WiFi seems to work flawlessly thus far. No dropping of connections, connects upon waking, etc. Bluetooth on the other hand is a little flaky. Occasionally I will hear Bluetooth artifacts and glitches upon moving apart from the laptop. Windows came with some bloat including McAfee, but all was easy to get rid of. Windows hello has been mostly reliable, minus when the system fails to activate the camera and I have to resort to a passcode.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting reliable video output from this thing with my external monitor being the only and primary display. New display drivers and fiddling around with color settings in Intel control panel seemingly at random allowed me to get reliable 4k 120hz YCbCr 444. No specific setting did the trick, it seems to be a bit broken at the moment. Adding on to the state of Intel software, every time I reboot this thing, Intel graphics control panel decides it wants to set custom colors for me that dramatically darken the display, prompting me to go in and reset all color settings. Tried different drivers among other things to no avail. Very strange issue.\n\n**Phantom touches -** Frequently the touchscreen will activate phantom touches in the bottom right corner, possibly because my primary interaction with the screen is with the quick settings for brightness control. This seems to be especially frequent upon waking from sleep, often making the laptop unusable for up to a minute. Sometimes quick settings or hidden icons tray will pop up randomly as I'm working. Extremely annoying.\n\n**The dealbreakers -** I don't know about you, but I prefer my touchpad to work properly. I mean that cant be too much to ask right? Well, either Lenovo has implemented some sort of braindead power saving feature, or there is some sort of driver / hardware issue. After a period of inactivity, like say 1-3 minutes, the trackpad will frequently enter a \"sleep\" state, and not respond to inputs until it has had a second or two to wake up. Sometimes it takes up to around 10 seconds to wake up, which is extremely annoying. I've tried a few fixes for this, including disabling the touch screen to avoid phantom touches, but the issue persists.\n\nNever experienced anything like this. Leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my touchpad hardware. Even if it is a hardware issue, I'd honestly rather not give Lenovo's QC lottery another shot. Besides, we already have issues with the touchscreen, windows hello, and flaky Intel software, while the Slim Pro 7 I tried was literally flawless. Lenovo can make a good computer, but this isn't one of them, at least mine isn't.\n\n**Conclusion -** I really wanted this to be good. It has massive potential to be the best X86 Windows machine with an LCD. But the buggy touchpad alone is a dealbreaker, not to mention the other quirks. Regardless, I'm not keen on trying a replacement. Will update the post if I manage to fix the trackpad or touchscreen before returning it.\n\n**Edit:** I clean installed Windows 11 today in hopes of fixing the trackpad issues. Only bare essential drivers installed. The system feels much faster now, and no random spinning blue wheel by the cursor, but the trackpad issue persists. Looks like it's going back.\n\n**Edit #2:** For those PWM or dithering sensitive, this section is for you. It seems the Aura causes pretty bad eye strain when used for over 20 to 30 minutes at time for me. The feeling is very similar to any modern MacBook, pressure in sinuses, headache, etc. It's likely temporal dithering, as the IPS panel is PWM free. It affects external monitors too, which points to the iGPU being the issue. 8 bit color depth from the default 10 in Intel control panel does not help. I tried using \"Ditherig\" software to disable dithering, and while it does have an effect on dithering / color banding, the strain remains.",
  "Wanted to come back to the thread and say I actually really like the Yoga Aura. No phantom touch for me. Trackpad works great. And no blue wheel issue. I also never turn on any \"send data analytics update\". So that might be what's causing the blue wheel. I daily drive with a MacBook Pro, and this is probably one of the best Mac equivalent in the windows world so far. Surface laptop 7 is great too, but I enjoy the higher resolution on the Aura and the worry free for compatibility issue.",
  "\\-- Update 03.08.25: The display started doing weird things, half of it goes dark and then comes back. Getting worse by the day. Also the hinge is starting to show worrying wear and tear. I don't do anything out of the ordinary with the laptop, quite the opposite, I take good care of it and goes into a backpack that is well padded. So not as sturdy as I initially thought. Another thing to note is that the warranty is not international, so I'll have to fix it out of my pocket and void the warranty, or make do with half the screen :/ --\n\n\n\nI'll leave my experience with it after a few days of use, coming from an xps 9500 btw.  \nI agree with there are too many things that separate this laptop from a great laptop. All in all it works well but I feel there is a con for every pro.\n\n\\- Build quality is good, it's super thin but sturdy, my only complain is the bleeding keyboard light. It's pretty anoying and looks dated. From a certain angle it shines straight to your eyes, and at night when you are watching something in bed it's really annoying. Also I thought I wouldn't mind that it can't be open with one finger but it takes away from the experience.\n\n\\- Display is really reflective. with a dark background it becomes a problem. I tried the g16 2024 and is way less reflective than this. The resolution and colors are really nice though and it reads well, also there is 0 light bleed. But oled is just miles better (again the g16). The contrast is good for an ips but the viewing angles could be better. When watching movie you want to be looking at it completely straight or the blacks become clearly grays.If it werent for the reflexions I would say it's a 8 out of 10, but it gets a 7.\n\n\\- keyboard: It's good (not thinkpad level). Other than the annoying lighting, I am more than satisfied.\n\n\\- Trackpad is ok. It works, but it freezes for a fraction of a second when you click, which is really annoying. It is also pretty loud, and a bit small for the times we live in. Serviceable but you miss the mouse.\n\n\\- Speakes: Meh. I recently tried the yoga pro 9i and those are awesome. The g16's are even better, they blow you away with their quality. These are ok unless except when you hear them side by side with some other good laptop speakers. even my old xps sounds better. They seem to sound good at first because of the base and the volume, but there is something in the sound that makes you want to stop the music or lower the volume after listening for 10 min. Sound signature is terrible, too much base, lacking mids, and ok highs. Also poor stereo separation. The music option in the dolby app produces the most pleasing sounds.\n\n\\- Performance: nice so far, pretty snappy. I didn't ask much of it yet though. Scrolling on the browser results in frequent stutters though. This is suprising because It was completely smooth on the G16 with the core ultra 9, which packs a weaker igpu.\n\n\\- Battery: I think is an old day no prob laptop, it's great.\n\n\\- Fan noise: It's being good so far, for simple tasks, even coding with copilot, I can't hear the fans. When you push it a bit they quickly come in, but they are not loud and they quickly stop again. For my use case is mostly silent.\n\nupdate: While the fans are not loud they have a pulsating very high pitch that drills into your ear when the laptop is raised.\n\n\\- Wifi: weak reception. In the same spot the g16 get's 400mb, this only gets 250mb. It's pretty dissapointing.\n\nI think it's a good laptop, just over 400€ overpriced (in Europe is 1700€ after taxes).",
  "Can someone who owns the laptop do me a massive favour (e.g. u/richb0y or u/Mammoth-Material3161, or u/AetherSprite970 if you still have the laptop) and see if the screen is visible while wearing polarized sunglasses? When viewing the screen with sunglasses on, it might be completely black, completely fine, or more dim (in this latter case, it'll probably be completely black if you tilt your head 45 degrees).\n\n  \nThe TL;DR of this is that the light emitted by LCD screens is polarized apparently, and if it's polarized horizontally it will be completely blocked by polarized sunglasses. If it's polarized vertically the screen will appear at full brightness with sunglasses on. \n\n  \nThanks so much!!",
  "Best review on this model out there. Those youtube reviewers should take notes.\n\nI returned mine as well for similar reasons. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Fans are very aggressive and run even if you open two chrome tabs and watch a youtube video. This applies even in battery saver mode. Fans are not quiet either.\n2. This is one of the first laptops that actually stays cool in lap and at worst gets warm but never hot to touch. So that single sided PCB and cooling is working. Battery life is easily 11 hours for Wifi youtube streaming.\n3. There is a blue spinning wheel next to mouse cursor that appears 75% of the time you are using laptop. I don't know if it is Lenovo's \"AI Core\" learning usage patterns or some other software/firmware bug but it makes you feel there is a malware or background windows updates at all times. And whenever there is something loading like a tab/video, you wonder if it is because of this or just the low power LNL chip.\n4. IPS Screen has 100% perfect colors but the overly reflective screen makes the blacks look brown and induces a \"glow\" at all times. Slightest change of angle and you get cloudy appearance in any dark part of the video/scene you are watching. For comparison, I have an X1 extreme from several years back and it has a matte IPS which has better blacks than this Aura! Also have an OLED laptop so a little spoiled when it comes to contrast/blacks.\n5. Build quality is good, not as good as XPS or Thinkpad, but very acceptable. The only Flex you get is towards the back on the bottom cover. Someone above mentioned the backlight gap being too big on function keys and I agree. Speakers are really good too but make sure Dolby Atmos is enabled for the best sound.\n6. Most tasks are snappy and you get quick responses when you open a file explorer window or a Chrome tab. However, if you have multiple windows open for streaming video I noticed that it is unable to keep streams active in all windows. You have to refresh the window/tab to reinitiate a stream. I am on 300Mbps connection and each stream is only 3Mbps max. I did not have this issue on my Proart but that uses a Mediatek WLAN card but both are Wifi 7.\n7. I have read several people had trackpad/touchpad becoming unresponsive issue (after a few mins of idling) but I didn't have this issue. I did do a clean Win11 install and was surprised that the trackpad or touchscreen did not work throughout the install!! I had to install the drivers for these to work which was a bit of a surprise. Another surprise was that the Blue spinning wheel issue came back on a fresh Windows install that had all Windows updates and drivers !! Not a fan of this spinning wheel and think it must be some Lenovo AI core thing in the background as there is a chip with this name inside the laptop!\n8. Full size 2280 M.2 single sided SSD barely fits in the laptop and even though I could close the bottom cover, I wouldn't recommend doing so as the 2242 SSD screw holder sits halfway and is very very close to the SSD surface and may even be touching slightly. Also, you DO feel very small bulge on the bottom cover after doing so. Probably that's why Lenovo didn't ship it with a 2280. I would rather get a TLC 2230 and extender.\n\nSo yes, very good slim/light laptop overall, 15.3\" screen size is perfect too, though I hope these spinning wheel, fan noise, trackpad issues are all software related and get a quick fix from Lenovo. But I returned mine and using the Proart P16 now instead.",

  "I using the slim 7i Aura since 3 weeks and didnt had any phantom touches and problems with the touchpad. also no blue wheel.  \nBut I had a couple of problems since then:\n\n\\- my right usb c port didnt work for a week or two. no charging, data transfer and video transfer. But since a week its working again and I didnt do any update or windows reinstalling\n\n\\- it happened 3-4 times that in standby mode the laptop didnt wake up again. even on pressing on the power button. So I had to force shutting it down.

Im considering a laptop with grafic card for casual gaming.\n\nMaybe someone has a recommendation?\n\nAlso is there a good solution with a anti flare screen protector and still possible using the touchscreen well?",
  "I just bought this a week ago and I was having issues with the laptop just locking up and freezing at random times. So I tried a clean Windows install using the drivers for my specific unit from Lenovo's support pages. Still, it continues to randomly lock up completely to the point that I can't do anything besides move the mouse around. I really like this laptop but this is not going to work for me.  I even thought maybe it was an Intel GPU driver issue so I grabbed the latest drivers form their site and still, it locks up.  I can return it until January 2025 so I might hold off in hopes that they release some better drivers.  \n\nOh and I do like the build quality except for the bottom panel that flexes way to much. They could have made it a bit thicker and it would have been much better. Every time I lift it up I can feel the bottom panel squeeze in.\n\nThanks for your review.",
  "As a recent buyer, who has been using the laptop for 3 weeks, I must say I disagree. The screen is great, vibrant and with great blacks, despite being a IPS screen. Yes it is glossy, but I haven't had any issues viewing content on this laptop.\n\nAudio is loud and audio quality is great.\n\nFor my moderate use of office meetings on Google Meet, Slack, Google workspace + 2 hours of average video streaming + Browsing, it usually lasts 8 hours when charged up to 80%. So, I only charge once a day. I am not a gamer or content editor.\n\nThe keyboard is great and the touchpad, although not haptic, is sensitive enough.\n\nThe performance is general is snappy. I do occasional programming, and I usually have 10 tabs open on browser + Slack. I see no lags in most cases. However, on a couple of occasions, I have found the browser got hung up. I am not sure if this was due to the laptop or the page that I was browsing. \n\nI have not encountered the blue mouse wheel either. \n\nLooks wise, this laptop is aesthetically great. Screen size and weight have a great balance in my opinion. Portability should not be a problem with this one.\n\nWindows Hello + some basic Lenovo AI stuff like detecting whether I have moved away from the laptop, are great features too.\n\nIf I had to criticise, I would say that the camera is just average.\n\nIn the UK, the price has dropped sub £1200...give a few months more...it will drop to £1100.",

  "I bought this laptop couple of weeks ago. While i'm generally happy with the performance, there are a few annoying things:\n\nI've never had a 3+ hour battery life on a windows laptop with near 0 overheating/fan noise. But with this laptop, I'm consistently getting 10+ hours of battery life with power saver on doing daily dev work + youtube running in the background, everything is snappy and responsive. I can also do some mild gaming- the only time the fan revs up.\n\nNo complaints with the speaker. they're very good- loud and clear even if a little bass heavy.\n\nThe screen is very good but it's too reflective. If you have a bright work space with a lot of windows, you'll be very quickly annoyed by how reflective the screen is. But if you're indoors and in low light, this is an excellent screen.\n\nbiggest issues:\n\nI have the ghost touch issue- mine appear when battery is low- around 20%. There seems to  be a constant touch action on the bottom right where the windows time/date thingie is. I've disabled the touch screen since I really don't use it that much.\n\nAnd I also have the trackpad/touchpad issue- It's almost like if I don't use it for a couple of minutes, it gets disabled and I have to try and wake it up by pressing the left mouse button and moving the cursor around. sometimes the cursor moves but tapping on it doesn't click anything. I have to press the physical button to force a click. then it works as long as I use it continuously. gets annoying real quick.\n\nThis could've been a perfect laptop except for the above issues. And if anyone has solved the above issues i'd like to know how to fix it. (I tried bloat removal and even windows reinstall but the issue still persists)",

  "Hello \n\nI am going to buy this laptop soon.\n\nIs there display glare problem a deal breaker?  \nSome people mentioned : glossy displays leading to poor battery life because you have to crank up brightness to max to combat glare.\n\nThanks",
  "Its not easy to buy a laptop nowadays. many models and there are issues on each model. No windows laptop is perfect it seems, unless you pay big amount to Thinkpad series highend one.",
  "Luckily the 15.3\" screen is the same size as the Macbook Air 15, so you could pick up a matte screen protector.",
  "[I just reviewed it](https://smbtech.au/features/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-aura-edition-laptop-review/) and got 26.5 hours. That's a new record on my site.",
  "After using for some time, I think it’s similar to surface laptop screen. It’s reflective but with decent resolution. Colors are vibrant. I mostly work inside so it’s been fine. Working outside might be slightly tough because the screen is pretty reflective (not as good coating as MacBook). If you turn up the brightness to 100% that might make it better for outside work.",
  "I think the same, if not even better.   So loud and clear and good bass too.   I've tested both the 14\" and the 15.3 and had zero issues.  I think the one this person is talking about was just a lemon",
  "Not really, I just got used to it.",
  "Barely but yes. You can be outside (in the shade of course) and make do while in light mode. It's a mirror though, so you gotta find the right angle.",
  "Thank you so much - I really appreciate it. This makes it a buy for me. ",
  "Glad I could help make that tough decision! Not many choices right now that are similar to Yoga 7i Aura Edition but hoping we get some new releases soon...",
  "I read about a couple folks mentioning unresponsive touchpad in some YouTube comments and in r/lenovo comments as well",
  "You probably don't need this anymore but its around 8 hours minimum for demanding stuff, WAY higher with regular use. Much more than one needs. If you plan on using it for several days in a row, just bring the charger.",
  "As I sit here looking at my non-upgradeable to Windows 11 Surface Book 2.  You felt and looked premium, I paid a lot for your middle tier processor, I learned what heat throttling was, sometimes you think the screen is disconnected when it isn't, we had a good run. No more MS laptops for me thanks.",
  "Just read it, some great detailed insights there. Definitely swaying me towards getting the SL7, especially given the low/no noise from the fans which is very important to me. Thanks for replying!",
  "How would you compare the screen reflectivity between the SL7 and the Aura? Still waiting for my Aura to arrive",
  "OK, thanks for trying, it is good to know that it is not compatible... by the way, there are several variants, depending on the model (eg 1 or 2 fans) : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qjlal2/tpfan_control_on_newer_thinkpads_share_your/\n\nOn the Aura, there is also a built-in BIOS configured power management, accessible through Fn+Q command : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1fufeoa/lenovo_yoga_slim_7i_aura_edition_ama/lqcjek5/",
  "What if you set the performance/fan mode to quiet? Does that make it quiet enough? I'm thinking of getting this too and have heard mixed reviews about fan noise",
  "Ya, it’s been hit or miss on battery life. Touchpad gets finicky w longer use, appears to be pretty sensitive to the oils on the skin and any grime so I try to use the mouse. I really do like the yoga mouse you can get for around $20. Ergonomic and accurate. Screen is my favorite part along with the keyboard. If the trackpad were the same as MacBook this would be a pretty near perfect machine. If you have the money and the time to wait I’d get the x1carbon w custom haptic pad not currently available for preorder. To save about 2k I live with the faults of the laptop as it does what I need. Portability is also really nice and feels slick in the hands. I do understand at night the irritation w the backlit keyboard and reflection on the screen due to the space in between the keys so I try to keep it on the low setting. No major issues thus far. Runs BlackOps 6 w no problem \n\nI do get random issues w headphones and Bluetooth but not sure if it’s the computer or the headphones. No problems at all when plugged in.",
  "Its actually not too bad in person (at best buy) when viewed side by side to the book 4 screen.   I think the book 5 screen has more anti-reflective coating and they did not have that model for testing.",
  "Is the reflection problem specific to touchscreen version or all version affected?",
  "Does anyone tried this?",
  "It had been on sales for £1100 for the Aura 258V 32GB RAM model in the UK (e.g. Lenovo Store, Currys).",
  "Yes the 32 GB version with Intel 258V. Seems like some of the discounts are now gone.",
  "I have the same ghost touch issue, sending it in for repair under warranty in 2 days.  \nhow was you experience with the repair and is it still working?  \nAsking since i have heard many bad things about Lenovo's repair service.",

  "I'm looking to replace an old Dell XPS 9360 laptop with the following specs: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz 2.00 GHz. If I had no eye strain issues with this, do you think I should be ok with the Slim 7i Aura?",
  "Tell me how the type of graphics card can affect eye strain. Eye strain and other discomforts are caused by PWM and temporal dithering. These are defects or characteristics of displays, and intervening components are unlikely to be the cause, but I could be wrong. Please comment.",
  "I exchanged it",
  "I mostly use my laptop indoor with low light so my brightness is usually around ~30%. so I can't tell you how long it lasts on full blast. The screen is very glossy though. if you work in a very bright room with bright background/light behind you, then yeah it can be very annoying to clearly see your reflection on the screen even at 80% brightness. it's depends see if you can find a sample in the nearest store.",
  "I like your little candy cane for scale",
  "Can you share me the settings that you have used while testing this and was there any major tweaks done to this? I got the same laptop but seems like my idle drain is little bit higher, although I did clean install of windows.",
  "Is it good?",
  "HP's new OmniBook Flip looks good, but its battery is a bit small. Maybe I'll wait for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Aura edition. It'll be very expensive at the release time though.",

  "Ah, interesting. Looks like a universal issue then.",
  "Both are glossy glass surfaces, but I remember the SL7 looked less reflective. The aura can look a bit mirror-like at times.",
  "My bluetooth is awful.  I can pair all devices, but they will NOT stay connected.  My earbuds connected, and I was able to use them for about 1 minute or so, but I could only get the Right side to receive sound.  There's something very very broken about the bluetooth on this machine.  It has been out since 2024, and it is shocking that it is still not fixed !!!  The internet is full of people with the same bluetooth issue.",
  "Yes, a few people on reddit shared their experience of this already. They said the outcome is comparable to the new M4 nano texture screen coating. Less reflection but more grainy, as you would expect.",

  "You could try to check if the problem is related to your Windows install, or a hardware issue (e.g. WiFi chip, antenna connection). \n\nOne relatively easy way would be to create a Linux bootable USB stick (e.g. Ubuntu). Boot up from the Linux USB stick and check the WiFi speeds. \n\nIf the speeds in Linux are normal, you could then try a \"clean install\" of Windows (download Windows USB install media from Microsoft website).\n\nIf the WiFi speed in Linux is also very low, then it might be worth opening up the laptop and checking the WiFi chip and antennas (does not void warranty). Ask a friend if you don't know how to check this, or follow a YouTube tutorial.",
  "I have a ThinkPad with the same CPU (8650u). I find it pretty similar to modern AMD laptops, moderate strain after 1-2 hours. Much better than modern Intel Xe, which the Aura has.\n\nI would give it a shot, you can always return.",

  "Yeah, for some reason it worked fine for me or maybe I just didn't notice it. I think a few BIOS updates can fix some of these pesky annoying issues in otherwise an ideal laptop.",
  "Now I'm thinking to just get the Yoga Pro 9i with the IPS. Should check all the boxes. Just not the battery life",
  "It is a glossy screen, so some glare is there, but not anything significant to be a deal breaker. Battery life has been excellent so far, usually lasts 5 to 8 hours on a single charge of 80%.",
  "Thank you for these suggestions, and I think I will try it. Can you please provide me with a link to such a Linux Bootable Stick download? I know I can search for it, but I feel you can provide me with a tested (and safe) solution.\n\nmeanwhile I found an acceptable solution using a tp-link wifi dongle",

  "You're welcome. I made it as part of my Aura review, [here](https://smbtech.au/news/datadog-showcases-expanded-ai-ml-and-aws-monitoring-features-at-reinvent/).",
  "If it's dropped like that again it will be Number 1, or very near it. Prices are a rollercoaster at this time of year and there's not much in it. There's a whisker between these and choosing what suits you best will leave you with a great laptop either way.",
  "The 9i looks like a nice machine especially with mini-LED, but the chassis is quite cheaply made, like the Pro 7. All plastic interior, including the hinge assembly.

Compare that to a full CNC MacBook Pro chassis, or even SL7, XPS, etc. Even the Aura is built better.\n\nI've heard good things about the 9i, but I would be careful with the hinge. I suppose if it breaks you can buy a replacement chassis from Lenovo, they are pretty good at stocking parts. But you shouldn't have to for $2k.",

So you may have to try the links a few times. \n\nIf you have good WiFi speeds with an external USB WiFi dongle then this is also indicative of a hardware issue. I suggest you find a friend who can help you check out the WiFi inside your laptop.",
  "For the benchmarks, i go for the max possible score. I'll have Windows Set to Best Power efficiency and the Vendor's app set to maximum efficiency (no overclocking, USB charging turned off, silent mode if not low power, disable diacreet GPU if relevant etc).

  "hi I am someone using this laptop for a month. Idk if it's too late by the time you read this but here's my experience.\n\nThe battery life for me is excellent - provided you don't have power-hungry startup apps like Discord, Logitech software or Steam. Spotify counts too but tbh I don't find it that much of a drain.\n\nMy use case has been browsing online, excel/word, watching videos / spotify - the battery easily lasts for 12 hours.  Usually with the aforementioned use case of doing all that at the same time (video essay / spotify on background and then the other apps) I can hit like 50% mark after 5-6 hours.\n\nI didn't really go too crazy, I just set the lenovo vantage profile to the intelligent mode (the neutral one, not performance or batt saving) and it's been working wonderfully. Vantage is actually my fav tool now - after getting burnt by Asus' MyAsus app that didn't do shit to help with batt life.\n\nAdditional:\n\n\\- screen at 50% (the new 14 inch version is now OLED as opposed to IPS so if you wanna go for the smaller version do take note the batt life may be diff even though spec-for-spec it's very similar to this 15 inch ver)\n\n\\- no backlight keys (lowkey sucks there's not much levels of adjustment - just low or high)\n\n\\- reduce screen refresh to 60hz (honestly 120hz is overrated for something like a laptop imo. I have a desktop that goes 165hz and that's more for gaming. sure it's smooth and all but eh not worth the batt life tradeoff).\n\nif you realllly wanna stretch the life, use MS edge as ur browser cuz that's the least battery draining browser out there.

Unfortunately, she decided return the laptop after just one week as the case kept splitting open at the front under the touchpad. This indicates some poor built quality. I tried it out myself for a bit and also found the feeling and aesthetics rather on the cheap and plasticky side. The system also felt very sluggish and performed poorly in everyday web browsing and office tasks.\n\nAfter the MSI Prestige, I recommended my friend to get a full aluminium Lenovo Yoga 7i 14\" instead. She's very happy with the Yoga laptop's sturdy built quality, and it feels a lot snappier to her, too.",

However, if it is a mistake and it lets you place the order, it's possible that they might still honor the purchase and just eat the loss as a result of their mistake and still send it to you.

  "Most likely true. I work at a very large company and work in picking and shipping orders, and it's generally the same for every company. If a product is in stock and is purchased, the order is automatically added to the queue and dropped in the next wave of orders for the warehouse workers to pick and ship it. \n\nMany times the packlist/order receipt will show the total price of the order, but nobody really pays attention and even if a warehouse grunt sees it, they will assume nothing and still send it out. No managers or financial workers will see the order until well after it is shipped and delivered in most cases",
  "I have worked at a popular grocery store for over a decade. In the U.S. if a store has a price sign in front of a product that indicates an incorrect price, we have to honor it. Otherwise it’s called bait and switch. I have no idea how this is handled online or internationally however.",
  "They don’t. Law undergraduate here. This falls under contract law. A website listing or product is considered as an **invitation to treat**, and not an **offer**. To define an offer, I will quote it from the case of Preston Corpn Sdn Bhd v Edward Leong: An offer is an intimation of willingness by an offeror to enter into a legally binding contract. Its terms either expressly or impliedly must **indicate** that it is to **become binding on the offeror** (buyer) assoon as it has been **accepted by the offeree** (seller).\n\nEven if the customer were to send an offer (by checking out), a **binding contract** is not yet formed because Lenovo has yet to accept that offer and they can choose to back out as there is no **legally enforceable agreement** yet. (A confirmation email is also not signifying of acceptance of order!)\n\nA similar example to this would be Chwee Kin Keong v Digiland Mall Pte Ltd. TLDR is that an employee keyed in a pricing for a product at $66 instead of $3,854 (MSRP) and the company obviously didn’t want to fulfil orders that were made and got taken to court. Court ruled in the company’s favour.\n\nIn consumer court, courts do consistently rule in favour of the seller during obvious pricing mistakes like a $1 phone etc. because they take the view of a **reasonable person in consideration and apply the objectivity test**. \n\nFor example, in this case, the court said:\n“I find ... that the plaintiffs, given each of their backgrounds, would in any event, each have separately realised and appreciated, before placing their purchase orders,that a manifest mistake had occurred – even if no communications on the error had taken place between them. Further, the character of the mistake was such that **any reasonable person** similarly circumstanced as each of the plaintiffs would have had every reason to believe that a manifest error had occurred.” . \n\nOtherwise, the court would also simply treat it as a **clerical or unilateral mistake** and not punish the seller. Similarly in this case, Lenovo would win.\n\nIf there’s any Law graduates reading this and want to improve on my stand, please do! I’m still studying and open to improvement",
  "Nope where it's clearly a mistake and you know it, they don't need to honour it",
  "They are not and three seconds of googling will support that. Just because you once managed to slip one through doesn’t mean that’s the law.\n\nImagine a computer store mislabelling a €4000 laptop at €1 and a large amount of units are ordered overnight while nobody’s at work. Your argument is that EU law now effectively forces this company into bankruptcy by being required to honor these sales that were clearly made exploiting an error in pricing?",
  "No....",
  "Depends on the Ts and Cs",
  "Yeah.... depends on if that's enforceable to a website in another country.... Much like the GDPR fines the EU charges.... a US website isn't subject to that....  even if they decide to keep data on you... because they're not breaking THEIR laws.",

Like imagine if disc.google.com could be swapped by something malicious? \n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but aren't sites check response and then send info about a site, judging from 1) the subdomain, 2) the page (/in) and then parse arguments passed in the url if there are any? It's server-client thing – client sends response (get/post etc.), site's backend transfers specific data to the client (rendering the page if needed and so on). Done.",

  "True, but I was just giving an example to explain. However, if we look at it in layman terms, the universal legal principle will be the same. You simply cannot reasonably expect to enforce a contract based on a price that is **obviously an error**. So in any jurisdiction, I’m highly confident that Lenovo would win should this be taken to court. \n\nIf you search up similar topics, you will find that across common law (Singapore, UK, US) and civil law (France, Germany, EU), the courts follow the same reasoning:\n1.\tObvious pricing errors = no binding contract.\n2.\tBuyers cannot exploit a mistake they recognize.\n3.\tThe worst that happens to the retailer is refunding the money.\n\nHowever, if we are referring to say, a $599 MSRP laptop being listed erroneously at $499, the court may order the seller to honor some of the orders, which has happened in many jurisdictions before, since borderline errors (e.g., 10–25% off normal price) can be interpreted as a discount/promotion and would lead a reasonable person to believe that there is no mistake in pricing.\n\nIn this case though, it’s a laptop for $1. So it’s pretty obvious and no court would side with the buyer.",
  "Incorrect.\nTL;DR Lenovo (and most other companies) explicitly states that a confirmation email does **NOT** signify acceptance of the order. **No acceptance = No contract.** (This clause is commonplace for every business) Consumer will lose if he tries to go to court, even if he has the best lawyer. Below, I will cite Lenovo.\n\n**Full explanation:**\n\nA confirmation email, if you dig deep into any businesses’s Terms and Conditions (the thing that everyone ignores), has built in protective clauses in their Terms of Sale, and they’re not obliged to provide the consumer with any goods or service with a confirmation email alone. **Confirmation email ≠ acceptance.** A confirmation email only signifies that they have **received** the order.\n\nHere, I will specifically cite for this case, Lenovo. Under their T&Cs, it clearly states that **a confirmation of Lenovo receiving and/or processing your order does not constitute acceptance of the order.** (1.2)\n\nSource: https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/legal/new-products-and-warranty-services/?srsltid=AfmBOop9YcXqtlgbWWSEtLd4WCy7paTFtCMABKIs8xZmfYyPvIBRyTbc&ut\n\nIt also states under 1.1 that:\n\n1.1) **No contract** for the purchase of Products or Services will be formed until Lenovo accepts your Order by **one of the following**:\n\n**(a)** shipping the hardware Product and sending you a shipment confirmation email; or\n\n**(b)** making the software Product available to you; or\n\n**(c)** providing the Service to you.\n\nTherefore, that confirmation email is **not a binding acceptance** and is more of an acknowledgment that they’ve received your order and are processing it. Until shipping occurs (or software is delivered, etc.), Lenovo **reserves the right** to cancel or adjust your order **even if** you’ve already received a confirmation email or any other form of confirmation.\n\nI personally think that TV shows these days make the law seem very shallow to the average person, like; “Little guy sues company and wins!”. \n\nThe reality is, that every business has multiple built in protective and failsafe clauses layered into their contracts etc. to make sure that real consumers **will never win against them** in court. I feel like the average person should read more into the T&Cs so they know what they’re getting themselves into, but we don’t, so companies take advantage of that; and that is why we have lawyers :)",

  "No coil whine and I don't believe this one has liquid metal, so no leakage issues there. Overall, it's been great. The build quality is pretty solid, but it's not as good as the MacBook or the Razer Blade I had. However, Razer got rid of the glass on their displays, which has led to them feeling lower quality to me, and lesser in comparison to the Macs that still use glass. The bottom panel is a cheap plastic one which again, feels lesser in quality vs those other two, but it's not something I notice in my regular usage because it's either docked or on a desk and then going in and out of a bag. \n\nIt has a minor issue on the trackpad, but it's still very usable, just annoying. Since I rarely use the trackpad and use external M&K when at home, or a mouse and the built-in keyboard while traveling, it's not a big deal. \n\nPerformance-wise, I'm still able to max out all of my games on absolutely Ultra settings including Path Tracing on Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2 with good frame rates on my external 34\" Ultrawide. When playing on the 2560x1600 internal display, performance is obviously even better. \n\nI bought this because I needed the absolute most power possible in the lightest, most portable package possible. I traveled for work weekly for the past few years, and I travel regularly, so having this has been a godsend. I remember playing Warzone in LaGuardia at one of the bars when my flight got delayed and blowing off steam was great. I took this to QuakeCon for 3 years now, and the ability to pack more power than my desktop into something that fits in my backpack is amazing.  \n\nComing from a Mac, probably your biggest hurdle is going to be battery life, but the latest CPUs are supposedly much better in that regard (though we hear that every generation so YMMV).",

I'm considering a Thinkpad, even if with a less powerful CPU, but I haven't seen the newer generations, they may just as well not be the same quality as the older ones...",
  "Hi,\n\nYes, I ended up buying it because I could no longer bear all the browsing and comparing and reading reviews... :)\n\nI had used Thinkpads before, and a year ago I had bought the Ideapad 1 for my daughter to use as her first laptop in school, so I was not totally unfamiliar with Lenovo laptops.\n\nWhat can I say, it is kind of what I expected, build quality seems decent, with an aluminium lid, solid plastic/PCB for the rest of the body, and yes, it is very slim, at least compared to what I had been used to. It doesn't look cheap, I got it in Luna Grey, and it's a very nice metallic color, making it look more expensive than it is.\n\nThe display is the regular WUXGA 1920x1200 which for me is perfect in such a compact form factor (it is a 15.3\" display - which I appreciate for portability, while still offering plenty of space for work thanks to its 16:10 ratio). It is \"only\" 300 nits bright, some people complained about it being too dim for them, but I found it perfectly fine, I use it comfortably at 70-75% brightness (my desktop Dell monitor is only 250 nits and it it is still bright enough!)\n\nPerformance-wise it is as expected from a Ryzen 7 8840HS - snappy in all tasks, it won't get hot with regular office work, browsing, watching videos, etc. So far, so good. The fan only starts with some heavy multitasking, such as downloading and installing a large game while also running online tv in the background and working in Office at the same time... but even so, the fan is not loud at all, you can barely hear it.\n\nI've tested it in some games too, again.. it performs as expected, the integrated Radeon 780M is excellent for \"laptop gaming\", it runs games like Syrim, Fallout New Vegas, etc. perfectly smooth in 1080p (or 1200p for that matter). Of course the very slim case is not optimal for cooling, so for extended gaming, even moderate, I would suggest an additional cooler pad/stand. \n\nOtherwise, I'm pretty happy with it, no issues so far.. if I were to be really picky, I'd say the keyboard could be better, it feels a bit soft for my taste, somewhat rubbery. But the backlight is really useful in dark conditions, and I knew I shouldn't expect a \"Thinkpad level keyboard\". I often work on an external monitor, using an external keyboard, so that is not a serious issue for me anyway.\n\nShortly after I bought it, the price was discounted and I could have gotten the 24GB RAM version instead of the 16GB version, for the same price, but I didn't bother trying to return it and order the one with more RAM, I intend to upgrade it to more than 24GB anyway. I intend to add a 32GB DDR5 stick (in addition to the 8GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard) - a total of 40GB should be plenty for the next few years - the added RAM will really be necessary (especially with the integrated GPU), so I would recommend getting the one with more RAM if you don't plan to upgrade it yourself later.\n\n(I would post photos, but I don't think it's possible here.)",
  "The max it can use is 4GB, I don't think you can change that in BIOS (I don't remember seeing any options related to vram allocation). \n\nIn the meantime I upgraded mine to 24GB RAM (8 soldered + a 16GB DDR5 5600MHz stick). Running Task Manager I can see there are always a total of 20GB available for system, thus the rest of 4GB is reserved for the GPU, which is allocated dynamically in games as needed (you can see all those stats live using the in-game overlay provided by the AMD Adrenalin software).",
  "It's not a heavy duty workstation, it's not meant to be \"overloaded\" with work. For regular office work, for students and even for some light-medium gaming it does work well, it doesn't feel sluggish at all. After all, it is an 8 cores, 16 threads, 5.1 GHz boost clock CPU! And the RAM is DDR5 running at 5600MHz! So it's by no means a slow machine, but you really have unrealistic expectations, what does \"value for money\" mean in this case? The performance of a $3,000 laptop in one that costs $600?\n\nThere are two battery versions available for this model, I went for the higher capacity one (60Whr). Coupled with a low TDP of the CPU (only 28W!), the battery really lasts more than many laptops I owned before.",
  "It depends... which Ryzen 5 CPU? The \"U\" versions of the Ryzen 5 CPUs are cheaper (but also slower, such as Ryzen 5 5625U).\n\nAnd what display? The regular IPS lcd, OLED...?\n\nBut £450 seems a bit expensive, for instance I found this configuration online in my country for about £350 (with further 10% off these days):\n\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15ARP10\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 7533HS (up to 4.4GHz)\n\n15.3\" WUXGA, IPS\n\n16GB DDR5\n\n512GB SSD\n\nI'm pretty sure it does the job for uni, office work, etc.\n\n  \nP.S> Oh, and do go for the highest RAM version (I think they come with a maximum of 24GB), it will help a lot for the future, even if all you do is regular work and study, Windows itself and other software are becoming more and more demanding in terms of memory. The price difference is not that much.\n\n#",
  "Hi, mine is the 60 Wh battery (they larger capacity one) and while I haven't used it exclusively on battery yet, from full to empty, it always shows an estimate of 6-7 hours when I unplug it at full charge. It automatically switches to another power plan for better battery life, which you can adjust further manually for even more battery saving, but I guess it also depends on what kind of work you're doing on your laptop while running on battery and the brightness you set for the display. I'd say you can definitely rely on approximately 6 hours of normal office work, browsing, etc. No gaming on battery, obviously.",
  "I only use it occasionally, when I travel or when I spend the weekend away from home and so. No issues so far, it is (obviously) faster than my desktop's i5-9500 / 32GBRAM and I've even played some games, I happy with the performance and the compact size. I've adjusted the display colors to a cooler temperature as the \"built-in\" blue light protection makes the colors slightly too warm by default.",
  "way better. the steam deck has 4 zen2 cores at max 3.5ghz with a 8cu rdna2 igpu, the 8840hs has 8 zen 4 cores at max 5.1ghz with a 16cu 780m rdna3 igpu. also higher tdp",

  "Just as bad, the hinges in Ideapads 1 and 3 are painfully weak, also tbh not that many laptops can compare to Thinkpad in terms of reliability.

  "Hi man thanks for the review.About Display did you find it to have a yellowish tint as many say?!",
  "How are the thermals? What temperature does the cpu reach while playing?",
  "Hi, the display does show a slightly warm/yellowish tint overall, particularly noticeable with reds - they look somewhat orange, I suspect it's the so called blue light filter built in, but I used the Adrenalin software for the integrated GPU and managed to get reasonably neutral/cooler colors, it now looks similar to my desktop monitor, but if you are a perfectionist, you may need to invest more. But to me, it's not a bad display at all.",
  "What do you think about the new Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Gen 10?  Ryzen AI 7 350, OLED and 32Gb RAM for 900€ ",
  "I have one but with sadly a ryzen 7 7735hs and not an AI 7 350. But I have all maxed out options.\n\nIt's an absolute BANGER of a laptop. It's very light and thin, build quality is pretty good and the OLED is really bright. \n\nPerformance wise it performs as you'd expect from the specs as far as mine is concerned, but i can't tell for the RAI7 version obviously. \n\nKeyboard is good as well. The integrated microphone is *extremely* good for a laptop, hands down best laptop mic I've heard. I'm running Linux on it, it's very well supported and everything works as expected except the mic which needs a kernel edit to work (I've sent a patch a month or so ago, but i think it got forgotten :/ )\n\nIn the bios you can dedicate from 256mb to 4gb to the igpu. However the bios is fairly limited in terms of what you can do in it.\n\nNow that I know the ryzen ai 7 version exists I'm sad I didn't wait :( \n\nOh and one last thing, at least with mine I bundled a 2year accidental damage warranty for 35€ which is nice, idk if that's still available but it's a nice to know.",

  "Old ones okay maybe if decently priced. Problem are new ones, being super overpriced while offering very little. An example : A mid range T14 G5 with a core ultra 5 125U, 60hz 1200p sRGB IPS display, 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage, which for those two are getting below today's standard, is priced at 1200€. Those are specs you'd find on a 600-700€ laptop, not a 1200€ laptop. At 1000€ you can already get something well built with a Ryzen 7 8th gen, 32gb of ram and 1tb of storage (Asus Zenbook, HP Elitebook, etc). In this case that laptop OP showed was a pretty fine deal, but if you took a Thinkpad for the same price you'd have an E14 Gen 6 with even worse specs. They stay good, don't get me wrong : but at any price range there's pretty much always a better deal.",

  "Keyboard's alright. As for the burn in, I think it'll be fine, especially if you don't run max brightness (the screen is very bright, even half brightness is much brighter than most laptop screens) and auto hide taskbar. Bonus point if you use a OLED friendly theme (iirc the O365 suite has one where the background and ui is pure black). Those are only preventive measures and not really 100% necessary unless you're really scared.",

  "Strangely it's hard to find an 8845hs or 8840u ddr5, good battery life + screen laptop here in India without overpaying a lot. \nBut I found an almost equally good Ryzen 7 AI 350 laptop with 860M igpu, 32 GB ddr5 5600 MT, 60wh fast charge. I think that'll be almost equally good as your laptop?",
  "so the intel would be the better choice ? between it doesn't have the multi threading capabilities, that's why i hesitate",
  "The ai 7 350 has a weaker iGPU but is normally slightly better than the 8845hs, would be close or even better since it also consumes less.",

  "Lenovo Yoga 7i Gen10, 14-inch laptop (2025) review **UK-based Laptop Review**\n\n**1. Title:**  \nLenovo Yoga 7i Gen 10 (2025) Review: power and portability\n\n**2. Introduction:**\n\nThis is a review for the 2025 yoga 7i gen 10 model from Lenovo with intel core ultra 7 258v and 14 inch screen. I bought the configuration from the UK Lenovo website with 32GB RAM, 1TB SDD, 2.8k OLED 120Hz screen, Luna Grey colour and optioned the fingerprint scanner for an additional £10, paying £1090 in total (including the 10% VIP discount for healthcare workers). This is a premium grade 2-in-1 consumer laptop with a solid build, great for anyone who needs a portable and powerful device.\n\nI haven’t seen many user reviews for this particular generation of laptop so thought it would be useful for anyone considering it.\n\n**3. Design and Build Quality:**\n\nThe chassis all metal, which gives it a very solid feel. The build quality is great, there’s very little flex in the case or the keyboard. The body does not pick up fingerprints. At 1.4kg, it’s not the lightest laptop but it’s still very portable. It fits my 13 inch laptop sleeve. I don’t have much use for the tablet mode as I find it too cumbersome when compared with holding an actual tablet. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and the trackpad is smooth and accurate. I appreciate the double height enter key. Coming from the LG gram 16, this is a much better typing and trackpad experience.\n\nPort selection is good. There are 2 USB-C ports, one on either side, with one USB-A, one full-sized HDMI, a microSD card slot and a headphone jack. The power key is on the right side which I’ve mis-pressed a couple of times so I’ve disabled it in the settings.\n\nThe display is a 14-inch glossy OLED touchscreen with 2.8K resolution (2880 x 1800), 500 nits brightness (1100 nits HDR Peak). I find the screen bright and vibrant. Watching video in a dimmed room is fantastic with zero light bleed. Reflections and fingerprints can be an issue, especially when viewing dark things on the screen and there is bright ambient. However it is still useable under these conditions.\n\nThe hinges are solid, with little screen wobble when typing but it does require two hands to open the lid. The look and feel of the laptop is very nice with smooth rounded outer edges.\n\n**4. Performance and heat:**\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 258v is perfectly capable of handling my usual tasks of multiple Chrome/ Firefox tabs, connecting to my remote desktop for work and steaming video content.  I have tried some gaming and the experience with casual  games has been very good. Fortnite runs at 120FPS. Cities Skylines runs great. I’ve tried playing Watchdogs and although it could play it, the framerates were only around 40fps and the processor got quite hot with the fans getting noisy.\n\nThe keyboard and palm rest areas are always cool. The area under the screen gets warm under load but the hot air is blown out through the vents on the back, away from the user which is a good design.\n\n**5. Audio and Webcam:**\n\nThe speakers are fine, they are up firing from the sides of the keyboard and they are rated for Dolby Atmos. I can clearly hear the 3D effects when watching YouTube or Netflix. There isn't much bass but it is acceptable for a thin and light laptop.\n\nThe 5M IR camera is decent for video conferencing. There is a privacy shutter switch just above the camera. Windows Hello usually takes just a few seconds to log me in. I have found the fingerprint scanner works faster, especially when the lighting conditions are not ideal for Windows Hello.\n\n**6. Battery Life:**\n\nThe 70WHr battery lasts all day for me when web browsing/ streaming videos. I use a 100W Ugreen 4-port USB C charger to charge all my devices and the laptop fully charges within a couple of hours.  \n\n**7. Software and User Experience:**\n\nThe OS is Windows 11 Home 64 and comes with some minor bloatware including McAffee Antivirus, Lenovo support/ vantage/ AI shenanigans. The Lenovo Vantage software has some useful features including dimming various parts of the screen to save battery – I only use the taskbar dimming though as I find the background dimming too distracting. It also enables you to switch the laptop on just by lifting the lid, which means the much maligned side power switch is hardly ever used. There have been reports of this power button breaking easily on other models and thus bricking the device.\n\n**8. Price and Value:**\n\nThe base model costs £1000 (£900 for students or those that qualify for VIP member) and comes with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and a14inch WUXGA OLED screen (1920x1200, 400nits, 60Hz). I was happy to pay the \\~£200 premium for the better spec’d screen with double the RAM and SSD. Mine came with a 65W USB-C charger and a stylus pen which magnetically attaches to the lid.\n\n**9. Pros and Cons:**\n\n* **Pros:** Screen, performance, battery life, keyboard\n* **Cons:** Screen reflections, power key positioning.\n\n**10. Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a well-built laptop where the pros far out-weigh the cons. The OLED screen is fantastic and it has been a pleasure watching content in a darkened room. It is very easy to travel with, having all-day battery life and a thin and light form factor.\n\n**Final Rating:** 9/10",
  "Really nice post.\n\nIm looking into this as pretty much the only option as the price is really good compared to others.\n\nIm sceptical about the hinges, but you say they are fine. And also if the performance is okay, if i could spec it id go higher but there arent really any options. \n\nThe next thing is vivobook which goes about 50% more with worse screen",

  "Hi, I’ve used a Lenovo Yoga 7 AMD from a few generations back with the Ryzen 6800U for the past 3 years and have had no issues with the hinges for what it’s worth!",
  "Thanks. Only time will tell regarding the hinges but they look and feel sturdy to me and these double hinge designs should in theory spread the force out across the 4 contact points on each hinge, reducing the stress at any one point. I'll update if I have any problems with the hinges",
  "It doesn't feel heavy but it's not feather-light like the LG gram. The LG gram can be lifted from a corner with one hand easily whereas I'd struggle to do this with the Yoga 7i. The Yoga 7i   feels more substantial, more premium. However it is still easy to carry around in a back pack.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase so far - it does everything I need and I feel it is good value for what you get compared to an equivalent from HP or Apple. As long as I keep the battery in good condition and the hinges don't break, I'm sure it'll last a good 3-5 years. \n\nIf I didn't play PC games, I would have strongly considered a macbook air 13\".",

  "Whats the thought behind charging to 80% - does this extend overall battery life long-term?",

I wouldn't expect to be able to run the latest AAA 3D intensive games well, but it can run most of them on low settings but I wouldn't recommend it for that as the fan noise gets quite loud if pushed too hard.",

  "I've used the laptop for a few months now and on the rare occasion that I do need to use the side power button (maybe twice so far), it's worked as it should. I think if the usage of the power button is so low, it should easily last the entire life of the laptop",

  "Laptop comparison: Zenbook14 (amd) vs Yoga slim 7 intel vs Yoga slim 7 gen 10(amd) I just graduated and am planning on buying my second laptop. I am considering either a ZenBook from Asus or Yoga from Lenovo. I will probably receive a work laptop so I need a laptop for normal browsing, maybe upskilling, movies and I play Genshin Impact consistently. once in a while i might play valorant, basically light gaming. I would prefer a 16GB RAM and 1TB storage. 512GB is also fine if other features are good. looking for a laptop with OLED Screen.\n\nI have 3 options that I really like:\n\n**1. ZenBook 14 OLED(2025) :  89,990 Rs**  \n[ZenBook 14 OLED](https://in.store.asus.com/ai-powered-light-weight-laptop-asus-zenbook-14-um3406ka-pp240ws.html)\n\nI really like this laptop and wanted a ZenBook for quite some time. I love everything about this laptop - the color, build, display quality. The amd version of this was released in India a few days ago. It has Ryzen AI 5 340 Processor which i know is quite good. Only downside is its 1TB Version is not yet available in India and I am not sure if it will be released any time soon too. I will have to pay extra for warranty too.\n\n**2. Yoga Slim 7 Gen 10 - AMD AI : 81,275 Rs**  \n[Lenovo Yoga slim 7 Gen 10](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-s-series/lenovo-yoga-slim-7-gen-10-14-inch-amd/83jycto1wwin1)\n\nThis also comes with Ryzen AI 5 340 Processor same as ZenBook. But the display of this laptop is not as good as ZenBook. looks wise i like ZenBook more but this is pretty good too. If i customize this laptop then the cost increases as:\n\n* \\+4000Rs Warranties that are automatically added \n* \\+2000Rs Microsoft office extra\n* \\+4900Rs for 1TB Storage\n* \\+4200Rs for Ryzen AI 7 350\n* \\+3850Rs for *35.56cms (14) 2.8K (2880 x 1800), OLED, Glare, Non-Touch, HDR 1000 True Black, 100%DCI-P3, 1100 nits (HDR Peak)/500 nits (SDR Typical), 120Hz*\n\nThe cost might go upto 93k - 99k depending on the combo. I don't know if Lenovo custom laptops are good cause one of my friends told me something negative about them.\n\nThese 2 are my top options.\n\n**3.** **Yoga Slim 7 Intel, 35.56cms - Core Ultra 5: 79,491 Rs**  \n[Yoga slim 7 Intel Ultra Core](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-s-series/yoga-slim-7i-gen-9-14-inch-intel/83cv008lin)\n\nThe intel version of the 2nd laptop. I was planning on going with amd but this laptop looked pretty good. This one has Ultra 5 125H Processor and its 1TB. I can customize it to Ultra 7 155H processor for extra 15k but then i have to pay extra for warranties and Microsoft Office too. Total would come around 97k.\n\nThese 3 are my major options. Should i consider Ideapads or vivobooks? Please help me with it.",

  "Would you get a macbook air m4 over Lenovo Legion 5i? Been thinking about this for a month now and haven’t decided yet. I do 3D modeling and my pc gave up. I also use multiple tabs of tiktok, IG, and other socials since I do source content creators with heavy formats google sheets.\n\nI’ve found a quite a good deal for the m4 air with 16gb unified memory and 512gb for 63k pesos, thinking I could also build a pc set up for 50k pesos if I bought the macbook. However if I go for the Legion I will spend around 86k pesos with rtx 5060 ryzen 7.\n\nWould buying the Macbook m4 air be enough? Or should I buy macbook + pc combo. Or just stick with the lenovo legion as my desktop and laptop.\n\nThank you for your opinion in advance!\nPS: my currency is Philippine Peso",
  "MacBook is going to perform way better in anything productivity related and battery life is going to obliterate any non MacBook laptop there is. Also the build quality is so much better than any gaming laptop, and indeed those Legion laptops suck in terms of both portability or build quality",
  "I was with a similar decision a few years ago, I decided for an rtx 4050 laptop to just do everything. It was a huge mistake, gaming laptops are generally heavy, battery life sucks and have a huge power brick. I travel a lot for work so it became a huge pain to use, plus the screen was just FHD. Now I have a macbook air m4, and man it is much more pleasant to use, text looks crisp thanks to the high resolution, and I barely have to charge it every few days. Plus, it is easy to carry around.\n\nMy opinion: get a macbook air for productivity, and a dedicated gaming device (pc or console) just check if the 3d modeling you want to do will be good enough on the air. I just sold my gaming laptop, I will be probably waiting for the steam machine. Macbook air isn´t bad for some light gaming though.",
  "I think the MacBook can do the 3d models, question is could you bump the memory and come in closer to the Lenovo.\n\n\nIssue with the Lenovo, you know what your walking into the battery life will be half of the mb, I believe you can charge it by usb c and if you have a decent charger brick you should be fine. But the vram on the Lenovo you want more than 8gb or you could run into issues with exporting and models and games. You could with the MacBook also but 24gb can help resolve that. \n\n\nMy thing would be should I rebuild the pc, spend some extra on a good tablet with keyboard setup for portable travel.. Idk your use case. But id take a mb over Lenovo with 8gb vram. 12gb vram I might would take the Lenovo. \n\n\nBut also pc + tablet.. ",

  "Did I Make a Huge Mistake? Lenovo Slim 3 vs ASUS TUF A15 — Need Advice! I just bought a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15AMN8. My goal was to get a professional 14' laptop for work, but one that could also handle games like PES 21, FIFA 23, and maybe  eFootball 2026 and the FIFA 2026 for  online play( I wanna have options) . I’m not a heavy gamer, I mainly played eFootball on mobile, but I got tired of the gameplay and decided to switch to a laptop.\n\nThe Lenovo Slim 3 cost me €528, plus a warranty that brought it to around €700. However, I started second-guessing my choice when I saw the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 priced at €869. I want a laptop that still looks professional for work, but I wouldn’t mind paying the extra €270 for noticeably better performance. The specs of the ASUS A15 are shown in the second photo.\n\nWhat do you all think? Did I make the right choice with the Lenovo, or should I return it and go for the ASUS TUF A15 instead?

  "Lenovo Yoga 7 with AMD - good or bad option? My bad if I mess something up on this post, I have to do it on my phone and it's late lol.\nNot too familiar with Yogas; are they decent? My main worry with a Lenovo is that the last one I got, I ended up returning it because it ran into a TON of issues within a week of barely using it - BSOD for no reason, wouldn't correct to wifi after initial updates, delayed keyboard feedback, stuff like that. It was an IdeaPad though, and those are trash anyways (I dunno what I was thinking, getting it in the first place, tbh).\nLooking to get something that'll work for me in college. I am taking art classes and a touch screen laptop would be great. If this, the Yoga, is junk, what else should I look at? Thought about Samsung, but I'm also rather unfamiliar with those too. Are they better for drawing and general school work? Was looking at the 360 ones, but I was a tad worried about the glass screen (hopefully I'm thinking of the right thing) cause I tend to damage things just by looking at them, somehow. \n\nSoooooo. Steer clear of Lenovo, or do I just buy it while it's on sale? College starts next week and while I CAN use the dumb Chromebooks they let students borrow, I REALLLLLY hate drawing with a mouse :)\n\nLink: https://www.bestbuy.com/product/lenovo-yoga-7-2-in-1-16-2k-touchscreen-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-8840hs-with-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-artic-grey/JJGSHX8YFG",

Then again, quality control vary everywhere, I have good experience with my Lenovo, hope it’s fine for you",
  "i bought the maxxed out config and i am quite happy with it. the display is gorgeous",
  "In general avoid 2 in 1 laptops, almost always badly built and there isn’t really a good option. And Yogas are usually very thin and break easily on their own. Steer clear of those. \n\nAlso glass screens are usually fine unless whole screen is glass. Stuff where the glass screen is encased in a plastic/metal frame is much better, plastic screens are not ideal.",
  "Thank you for your input. I've seen a loooooot of mixed reviews about the yogas, and as a recent member of the \"I hate ideapads\" community, I've been a bit skeptical of anything that isn't a Thinkpad when it comes to Lenovo... Unfortunately, I'm limited to BestBuy and ThinkPads are out of my price range, otherwise I'd just get one of those and deal with the mouse drawing. I'm glad to hear that you've had a good overall experience with the brand though; I'll definitely keep this in mind when I finally make a decision.",

  "yes smooth action can initially open with one finger then use 2 to open fully",

Wish prices weren't so crazy here too. Feels like I'm spinning in circles just to find something I can afford that I'll be happy with.\n\nI've definitely heard better about the ideaPad pro build quality, so your statement makes sense. The ideapad that I had, and returned, wasn't a pro, and the casing was plastic and felt very cheap tbh. Perhaps I'll just steer clear of anything with a plastic case and see where that gets me.",

  "I'm kinda on a tight budget so I'm probably a bit biased when it comes to my definition of \"crazy prices,\" but from what I've seen, it does appear that tech prices in general have jumped if they are imported in some way. Don't completely take my word on that tho, that was only like 30min of reading stuff online. Not surprising if it's true, it's a dumpster fire over here right now.\n\nNo easy access to huawei that I know of, over here; looks like ebay would be the best option for getting one. I've never heard of them before your comment, so definitely not common over here as far as I'm aware.\n\nThanks for the other suggestions and commentary about them.

I’ve looked into several options, and the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 seems like the best choice in that price range. I’m interested in hearing about other people’s experiences with this laptop: how is the battery life, is it fast enough? The screen has an IPS panel, so I don’t think it's too bad in that regard. I need the laptop mainly for studying and everyday tasks, and it's important to me that it lasts for 4–5 years. Do you think this laptop is good enough, or should I consider some slightly better and more expensive options? Thanks in advance!",
  "I wouldn't buy this laptop as it's 2 major generations old. Look for something newer.\n\nCheck what the specifications of the IPS is. If it's 45% ntsc, then it's trash. The colors can be insanely dull.",

Getting 4-5 years out of any laptop is pretty hard without REALLY taking care of it.",

  "The Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 feels basic and underwhelming. Its plastic build rattles, and the fan noise is annoying even on battery. The screen is okay but nothing special, and the outdated Intel processor struggles with multitasking and gaming. Slow Wi-Fi and limited ports only add to the frustration. For the price, it feels like too many compromises were made, making it a tough recommendation. If you want a budget laptop, there are better options out there that don’t feel this sluggish or cheap. Definitely not a laptop I’d want to rely on daily.",
  "Yes, the screen is 45% NTSC, but I don’t pay too much attention to that because of my limited budget. What matters more to me is that it has good memory and a good processor. The other laptops I’ve looked at in this price range have TN screens, which are much worse.",

The thing is, this CPU only has 8 cores/8 threads, and from what I'm seeing on benchmarking sites like NanoReview, the single-core performance is solid but the multicore scores are pretty underwhelming.\n\nMy main use cases are:\n\n* Office work (Microsoft Office suite)\n* AI applications and Coding\n* Cloud Computing\n* Cloud gaming via GeForce NOW\n\nI'm not doing heavy video editing or anything like that. Given what I'll be using it for, should I be concerned about the multicore performance?

  "Okay I'm a CS grad as well, with industry and research experience so let me give you my opinion on this. \n\nThe nix shell or the posix shell is better yes and you'll be better suited with it, but considering budget and pragmatism,  you can also use windows subsystem for linux or wsl. So right now, the main deciding factor for you should be which os you're more comfortable with? Hardware specs are one thing but if you have to sacrifice years of workflow and familiarity it's not worth switching. So if you're on Windows now, stay on Windows. If you've been on macOS, stay on macOS. \n\nAnd obviously cost is a no brainer. If you want more bang for the buck and the Windows machine does your job, why not? \n\nP.S. - 32 GB should make it a breeze to run WSL as the underlying VM takes up about 4GB and you can shut it down when you don't need it.
