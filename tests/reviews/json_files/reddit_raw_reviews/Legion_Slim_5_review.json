  "Which Laptop Should I Pick? Lenovo Legion Slim 5 OR HP Zbook Firefly G11 I'm a mechanical engineering student looking for a 14inch laptop for college for around 1000$. my two picks right now are either the HP Zbook Firefly g11 or the Lenovo Legion Slim 5. The legion is a refurbished laptop off of lenovo outlet.\n\nI'm concerned about the firefly because there are very mixed reviews, and some say it has good battery life and performance, others dont. I'd be getting the version with the intel ultra 5-135H and dedicated nvidia A500 GPU. I want this to be enough to do some light gaming and use CAD and simulation software for engineering. I like this laptop because it is very slim and professional. I just hope the battery life is good. \n\nOn the other hand, I love everything about the legion's performance and battery life (it has an AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS Processor and a nvidia 4060), but i am only slightly concerned about it being refurbished, and I also don't want it to stick out as a \"gaming\" laptop. It seems pretty slim but I cant tell how it will look in person. Any suggestions?",
  "The Legion Slim 5, hands down. I actually bought a refurbished one from this eBay seller: https://ebay.us/Jpwgit and it’s been good, no issues so far. The performance is amazing for the price, especially for CAD and light gaming. It doesn’t look too gamer-y either, just a bit thicker than ultrabooks but still clean-looking. #ad",
  "I also looked at the ACER Swift x 14, but i dont like that it has horrible fan noise",
  "Big difference in graphic card performance in favor of the legion slim. H series draw more power than HS processors so battery life will be affected. Look up the TDP of both processors to check. Gaming laptop stigma isnt really a thing in undergrad unless it is loud/has obnoxious lighting. People will respect it if you are an engineering student with a gaming laptop vs a history major with a gaming laptop. Rgb could make you popular at parties in the dark though.",
  "Manufacturer wise, Lenovo is hands down better than HP",
  "TDP stands for **thermal design power**, and for the Zbook it is only 57W",
  "Should I go to Asus Tuf or Rog strix or legion slim? Tuf is 1399$, Rog 1599$, legion 1729$\n\nI would like to know the usage difference, I'm going to use this for gaming(how will it be the quality with high graphics games?), photoshop and 3D softwares.",
  "ROG",
  "rog you will hae to upgrade the ssd later on though",
  "Can I ask for what reason you think rog is the better choice?",
  "Yes, I will probably do it. Can I ask why you think Rog is a better choice?",
  "4070",
  "better gpu and correct me but i think its a better cpu",
  "ASUS TUF A15, Lenovo LOQ 15 or Lenovo Legion Slim 5 with slightly lower specs? I’m an architecture student, I want a budget-friendly gaming laptop that is strong for renders and 3D softwares, also I don’t own a PS5 or a next-gen gaming console, which might be the case for a long while, so I want a laptop that also performs well in games. I currently have 3 options that I cannot decide between:\n\n1-ASUS TUF A15 Ryzen 7 7735hs RTX 4060 8gb VRAM 1080p 144hz\n\n2-Lenovo LOQ 15 intel i7 13620h RTX 4060 8gb 1080p 144hz\n\n3-Lenovo Legion Slim 5 intel i7 13700h RTX 4050 6gb VRAM 2K display 165hz\n\nThe ASUS is the cheapest, with both the LOQ and the Legion being equally priced. I went to a store and asked one of the workers there about the ASUS and told me so many good stuff about it compared to the LOQ, such as the cooling system and build quality, but watching reviews on this model of ASUS, all comments on it are kinda mixed which makes me scared of getting it, I’m more convinced about getting the LOQ because I heard it has a better display which is something that strongly matters to me. \n\nAs for the Legion, I heard that it’s the BEST budget gaming laptop there is, though considering that it’s gpu is 4050 instead of 4060, it makes me scared of regretting my purchase, since 4060 is significantly better than the 4050.\n\nSorry for all of this text, but I would love some advice, if it is based on personal experience that would be a lot better, but all suggestions are welcome, thanks! :))\n\n",
  "I'd do the LOQ or the Legion in your scenario. I know they're promising to be better but the ASUS support stories still scare the shit out of me. I really wouldn't trust in-store workers on anything, they're just trying to sell you stuff. \n\nMeanwhile I've used Lenovo support multiple times for repairs and full part replacements without problems. The 4060 will be way, way better than the 4050, so the LOQ is the best bang for your buck. I have an LOQ with a 7840HS and a mobile 4060 and it's basically my workstation now as well - it plays all games at high/ultra and doesn't have any problems. Had this for almost a year now with no problems.",
  "Thank you for the suggestion! I’ve been thinking about getting the LOQ too, but I haven’t heard great stuff about the thermals and the build quality. Does the build quality feel cheap? Or is it durable enough? And is the cooling good when playing games?",
  "Legion Slim 5 or Dell G15 Hello, I'm about to purchase one of these 2 laptops but I'm having a hard time deciding. Here are the specs of both:  \n\n\nLegion Slim 5: R5 7640HS, RTX 4060, 16GB DDR5, 512GB SSD for $900  \nDell G15: R7 7840HS,RTX 4060, 16GB DDR5, 512GB SSD for $950  \n\n\nBasically the difference is the processor. I'm aware that the Dell is bulky and has a heavy charger, but that is not a problem for me because I will use the laptop as a desktop, will be plugged 99% of the time. However, I've seen reviews mention that it has one of the best cooling systems in this price range, plus a better processor. I know the Legion has a better display, but it's not important for me either as I will connect 2 external 1080p monitors which are the main ones I use. My main use will be software development and gaming.   \n\n\nSo, excluding the weight and the display, which one would you recommend and why? ",
  "the first option because even tho the processor is alittle better the legion does have better cooling and the legion series outperforms when it comes to gaming laptops",
  "Is this laptop worth 1049.99? ",
  "I would presume so",
  "100%",
  "Yes, very reputable brand too (don't worry about the number of reviews)",
  "Yeah.  \nKnown brand with good hinges, damn beautiful, great components too.  \nIt's OLED too.  \nI'd buy it for sure.  \n\nOP, I think you're either wasting our time or wasting your money, to say so as nicely as possible.  \nThis laptop is everything you need and want at 1k$.  \nYou want RGB? FINE! Get some laptop with worse specs that's marketed \"for gaming\" and see it suck in games.  \nThis one is good for years if you do proper maintenance.(Just like any other laptop).",
  "Yes",
  "i recently bought the legion pro 5i, all those specs except less storage, no oled and it’s 16in. it has 4 zone rgb. It’s an incredible laptop. imo the legion line has the best laptops for its price, honestly i would pay more for it. i’m LOVING it, the gaming performance is impressive. i also thought it looked boring when i saw it online but in person it looks great. My screen isn’t OLED like the version you posted and i still think it’s fantastic. LOVE that most ports are at the back and not the side. just a well designed and powerful laptop, i would highly recommend.",
  "Sorry guys, its 1049.99 US dollars",
  "If it’s usd, seems like a good deal",
  "Yeah that's pretty good.",
  "It's decent, do some looking around to compare price to other websites",
  "Probably would need to upgrade the RAM tho",
  "No",
  "my laptop had a 3060, same cpu and bettet screen and cost 500 more",
  "Specs like this are worth double that in most places of the world so if you question is is it worth buying, then the answer is yes",
  "Looks a decent laptop at that price. Go ahead and buy it if you like it. Number of reviews don't really mean anything. If you're still on the fence, just look it up on YouTube",
  "Do you guys know when is the best time for a laptop discount? Are there specific day for discount?",
  "yolo",
  "Decent",
  "My friend just bought this, definitely worth the money + the screen is beautiful",
  "1049.99 of what currency?",
  "Kinda meh, you can get basically the same thing for 800 usually if you look for a good deal",
  "I have a 17” legion with a 3060. Things been great to me for the last few years!",
  "The screen and the specs look good. I would try the touchpad and decide. \n\nCheap plastic touchpads are a NO GO on expensive laptops. Or the other way around: I don’t understand why the majority Windows machines continue to try to copy Apple with cheap plastic touchpads and still put outrageous price tags.",
  "I have that laptop, it's worth it and i bought it for $1250",
  " Go for it !! Or zephyrus g14 is also the option !! It has offers going on time to time on bestbuy",
  "yeah its good for the price",
  "My dad got a laptop with worst specs for 1500 :(",
  "Here is your stupid question of the day: If a laptop is excellent at gaming can I assume it is excellent at non gaming, just business stuff? Or is a gaming laptop just built for gaming and actually doesn't handle Excel and Teams very well?",
  "Its ok",
  "Going off of what I know with the legion brand, I would only say it depends if it's a metal casing or plastic casing.\n\nPlastic casing from my experience just feels cheaper and easier to break. The metal will give a premium feel.",
  "This is in all possibility, really really good. I remember paying similar amount for i7 8th gen 8GB RAM, 128 GB SSD, 1 TB HDD, 4GB 1080 Ti. This was in 2019 though.",
  "yes ofc",
  "hell yeah. I bought a laptop with an i7-10750H and 3060 6gb in 2021 for like 1800$. I'd be more than happy to upgrade to that(ofc I won't cuz I don't have 1050$)",
  "Good deal!!",
  "It is but I’d still always recommend buying with a warranty. And having it shipped to a local store before picking it up. Like ordering from Best Buy then having them do the set up. (They will catch any problems before you bring it home).",
  "100%",
  "Godlike CPU\n\nMeh GPU\n\nEntry level RAM capacity\n\n🤡 🤡 🤡 🤡 🤡",
  "Lots of people answering that it's worth it but none of them have a clue which CURRENCY you use in your country... this might be Roubles or Yen or Hong Kong Dollars for all we know.",

  "Do you have any other laptop suggestions? This one only have 100ish people reviews, i am kind scared",
  "Do you have any other laptop suggestions? This one only have 100ish people reviews, i am kind scared",
  "second this",
  "This one doesnt look that cool, no rgb light and that kinda stuff, do you know any laptop thats cool , same quality (a bit more expensive is acceptable)",
  "Thank you and sorry man, i got scammed multiple times, spending lots of money to get something really bad, i dont want to experience this again, mb",
  "Do you have any other laptop suggestions? This one only have 100ish people reviews, i am kind scared",
  "Can you send the link",
  "Sorry, but what is usd",
  "It’s not when it was 799 before",
  "Do you know any fancy one? This one have no rgb and cool stuff",
  "Sadly, the RAM is soldered in. But you can buy a 32GB ram model from Lenovo's website directly. Unfortunately, its $1620 right now for 32GB ram + 1TB SSD.  I don't how often Lenovo does sales but I managed to nab the 32GB RAM 1TB model for under $1300",
  "You can't, it's soldered to the board.\n\nOnly problem with these slim laptops.",
  "16GB is good enough",
  "Can i ask why",
  "Can you send me a link to the laptop",
  "[deleted]",
  "Alr bro, everyone is saying this laptop worth it, im getting it:))",
  "Thank you bro, everyone is saying its pretty good, im getting it:)",
  "USD",
  "No you can't.. Not with an oled and a 4060. This screen is downright beautiful and worth a little extra.",
  "Gaming laptop means good specs that can handle everything, it can handle both business and gaming",
  "[removed]",
  "Us dollars",
  "Dollars",
  "wtf",
  "Bro what? 😂 Idk if there are any mainstream laptop rtx 3050 mods that doubles its vram. I’m sure Lenovo doesn’t do it.",
  "100 reviews is more than enough for a laptop",
  "It only recently began being sold, so it's normal that there aren't 1000+ reviews on the product.  Lenovo make some of the best gaming laptops, I'm sure this one would perform just fine.",
  "I think it should be great",
  "It's a Lenovo, you're good.  Just don't get a HP or MSI.",
  "For gaming zephyrus g14",
  "you can get the zephyrus g14 but i would honestly opt for this one, lenovo legion has a good reputation. The price is okay too",
  "You have wrong prorities my friend, rgb isn't important, it's the parts inside that are, like what cpu, GPU and ram and stuff, but it's your money so you do you.",
  "Check out dave2d youtube channel, most of his reviews are gaming laptops of all price ranges. You are best off shopping for slightly older models on big discounts from retailers like bestbuy, they always have good devices on sale",
  "I meaannnn literally anything other than razer blade has shitty rgb no?",
  "There is Asus tuf series but lenevo has better build quality and temps so just go with the lenevo",
  "I understand, but if you want RGB you'll likely get scammed. You'll get scammed by thinking it's still worth the price, when this one is worth 1k$, it's the definition of a 1k$ laptop if you ask me.  \nBest damn thing at this price.  \nNow, with this specs, I must ask, are you looking for a gaming LAPTOP, or a PC?  \nThe laptop is underpowered compared to the PC because of the thermals and battery, but the PC lacks much of the portability.  \nGet a laptop if you need it to be portable, not if it's like the 5th criteria on your list.",
  "I own this laptop . Overall, it's great that even Youtuber Jared's Tech also named it the best 14-inch gaming laptop of 2023 . The display is beautiful, the performance is great, and the downside is soldered ram and mediocre speakers\n\nThe other option i considered was the G14 2023 with 4060 and the G16 2023 4060 they were around 1100 ish after taxes",
  "as the guy said the one you posted is better than mine! once you don’t mind a smaller screen and no rgb like mine, get it.",
  "Get the one you posted it's way better.",
  "US Dollars",
  "Wait a minute, it was 799 before?",
  "I've never seen this one 799. I think you're talking about a different model.",
  "its ur money so its ur choice 100% but if youre going for a laptop I think rgb should be last of ur worries.",
  "You'd probably have to either pay more or start compromising on actual specs.",
  "Ah right, I forgot that this is the slim version. My bad.",
  "the 16” version is not soldered",
  "For a short while, yes. Not in the long run though.",
  "not sure if its on sale anymore. ill check anyway and find out",
  "ROG STRIX SCAR G15 Electro Punk",
  "wow! thanks for pointing that out! i really didnt know! 🤩🤩",
  "Also you'll love the oled screen",
  "I've seen OLED g14 go to 800, as well as gigabyte aero OLED go to like 900. Both with 4060",
  "Are you saying that business applications will use more battery than gaming ?",
  "WHICH COUNTRY?! Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, USA, and numerous other countries use Dollars, ALL with different values...",
  "Why is that, made me curious",
  "I have a laptop with a 3050ti with 12 gigs of vram",
  "You convinced me, and do you think this is worth it? I play lots of games though, including 3A.",
  "Also, do you guys know if theres like a day for laptop discount or something like that, ehen is the best time to buy laptop",
  "This one only have less than 200 reviews, im kind concerning",
  "Some Lenovo has nice red lighting with a custom bios that makes rgb available on all keys.",
  "[removed]",
  "US dollars, my bad",
  "Most people will assume US dollars when you say dollars especially since a majority of redditors are based in the US.  No need to be so aggressive damn",
  "I have no idea what that person is talking about. Also yes the Slim 14inch is a steal at that price.",
  "It is a good purchase. Buy it.",
  "3050 is not even comparable to a 4060.. he's just saying nonsense.",
  "a 3050 is not good compared to a 4060",
  "Honestly, I think it could handle everything, maybe not at MAX settings, but at good ones and also reviews don't always mean anything, just because something doesn't have a ton of reviews doesn't mean it sucks,just means not that many like to write reviews or that many people haven't found this laptop yet and people also buy such laptops on other sites as well.",
  "considering laptops often get like 20 reviews, its fine",
  "Gotcha.",
  "OK thank you. Have a good day.",
  "User-Review: Ninkear A15 Pro The Ninkear A15 Pro has been updated with more current hardware this year. Its predecessor was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H. The 2025 model uses an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U. Read my review here to find out how the device performs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyf9pncxu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd25bbdde81ba27af2fd5169b47bd3c9aa17f05\n\n**Design and workmanship**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro retains a straightforward and unobtrusive design. The housing is made of aluminum alloy, which contributes to a solid feel. The surface is matte and resistant to fingerprints. The workmanship is appropriate for this price category, with clean edges and fits. The hinge still allows the display to be opened up to 180 degrees, which makes it more flexible to use and gives it stability. Weighing often less than 1.8 kg and with a slim design that is 20 mm thick, it is also easy to transport.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5aceszu9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e8e1ef90e4b8338a011ab2802ff609941dbe25\n\nThe base is made entirely of aluminum and can be easily removed after removing 11 Phillips screws.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti7foey1v9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4025e49254415ed35592f152584bd31cda7ac101\n\n**Display**\n\nOne feature of the Ninkear A15 Pro is its 16-inch IPS display. It offers QHD resolution (2560 x 1600 pixels), which enables sharp display of text and images. The brightness is specified at 400 nits. The color space coverage in the sRGB range is 99-100%, making the display suitable for multimedia content, light image editing, and office applications. The 120 Hz refresh rate supports smooth display.\n\n**Performance**\n\nInside the 2025 Ninkear A15 Pro is an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U with a TDP of 15W. These CPUs offer balanced performance and energy efficiency. In conjunction with 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (one module) and a 1 TB NVMe SSD connected via PCIe 3.0. Daily tasks, multitasking, demanding office applications, and basic image or video editing can be performed smoothly. The integrated AMD Radeon also allows you to play less demanding games at moderate settings. Fortnite runs in Full HD at around 60FPS on the lowest settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivvbzf5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b5fc6852f21829cc49bbf8164cc7fcd4732269\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dg3ne1g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fabe070c429c1b00cb2d3a64cced24cedbf1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbno40g5v9ef1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=569979cb24136170fa055d0d9d9b90cd404af375\n\n  \nThe built-in PCIe 3.0 SSD is from a manufacturer called TSWC, which I am not familiar with, and I can't find any information about it on Google. The temperatures remained constant at 44°C.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye3nhzr7v9ef1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5999ee43785995c0cbd9fa02de490d00be345bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjv4vxr7v9ef1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d062da74b8645bc1cb25153738289b9630cab\n\nThe performance in Crystaldiskmark is also acceptable. However, the SSD was only 19% full. With an almost full SSD, the situation can be quite different. With inexpensive SSDs, transfer rates can plummet.\n\nSince I don't have another PC or laptop with a 6-core (and 12-thread) CPU, there is no comparable model here. The closest thing I have is an AMD Ryzen 5800H in my Lenovo Legion, but it has 2 more cores and is therefore always faster.\n\n\n\n|Benchmarks|Ninkear A15 Pro|\n|:-|:-|\n|3D mark Timespy (complete/CPU)|826/4390|\n|Cinebench 2024 (single/multi)|55/348|\n|Fortnite 1920x1080 Performance Mode all low|58FPS|\n\n**Input devices and connectivity, scope of delivery**\n\nThe keyboard of the Ninkear A15 Pro is backlit and offers a pleasant typing experience with good key travel and a clear pressure point. The keyboard itself has an ANSI-US layout, and no other layout is available for purchase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4wb1oynv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8d3e7ca926567506df4725b2c054188998060b\n\nThe touchpad is a comfortable size, responds precisely, and supports Windows multitouch gestures without any problems. The fingerprint sensor is located in the upper left corner of the touchpad and works flawlessly with Windows Hello.\n\nUnlike the Ninkear N15 Pro, which I also tested, the two touchpad buttons are quiet and do not make a loud clicking sound when pressed.\n\nConnectivity is comprehensive: the device has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1) with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, plus three USB-A ports (USB 3.0), an HDMI output for external monitors, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a micro SD card slot. For wireless connections, there is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. On my 5GHz Wi-Fi, the laptop connects at 866 Mbit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6vvneqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316d28c48d3bb1dd8dda8447db11fc5bdf8f2f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqx8geqv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f0a5d9d59398a2e469fb0ece00bcc616028516\n\nIn addition to the Ninkear A15 Pro, the package includes a 65W USB-C power adapter, a very simple, inexpensive wired mouse, a small mouse pad, and stickers for the keyboard to customize it to your preferred language.\n\n**Battery life and cooling**\n\nThe battery life of the Ninkear A15 Pro is adequate thanks to the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen processors. With moderate use (office, browsing, streaming), 6 to 7 hours of use are possible, making it a companion for the workday or longer university sessions. The cooling system is barely audible during normal operation. Even under load, the noise level remains low, and the case only heats up in certain areas, but remains very inconspicuous overall.\n\n**Upgrading**\n\nThe RAM can be upgraded as there is one slot free. The built-in RAM is from a manufacturer unknown to me called Gofatoo. It will be very difficult to find a second identical RAM module. If you plan to upgrade the RAM, buy two 16GB modules from one manufacturer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f0wg3ktv9ef1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b2596f11b270335be8260aea8e08d583b44df4\n\nThere is also a second NVME SSD slot in which a second SSD can be installed. This is also connected with PCIe 3.0 x4.\n\nThe Wi-Fi module is also located in an M.2 slot and can be replaced if necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ninkear A15 Pro (2025 version) offers a good balance between price and performance and is aimed at those who are looking for a notebook for productivity, multimedia, and occasional gaming. For students, home office users, and anyone who needs a reliable all-rounder, the Ninkear A15 Pro (2025) is a good option. The price in the company's own online shop is currently around €570. The device is shipped from Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about support and/or warranty issues.\n\nThanks to Ninkear for providing me with the device for testing.\n\n\n\nBest regards, hugoLOST",

  "Which is better option, slim $900 Gaming Laptop + $150 Cooling Pad or a $1200 Bulky gaming laptop ? I’m kinda stuck deciding between the two. I bring my laptop to the office, and as someone who commutes regularly, carrying a bulky gaming laptop is such a pain. But on the other hand, I mostly play games at my apartment, mainly Paradox titles, so I don’t really need a super powerful GPU anyway\n\nRight now, I’m considering slim gaming laptops like the ASUS K16/V16 or Acer Nitro Lite, which cost around $800–$900. However, many reviews mention overheating issues, so I’d probably need to buy a cooling pad like one from Llano or something similar, adding about $150\n\nThe other option is going for something bulkier like the Legion 5, around $1,200. It’s heavier, but not that bad\n\nWhich option would be better overall?

My budget is only $500, absolutely no higher.\nI don’t need to be able to game on it, I already have a gaming PC and Lenovo Legion Go lol\n\nHowever, I’m a Mechanical Engineering major so I’ll need to be able to run some heavier software like CAD, MATLAB, other simulation tools, etc.\n\nPortability is also a factor because I’ll be taking it back and forth to work with me every day to do coursework in my downtime.\n\nThe only options I can find near me are the ASUS Vivobook with Intel Core 5 120U and the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U. \nBased on reviews online, and especially on a Reddit, I’m scared to pull the trigger on either one now.\n\nIs there a better option that I haven’t found yet?",

  "Hard time choosing a new laptop. So I currently am using a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, and am planning on upgrading because: A) It is not powerful enough, and B) Windows is far superior to MacOS.\n\nI am a student and will primarily be using the laptop for school work, so it needs to be portable and a comfortable weight to bring with me to and from class. I love how portable my 13\" Air is. I've done a LOT of research over the past two years, but never bit the bullet, but I feel like now is the time, and so I've committed to buying one now.\n\nMy use cases (in order of importance): School, Music Production, Photoshop, Gaming\n\nI don't play a lot of games but it would be nice to have a machine to play some Civ 6 or even some other, more intensive games like BO2/BO3 Zombies (and MAYBEEEE some RDR2) when I am on a plane for a long time. I want something that's decent on battery life, I don't spend all day at school, maybe 4 hours at most on a given day, so I want something that'll last me that long doing just school work without having to even worry about bringing a charger.\n\nNow, I've looked at like tens of laptops, from gaming to notebook, and I've seen some I've considered like the Zenbook S16, Lenovo Slim 7i Aura, Zenbook 14, Zenbook A14, but I've narrowed it down to a couple:\n\nZephyrus G14/G16 - The clear winner for me, problem is it is just too expensive, and the only models that go on sale into my price range are the 4050 G14 and 4060 G16 models which I've heard may not be worth it. They don't go on sale super often, and the ones that do are open box. (Currently can get the 4050 model for $1499 CAD open box)\n\nZenbook Duo 2024 (Ultra 9, 32GB, 1TB, 60hz 1080p model) - I've toyed with the idea of having this laptop for a while. My PC setup at home has 3 monitors and I absolutely love it, and could see myself getting genuine use out of both screens when writing an assignment, key word being WHEN I am doing an assignment, which isn't an every day thing. I don't think it would be powerful enough to handle any gaming at all. Surprisingly, this is actually cheaper than both the G14 and G16 Models I would be getting. (Currently can get it Refurb-Excellent for $1519 CAD)\n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 15\" - This just came out, and I feel like 15\" is the perfect size for me to be honest. I can get the spec with the Ryzen 7 260, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD (will add another in the future), and a 5060 8GB card for within my price range, around $1750 all in. It's around 4 pounds which is the heaviest of the three, but is also the fastest of the three. It's so new that there isn't a single review yet for it. (Brand new for $1750 CAD, could try and haggle it at Lenovo)\n\nThese are my three ideas right now in terms of what to get. Does anyone have any recommendations? Anyone with these laptops have advice?\n\nI'd not like to spend more than $2000 CAD.\n\nEDIT: In case it wasn't clear, this is not meant to be a desktop replacement; I already have one.",
  "Well you need to be aware of the fact that most gaming laptops have a dedicated gpu they are loud heavy and the battery life is 3hours at best and the performance is ass when on battery .\nSo you’ll want something with a powerful igpu like a Ryzen ai 300 series (the Ryzen 7 or 9 models) or the intel core ultra 200 series ( like the ultra 7 258v) these have the most powerful iGPUs currently available. Also their batter life is pretty good.",
  "Don't buy the Zenbook duo. It's more of a gimmick and not a good choice for your use case. \n\nGaming laptops all suffer from battery life. They always need to be plugged in. They don't last long. \n\nYou might want to get something with a modern AMD Ryzen 8000 series CPU. The integrated graphics are good for some light gaming. These CPU are also power efficient so you get good battery life.\n\nAsus Zenbook S16 and Zenbook 14 should be the models to consider. The models with AMD Ryzen CPUs.",

  "1700€ or 900€ laptop?? OBJECTIVES:\nI need a laptop for working in the summer and at the library, so I don’t have to carry my desktop and monitor. Remote work isn’t an option due to poor WiFi in cafes and libraries.\n\nPrograms I use: Houdini, Unreal Engine, After Effects, Premiere Pro, Blender\n\nLaptops Considered:\n\t•\tMSI Katana ❌ Poor reviews, cheap plastic build\n\t•\tHP Omen ❌ Selling old stock with black screen issues (might be fixed in 2025)\n\n\t•\tLenovo Legion Slim 5 (RTX 4060, 32GB) Good materials, solid cooling, positive reviews. The Slim version may not be ideal, but a classmate using it for Houdini says it performs well. \n\n\t•\tLenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 8 (RTX 4070, Ryzen 9, 32GB) €1699. Good performance, but Lenovo laptops reportedly overheat and die after ~5 years.\n\t•\tGigabyte Aorus 16X 9SG ❓ Great cooling system, but I don’t know much else.\n\n\nMY THOUGHTS: \nI need a powerful laptop but not top-tier—spending over 1000€ doesn’t make sense since it won’t match my desktop anyway. \n\nInitially, I considered the Lenovo Legion Pro 5 (RTX 4070, Ryzen 9, 32GB, 1TB) for Houdini and Unreal, but realistically, I only need it for Unreal (mid-high workloads) and video editing. Houdini caching/rendering isn’t worth doing on a laptop—it’s better handled by my desktop, and 13h+ caching would destroy battery life.\n\nSo, for just Unreal and video editing, is a €1700€ laptop really worth it, or would a cheaper one with an older RTX and maybe 64GB RAM (+€200) be a smarter choice? I got the money but I feel like spending 900€ more for this purpose would be more worth it to spend in improving my other pc specs. ",

  "Is this laptop good for video editing? Hello reddit, my girlfriend is looking for a good laptop to use for video editting. I have been looking around but dont know much about computers. Shes asked for my help and this is what I came up with. What do you guys think? Also a link to the website where I found it (dutch): https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1963276/lenovo-legion-slim-5-16aph8-82y9008nmh/specificaties/",
  "It depends what kind of video editing, 4K, 6K, 8K, which app you're using (Adobe cloud, Davinci Resolve), how many layers, effects, etc. It should be good enough to edit 4k even 6k footage. From what I can see, this one has Ryzen 7 7840HS which should be enough for Adobe Cloud apps as they are more CPU oriented, as well as rtx 4070 which should help with Davinci Resolve for example, as it is more GPU oriented. For video editing you also want to check color display which should be at least 100% srgb or even better, 100% Adobe srgb or  100% DCI-P3 color gamut. I can't seem to find that for this one from the information you've provided.\n\nGenerally speaking you want to look for Ryzen 7 or 9 from 7 series (you'll see some numbers like \"Ryzen 7 **7**840HS\" or \"Ryzen 9  **7**900HX\". When first number is 7 it means it's from that series). Also from Intel i7 or i9 from 13 series (you'll see some numbers like \"i7 **13**650h\" or \"i9 **13**900\" so when the first number is 13, it means it's from that latest series). For GPU go for rtx4060 (4070 is great btw) or higher. And look for screen colors like i mentioned before. Also, the more RAM, the better. 16 is good, but more is always better (the one you mentioned has expandable memory up to 32GB which is good as you can always add a bit more).\n\np.s. I'm no computer expert but I'm also on the lookout for a video editing laptop and after extensive research, I've opted for Vivobook 15 PRO oled with either i9 13900h CPU or with new Ultra 9 185h CPU, rtx 4060. It has OLED display with  100% DCI-P3 color gamut. And expandable RAM memory as well as thunderbolt 4. Both are at around 1500 euros, so if you want to spend a bit more, those ones I would recommend.\n\nAlso, I've watched this guy's videos  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf6MBfIiTUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf6MBfIiTUs)",

  "White Screen Flashes when surfing web or watching Netflix I got a new laptop with Black Friday (Lenovo Legion Slim 5 16APH8 82Y9008NMH).  When browsing the web or especially when opening a youtube video, the full screen turns white for a fraction of a second. Sometimes it holds the white screen for a few seconds. The flashes often go paired with a peak in GPU usage on my integrated graphics card, and \"Wifi\"  according to Task Manager.\n\nI sent it back to exchange it for a new one since it was within warranty period... Same exact thing happens with the second one. I sent that one back as well and again, the third computer is showing it too.\n\nI have really tried to look everywhere for what the cause could be. All drivers are up to date (first one had both GPUs disabled so I figured it was that at first, but the two others have the same issues and look fine as well). I set up all computers as a new PC. The third one I didn't even put in a mouse to check if it was that, but no. Hardware issues seem unlikely due to it being a problem on all three of them (and yet other buyers are giving positive reviews, so it is unlikely they face the same issue.\n\nI use Fusion360 as well (3D modeling software) and that doesn't show any white screens at all throughout a full day. I have the issue with different wifi networks. I use Google Chrome, and have yet to test it with other browsers.\n\nThe other weird thing is that the numlock on all three of them is switched up: the indicator light is *on* when it is turned *off,* and vice versa. No clue if this has something to do with it, but wanted to include it in the post, maybe it helps. There don't appear to be other problems with the machine.\n\nAny ideas or advice would be appreciated! Thanks in advance",

With Black Friday coming up, I'm planning to buy a laptop with good performance, decent dedicated GPU, 16GB or more RAM (prefer 32GB so that I won't have to upgrade in the near future), and at least 512 GB SSD.\n\nI'm an engineering student + part freelancer and content creator, so the rig will be used for things like: CAD, simulation software, VMs, Video Editing, video conferencing, and recording videos for YT.

  "Vostro 7510 Review/ Advice Request  \n\nI really appreciated this (and other) reddit when I was searching for a laptop, and wanted to return the favor with a quick review of this laptop. I am not a formal laptop reviewer, and don’t have fancy gizmos to check nits or color accuracy, but wanted to share. I have only been using it for about a day or two, and I may or may not post some updates as I use this more. There’s also some chance that I will return it. \n\nModel: [https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-vostro-7510-laptop/spd/vostro-15-7510-laptop/smv157w10p1c4005?view=configurations)\n\n(purchased on sale for $1150 + 10% CB).\n\nI wouldn’t mind some advice from the sub on whether to keep this or return for one of two slightly more gamery computers that will seemingly solve some of the issues I have with this - either the Lenovo Legion 7 Slim or the HP Omen 16.1 AMD (if it gets released on HP’s site soon enough). \n\n**Background:**\n\nI joined a small business and needed a laptop. I purchased my last laptop \\~11 years ago and while it aged gracefully… that's like 85 in laptop years. Business required that the laptop have Windows 10 Pro, and preferred that it have biometric security. I wanted it to be thin, and have good build quality so it will hold up well. I also wanted to be able to play the new AOE when it comes out (i.e., light RTS and 4x type games). Finally, I needed the laptop yesterday so I didn’t have time to wait around for the best deal.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\nI think this laptop falls short in a few ways: (1) it spontaneously shut down the first day I was using it. Enough battery, updated Microsoft drivers, and no indication of why when I turned it back on. Not sure what it was, but I updated the Dell drivers and it hasn't happened again in the few hours of use since that. (2) Battery life could be better, once I was down to less than 40% after about 3 hours of (non-gaming) use (downloading and installing some applications, light browsing). As I type this I have 2:56 estimated remaining at 77% of the battery on “better battery” setting. The battery estimate was also all over the place. I don’t think it’s fair to expect much more out of a 56 whr battery, but I think it is fair to expect more than a 56 whr battery in this kind of laptop. (3) The keyboard is ok - typing feels nice enough, although I liked my old Lenovo’s keyboard a little bit better. The backlighting is a joke. (4) Cooling. I ran Offworld Trading Company, which was free from Epic Games at the time I received this computer, and after less than 15 minutes of play I found the palm rest to be warm, and (using a food thermometer) found the temperature to be over 100 fahrenheit on the speakers, and about 127 fahrenheit right underneath the vents. The fans were noticeably loud as well. Task manager says the GPU got up to 65c. That seemed pretty warm for a few minutes of play on a 5 year old game.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\nThe strengths are in the specs: i7 with a 3050ti, aluminum chassis (there is a very thin plastic bezel around the screen, but it's small enough to get over. Pretty good build quality. Touchpad is spacious. It’s relatively heavy for a 2021 laptop, but it has a dGPU and is pretty thin. Screen is pretty nice and color accurate, although I suspect nothing special in 2021. And I will be able to play aoe4 on this (when it comes out). \n\n**Dell Customer Service:**\n\nI also wanted to call out a good experience with Dell Customer Service. Without getting into the details, they made things right quickly and followed up to make sure things ended up ok. \n\n**Request for Advice:**\n\nWhen I was looking at this I was also between the Lenovo Legion 7 slim which is a few hundred dollars more, but has a higher refresh screen and the 3060. I decided that because I am looking to play RTS/4x games that are typically not AAA graphically intensive, a 3050 would be enough and I would be better saving the money. \n\nI was also considering the new HP Omen AMD 16.1, but it still hasn't been released on HP’s website (where they have frequent 10% off gaming PC sales), and given that I need something now, I may not be able to wait until they can ship it.\n\nNow that I have used the Vostro, and have pointed out the above concerns, do you think I’ll get (a) significantly better battery life on one of those other options, and (b) is the cooling significant enough to cause problems with my use of the Dell?",
  "Just 1 question. Does it have 1 or 2 SO-DIMM memory slots??\n\nOne review said 8GB is soldered. One Dell maintenance manual shows 2.\n\nI'm between this and the 15\" LG Ultra with the GTX 1650 Ti. The Dell has the true full size number pad, but the LG's is the crammed version.  For me this is between soldered ram or not. If 1 is soldered, then I'll have a tough decision. \n\nSo, please pop the back cover and let us know?\n\nThanks!!",
  "I reached out to Dell. They confirmed its 2x SO-DIMM slots that support up to 64GB RAM!",
  "You’ll need to consider whether you want a gaming laptop or not. The Vostro is not a gaming laptop and won’t perform like one. It is a premium build quality well rounded business laptop with top specs. It will get hot when gaming over long periods of time. If you want something with more power you should consider the Lenovo legion slim 7 or if you don’t want a gamery feeling laptop the Ideapad 5 pro 16.",
  "Do you know if it has one or two M.2 SSD slots/what the storage upgrade options are like?",
  "Hi there, have you been able to play AoE4 on it since the release of the game and would you recommend this laptop for this game? I am looking for a decent laptop for everiday tasks, with a moderate price, and not especially oriented for gaming but I would love to be able to run AoE4 (but no other AAA games that are massively demanding on GPU, CPU and memory).",
  "I just got this laptop RTX3050 version, and I have to say, I believe the design around the battery life and cooling system is very poor. I thought mine is broken, after reading similar stories from other owners similar experiences are confirmed. I’m frustrated and disappointed with this product from Dell. The battery needing to be bigger and cooling system larger. IMO it’s flawed heavily. You can’t game on it either, the RTX3050 is very weak. The screen is average. Considered returning it for a different model but I’m too busy at work. \n\nWould not go with a dell laptop again. I could of paid slightly more and got a different manufacturer with better specifications and most likely none of these cooling and battery issues.\n\nSorry Dell, but this product is piss poor.\n\nEdit: ram dota2 as a test, can’t even get more than 30fps avg, 1080p max textures details. My desktop with Radeon RX5700XT and an old 6 core sandy bridgy CPU sits just below 200 avg\n\n30fps avg in an esports game isn’t playable.\n\nEdit2:  it sure what dell were targeting with its design, it can’t go anywhere without its charger very nearby. Poor gaming performance, terrible thermals. That leaves users with an always plugged laptop that only runs word processing applications and runs like a volcano doing it.\n\nEdit3: screen is 60hz. 2021 they release a mid range laptop with this? Dell are you high? Reason I bought it? It was 40% off. I almost got my boss one whilst awaiting shipping. Pretty glad I didn’t get my employer an absolute dud laptop, that seems like dell were trying to offload\n\nEdit4: finally. At work we run all dell emc servers. Lost a lot of faith on dell consumer, and as a whole if they are pulling this kind of crap I n 2021. We are due for a major upgrade, HPE looking much more convincing",
  "So good",
  "I would wonder why the GTX card if not gaming... I mean, the type of computing (ML, linear algebra) I use for work with an Nvidia card is more demanding than gaming.  If it can't handle gaming, then it can't handle a work setting that requires a GPU.  Otherwise, most workers don't need a dedicated GPU for work (with Word, browsing, etc).  Just puzzled, what's the point of providing a GPU that can't handle gaming.",
  "I have one, same specs as OP but regular 3050, not Ti. It has 2x m.2 slots. The OEM ssd is a very short m2 2230 drive. The other M2 slot can take a normal full length SSD. The short OEM 2230 ssd drive is in the longer m2 slot with a weird metal arm to anchor it to the screw down hole at the end. So if you buy one of these you need to move the OEM ssd to the other m2 slot, then stick your full length SSD in the m2 slot you just took the OEM out of.\n\nIt's easy, and already inside the case are the two heat sinks for SSDs. One small copper one for the OEM shorter 2230 ssd, and a full size heatsink for a normal m2 ssd. \n\nEdit: As per my reply to the other guy below, the battery life is absolute ass on this.",
  "I can run the new Diablo 2 resurrected/remaster on this at max graphics no problem, as long as it's plugged in. That game is a little heavier that you would expect on resources. My Ryzen 4800u with integrated graphics can only handle about low medium graphics. So this thing's pretty decent.\n\nDepending on what you're doing, keep in mind the **battery life is horrible** on this thing. I'm getting worse life than OP when just doing very basic light tasks. I get 3 1/2 to 4 hours max. This is with screen brightness low, no USB devices, the 3050 dGPU disabled, and just using a webbrowser. No gaming or streaming. I've done all manner of tests to squeeze out better battery life and have had not luck (OS reinstall clean, different drivers, setting max CPU usage to 30%, etc.). Dell support told me 4 hours is good battery life for this laptop and referred to the battery as a ***backup battery***.\n\nAlso, if you plan to dual boot to linux this thing won't sleep properly. You can set it to suspend, which defaults to s2idle and uses about 14% battery per hour. Manually modifying the system to deep sleep doesn't work properly, it will start to sleep, then spin up the fans and turn on the keyboard light. This is with Nvidia proprietary driver software and the dGPU off and iGPU on. After researching it, lot's of dell notebooks are doing thing. Dell's forums show things like \"this model doesn't support being set to suspend/sleep and put in a bookbag\".\n\nHopefully this info helps. I'm in the process of returning mine. It's a nice enough laptop, but averaging 3.5 hours of battery life from extremally light tasks with my mentioned battery saving attempts is bad, the linux sleep thing is bad too.\n\nIf you'll mostly be on AC power all day, you'll be fine. But if you're on battery it will not last. Gaming will kill the battery even faster, and it will lower its performance dropping the frame rate badly on battery.",
  "Hey I think your laptop may be broken or you are using it unplugged, because a 3050 usually runs dota 2 at around 120fps at the 65W. Do you run dota while plugged in? because it only uses the integrated intel graphics when unplugged which could explain the low fps.",
  "I ended up buying the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro with an RTX card, dual DIMM slots, and dual SSD slots.  It's a great laptop as long as you don't need battery life beyond 3-4 hours.  LOL",
  "Hey question, are you using windows 10 or 11? I know windows 11 has hit ALOT of laptops negatively in terms of battery life. I’ve heard some people getting up to 4 hours less than they would in windows 10.",
  "To tell the truth I didn’t run it more than a few hours on win10. I did find turning on battery saver made a difference, but it wasn’t major enough. I did also find apps like the brave browser automatically using the dGPU for no reason, setting windows to force it into the iGPU helped a bit.\n\nI did run manjero Linux and was getting batter battery life than when 11, but maybe just an extra 30 mins of light usage.\n\nOver all, I think the battery capacity (56Wh) is just a bit too low for something with an 11800h and dGPU. I tried buying an 86Wh battery from Dell before sending the Vostro back, but they don’t have them in stock.\n\nI moved to a Lenovo P1 G4. That has a 91wH battery, It’s easy to get 4.5-5 hours on that thing without effort.\n\nEdit: more info.",
  "Oh okay thank you for specifying more! Yeah brave turns on hardware acceleration by default for some reason. It’s quite annoying 😂 had a time I was wondering why my laptop fans were spooling up every time I opened brave and was always at a steady 10-30% usage.",
  "Yeah lol, I happened to be looking at task manager and noticed GPU_1 in use with just an empty downloads tab open. Need max power for that.\n\nOther than the battery life, I did really like that vostro.",
  "Need advice on which laptop to buy Hey everyone, after researching for various laptops I cannot decide on which model to buy. Maybe anyone knows a model which I haven't checked out yet.\n\nI have a midrange gaming PC that I game on and I am looking for a new laptop that I want to use occasionally when coding while sitting in my living room with my girlfriend and to be able to do light gaming when on vacation. (I am a software developer)\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n15-16 inch screen size:\nI am coming from a 13 inch Zenbook from 2015 and while I thought 14 inch was the sweet spot for me I realized that I can be much more productive on a bigger screen, 16 inch would be perfect since 14:10 ratio is nice for productivity. I watched advice for coding laptops already and they say that resolutions higher than 1080p are recommended so that should also be added to the display requirements. I want to be able to read stuff on the screen in sunlight so preferable bright display and not glossy.\n\nGPU: i want to to some light gaming therefore I think a dedicated GPU is better., 3050 should be plenty enough though. I saw benchmarks of the Ryzen 6000 and Ryzen 7000 Igpu and I am not sure if they have enough performance. Games I wanna play are aoe4, cities Skylines 2 and anno 1800, as well as older titles.\n\nThunderbolt / usb 4 is not required, I would like to have usb C charging though as some models I saw do not have that. (The Asus vivobook with Ryzen 5000 series for example). As for GPU I read that 11th gen intel is kinda shit, 12th gen is a huge step forward? Correct me if I am wrong. I am an amd fanboy though so Ryzen 5000 or 6000 is preferred.\n\n16GB of ram, upgradeable if possible. I would not mind having 32 also.\n\nStorage does not matter as I am probably going to use / buy an SSD that I like. If it has 1TB that's a bonus.\n\nIt does not have to be a thin & light Model, weight is not that important, however the dimensions should not be that big, I enjoy small bezels. Some gaming laptop are super ugly and I am not sure why they do that as the specs are pretty interesting for programmers. (Keyboard backlight is great but who needs RGB?)\n\nMy selection so far:\n\nAsus vivobook 16 pro (there are many versions, 6000 version or 12th gen intel are my favourites, has rtx 3050, oled looks cool, worried about sunlight though. Vivobook 14 was my favourite until I saw how small 14 inch is in store)\n\nLenovo Legion 5 pro (there are models with rtx 3060 which has 6gb vram, is there a model with higher resolution and usb charging?)\n\nLenovo yoga slim 7 pro (cheaper than the vivobook, but reviews are pretty bad, not really convinced about brightness either)\n\nAsus Zephyrus g15 (again a gaming notebook looks nice from specs and quality, was looking at the g14 too but it's probably too small)\n\nI don't really have a set budget but initially I was looking to stay below 1000€. I guess that's not gonna meet with my requirements though. No problem with buying used btw.\n\nI would appreciate your recommendations or experiences with the models mentioned above.",
  "Hi there,\n\nFirstly, you’re wrong about the Intel iGPU; it was the step from 10th to 11th (G7 at the end) where graphics proved massively. \n\nAnyway, since you’re buying a dGPU it doesn’t really matter anyway. I just bought a Vivobook myself, I love it but it does have a glossy finish. The Yoga devices have problems with the hinges, but the displays are pretty nice (not Vivobook OLED nice though). \n\nLegion 5 is a solid machine but maybe a bit bulky?",
  "How is lenovo Ideapad slim 5 Ryzen 7 7735HS. If anyone have this laptop i really wanna know the reviews. Nd battery too.",
  "FIrst and foremost doubt. Why is the title and description says 7735HS and the options below says 7735U?\n\nBoth of them are good performers. If we go to specifics, both have same cores and threads, 95% details are same between those twooo.\n\nThe only difference is:\n\n* **7735HS** is 15% better in multi-core performance than 7735U. HS is 15% better in performance than U.\n* **7735U** has better performance per watt, meaning slightly higher battery power than 7735HS. U has better efficency than HS (maybe like 10mins more depending on the usage).\n\nMake sure you are getting the model that you are looking for. The seller might have done the incorrect information, but just to make sure you are getting the same contact with them and confirm once. Just a precautionary.\n\n**Disclaimer:** These are rough calculations.",

  "# Downsides & Limitations\n\nOf course, nothing is perfect, so here are some quirks I found:\n\n* **No proper Android drivers** – I tried installing a custom ROM via `fastboot`, but the device didn’t show up. No solution yet.\n* **Android development on ARM is still rough** – It’ll take time before things become fully native.\n* **No OS change option** – Coming from Linux, this was frustrating. Snapdragon promised proper Linux support, but that still seems far away. That said, **WSL has been a lifesaver**, and Windows has been surprisingly pleasant for my use case.\n* **Gaming is not natively supported** – I don’t game, but knowing that most games won’t run natively is still a con. Hopefully, ARM gaming support improves.\n\nHonestly, the **biggest con I expected was Windows itself**—I assumed it would be painful after using Linux.

  "Title: 7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Says It’s a Game Changer in 2025 🎮 Hey everyone,\n\nI just read this review titled *“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025”* and thought it’d be worth sharing/discussing. (Link included below.)  \nHere’s a quick breakdown + my take — would love to hear what you all think:\n\n# 🔍 Key Highlights from the Review\n\n1. **Top-tier graphics & processing** – It leans on Intel + latest RTX (5000 series) hardware for serious gaming punch.\n2. **Stunning OLED 240 Hz display** – Crisp visuals, high refresh, rich colors.\n3. **Performance & cooling optimized** – Good thermal design (especially on a stand) helps sustain heavy loads.\n4. **Strong build quality & premium feel** – Materials and finish got good praise.\n5. **Quiet / balance modes are effective** – You don’t always have to blast full power.\n6. **Decent audio & ports** – For a gaming laptop, it doesn’t skimp too much.\n7. **Some compromises & trade-offs** – Battery life is underwhelming, smudge-prone surfaces, and the new port layout (sides vs back) isn’t ideal for everyone.\n\n# My Thoughts & Questions\n\n* This looks like a beast if you mostly use it plugged in — for gaming, video, creative work. But if you're mobile and need long unplugged sessions, the battery life sounds weak (which echoed in other reviews too).\n* The OLED + 240 Hz combo is tempting, but in bright environments, reflections may kill the vibe.\n* Side instead of rear ports is a controversial change — ergonomics over aesthetics?\n* I’m curious: for folks who’ve tried it, how is it in real-world use (noise, heat, battery wear)?\n\n**Link to full review (for reference):**  \n“7 Powerful Reasons the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 Review Proves It’s a Game Changer in 2025” [mesnbot.com](https://mesnbot.com/7-powerful-reasons-the-lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-10-review-proves-its-a-game-changer-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

  "Ideapad slim 5 16imh9 16\" Planning to buy one during the BBD sale, but found many reviews mentioning trackpad issues. Anyone who's personally faced this issue? Or how's the laptop in general? Need it for studying and coding purpose, no gaming as such. ",
  "I need help deciding between Omen max 16 and legion slim 5 gen 10 Hi, as the title says, I am hesitating between these 2 laptops, they have similar configuration and price so I need help deciding if you guys can provide some experiences with any of the machines.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y115jc3cyhqf1.png?width=2037&format=png&auto=webp&s=88849fd0a65d1dc077c82d8a3a8d6cd278f193a7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzs2tc3cyhqf1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7f803bf850c53606ef992db39563bc539c45def\n\nThe things I'm worried about in the legion is the super-reflective OLED, as from what I've seen in these types of screens, they are super distracting and sometimes impractical. For the omen, it's mainly about the weight which is a 0.5 kg difference. Other than that, I'm looking for something that would last at the very least 4 years (of course I'd have to take good care of it). I'm open to hearing your concerns, experiences and recommendations. Thanks",
  "Would you recommend this for gaming? Lenovo Legion 5 OLED 15IRX10 I'm planning to buy a new laptop for gaming and work. And I found this new laptop. What do you think about it? \n\n\nThis is the spec:\n\nScreen size\t15,1 inches\nProcessor\tIntel Core i7\nInternal RAM\t24 GB\nTotal storage capacity\t512 GB\nVideo card\tNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070\n\n\n\n",
  "It's pretty good imo, I'd probably install another m. 2 afterwards cause 512gb is just not enough nowadays.",
  "are you grateful about screen size ? it looks like small.",
  "Thank you. I would do the same. But do you think Legion is a solid choice?",
  "Yeah, legion series has gotten significantly better in the past couple of years, balancing in price, build quality and performance.",
  "Lenovo Legion Slim 7 resale value? Hello. How much should I reasonably expect to get for this laptop through private selling on FB or what have you. Thank you. \n",
  "800-900",
  "any reviews on Lenovo Yoga Slim 7X Gen 9? could anyone who owns this laptop give a brief review on its battery life, noises, and screen (burn in, etc)? \n\ni've seen reviews on just josh youtube and it seems too good to be true for its price, but what's holding me back is that it doesn't have an audio jack nor a USB port.",
  "I think the lack of answers is an answer in itself. I was also interested in this laptop, but I don't think it meets my needs, which may overlap with yours.",
  "i ended up getting an ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED instead hahahaha. but it's been great so far! the battery lasts about 10 hours, there's little to no noises, and i haven't experienced anything unusual with the OLED screen either!",
  "Lenovo Legion 5 slim Charger Issue I can't fix this..Give solution..Why 😭",
  "You've got the wrong plug type, you'll need either a different power cable or a converter though they aren't recommended",
  "This only I got with the laptop",
  "Yeh, that cable is for a different region, you can buy a new one off of Amazon for pretty cheap any cable with the same plug it has on the other end works",

  "Legion 5 Gen 10 vs 5i vs Alienware 16 Aurora vs 16 X Hello everyone,\n\nI'm going to study abroad soon and I need a laptop that can do it all. I made a pre-selection which seemed interesting in terms of quality and price but I will need advice to be able to decide because it is the first PC at this price and with gaming characteristics that I am going to buy. \n\nSo here are the characteristics of the 4 computers that I selected: \n\nLegion 5 Gen 10 (15' AMD)\n-AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 (or the 260?)\n-ram 32go ddr5 600MT/s (2x16go)\n-1TB ssd m.2 2242PCIe Gen 4 TLC\n-15.1’ (2560x1600) OLED screen, 500nits, 165Hz\n-nvidia 5060 8gb \n-80Wh battery\n\nPrice: between 1480 and 1520 (varies depending on the processor)\n\n-Legion 5i Gen 10 (15’ Intel)\n-Intel Core I7 14700HX 14th Gen \nSame specifications as the one above\n\nPrice: 1490\n\n-Alienware 16: \n-I7 240H series 2\n-Nvidia 5060 8gb\n-32gb of ddr5 memory (2x16gb)\n-ssd 1to\n-touchpad\n-16’ screen 2560x1600, 120hz, 300cd\n-60Wh battery\n\nPrice: 1199 instead of 1499\n\n-Alienware 16X\n-Intel Ultra 7 255HX\n-16GB of memory 2x8GB\n-240Hz screen\n-96Wh battery \n-the rest similar to the one above \n\nPrice: 1449 instead of 1699\n\n\nMy priority is that the computer can: \n\nHold a day of classes without playing video games.\nA screen with perfect quality.\nBeing able to support any video game.\nBe as quiet as possible (except when playing video games where I expect noise).\n\nFrom what I have read, the problem with the Legion equipped with the i7 is that it consumes a lot of energy even when you are not playing video games because it is not optimized to be on a laptop (I saw between 3 and 5 hours of autonomy). Conversely, the AMD Ryzen 7 allows you to last 10 hours for office activities but is 30% less efficient on demanding video games. \nAt this point should I invest in an RTX 5070 with the AMD Ryzen 7? \n\nFor the Alienware I saw a lot of criticism that it wasn't a real Alienware but a rebadged Dell, then I didn't see any test on the durability of the battery and for video games I also saw several reviews about it.\n\nWhat do you think? \n\nAnd if you have other computers I can advise you!",

  "Ideapad pro 5 vs legion 5 Hi, I am thinking about buying a new laptop for collage and I can't decide which to get. I have been looking at reviews online and so far im interested in ideapad pro 5 gen 10 (ryzen ai 7 350 and rtx 5050) and legion 5 gen 10 (didn't decide on cpu yet and rtx 5060). I care about battery life and fan noise because I spend quite some time in the library. Im also gonna be doing some CAD work for collage and playing some games like minecraft and rocket league (no AAA games) in my free time. Im also open to other suggestions. Thank you :)",
  "Lenovo Pro Yoga 7 vs Lenovo Legion Slim 5 Gen 9 I'm trying to find a laptop for university for engineering and am unsure which one to get. The price difference is $100 with the only difference being 3050 vs 4060 and 14 inch vs 16 inch. I am conflicted as I'm not really going to use it to game as I already have a desktop and the Legion does seem a bit big and heavy. So which one would you recommend I go with",
  "If you’re soooo conflicted then why not go for the middle lane? I would recommend the 15 inch Legion 5 with 5060",
  "That would be ideal but I'd have to pay almost $600 more compared to the other two options",
  "Where are you from and how much do they cost?",
  "Canada and with student discount and coupons I get the Yoga down to 1200 and Legion to 1300",
  "You should first wait for the Legion 5 to go on sale/discount THEN apply your student discount + stacked coupons + using the discount EXTRAFIVE to get the prices even lower. Right now it recently just arrived on the Lenovo website which is why it’s not on sale obviously.",
  "Acer Swift 14 AI (S14-15-768H) Ultra Core 7 vs Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 (83CV008 NPH) Ultra Core 5 Im planning to buy a personal laptop since my 10 year old Asus laptop obviously should be put down. \n\nNow im having a dilemma which should I get. I have read reviews and watched a ton of videos so now Im now very confused. Im not a techy person so this is overwhelming for me. \n\nMy first choice is really the Lenovo line. This is a bias one since I have a company owned Thinkpad T series laptop. So it's a pretty high standard for me. \n\nOn the other hand, the Acer Swift has higher specs than the Yoga Slim 7 in general. However, given the Acer's reputation on overheating and its  build, Im thinking twice if I should take a risk on Acer Swift 14 AI, given this is one of their latest premium models (released 2024). Acer also has a bigger discount and freebies so it feels a bit of too good to be true deal.\n\nShould i go for the well regarded Lenovo or take a risk on the newer Acer Swift?",

  "Lenovo Legion Slim 5 vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Hi all!\n\nI am looking to purchase my first gaming laptop and need some help with the final decision. I am only considering 14\" models as I travel frequently and will have to carry it to and from work every day.\n\nI have effectively narrowed it down to 2 choices, which are around the same price (pre-owned):\n\nLenovo Legion Slim 5 14.5\" OLED - AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS - 16 GB - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 - 1 TB SSD\n\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 14\" OLED - AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS - 16GB - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 - 1 TB SSD\n\nIn my research, it seems that these are perhaps the two best 14\" gaming laptops on the market. Am I just splitting hairs at this point? Which would you go with and why?",

Anyone who used this whats your review? What’s the pros and cons. Should I buy it or go for another laptop. Any suggestions are accepted. Thank you.",
  "Legions generally are pretty decent machines. I've got a 5 Pro from 2021 and it has held up perfectly. \nOnly downside on the newer models is the non replacable keyboard, as it is plastic welded into the palmrest.",
  "Lenovo Legion Slim 5 14APH8 battery drain Hello good people,\n\nI have question for you, since I got this laptop last year (it was new), I am unhappy with battery life. I tried to do some optimization and tweaks, I even called lenovo support, everybody said the laptop is fine. Lenovo is saying max battery life is aprox 10hours, which is a joke compared to the fact what I am getting. I understand max battery life means doing nothing with the laptop but still. I lost now cca 15% of battery during 15 minutes of browser time while writing this post, with nothing else in background and screen on cca 50% of intensity. Basically I would say my battery time during some browsing and light work is aprox 1-1,5 hour, which for me is unacceptable and basically its losing meaning of laptop. Lenovo vantage is saying that battery is in good health.\n\nDo you have any ideas, tips or tricks for me ? thank you",

  "Is the Ideapad Slim 5 good? Hi, I’m asking for your help to determine if this laptop will be good enough for 5 years of use during grad school. \nIt’s the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Ci5 210H / 16GB / SSD1000 / 14 / Win11 / (83J0001DRK) \nI’ve been struggling with finding the reviews for this exact model, therefore I am asking for your help. \nHere are some of its features: \nCPU Intel Core i5‑210H (14th Gen, Meteor Lake) \nCores/Threads 8 cores / 12 threads \nBase / Turbo Speed 2.2 GHz / up to 4.8 GHz GPU Intel Iris Xe Graphics (Integrated) RAM 16 GB LPDDR5 (soldered) \nStorage 1 TB SSD (M.2 NVMe) \nOS Windows 11 \nBattery 60 Wh\n\nIt’s a 14”, and a light one, which is something I paid close attention to, as my previous laptop was quite heavy. I don’t think that I will be running really heavy/hard programs on it, but I do think that I will probably use it on a daily basis for multiple hours. Thank you in advance!"
